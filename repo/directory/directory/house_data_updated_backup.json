Vern Buchanan \\\\n[chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Good morning. I want to thank our \\\\nwitnesses for being here today to discuss the crucial issues \\\\nbefore us, the collapse of the private practice and the impact \\\\nit is having on patients, as well.\\\\n    Americans across the country are hurt by skyrocketing \\\\ninflation from the past four years. I am a former business \\\\nowner, and I know firsthand how inflation harms small \\\\nbusinesses trying to benefit their communities. Physicians are \\\\nno different. Nearly 90 percent of the medical groups reported \\\\nincreased operating costs last year, according to the Medical \\\\nGroup Management Association. Physicians&#x27; costs increased by \\\\nover 63 percent from 2013 to 2022, making it harder to run a \\\\nbusiness, let alone their own practice.\\\\n    During the same timeframe, Medicare&#x27;s formula for \\\\ncalculating physician payments has increased by only 1.7 \\\\npercent. In fact, the--adjusted for inflation, the practice \\\\ncost--Medicare physicians&#x27; pay rate plummeted 29 percent over \\\\nthe past 2 decades, with large changes year over year. So how \\\\ncan we get doctors to afford to stay in private practice when \\\\ntheir costs are skyrocketing, their reimbursement rates \\\\ncontinue to get cut?\\\\n    Many times, physicians are forced to sell their practice or \\\\nconsolidate, and with a larger system stay afloat. Let me be \\\\nclear. Whether or not to sell a practice should be the choice \\\\nof the physician based on what works best for them, their \\\\nfamily, their practice, and their patients. They should not be \\\\nforced into a practice consolidation.\\\\n    And I will just tell you myself, as a businessperson for 30 \\\\nyears before I got here, I started, my wife and I, a small \\\\nbusiness. It was the American dream. We created 5,000 jobs from \\\\nnothing as a couple of blue-collar kids. So a lot of times that \\\\nleads to other opportunities. I am not saying that is good or \\\\nbad or indifferent, but that is just my story. But there is \\\\nother stories like that. So when I hear people are getting \\\\ncrunched in terms of whether they can even stay in practice, I \\\\ndon&#x27;t like hearing that. But I will talk more about that today.\\\\n    Further, I am concerned that our--being transformed from \\\\nentrepreneurs into employees. According to American Medical \\\\nAssociation, the AMA, between 2012 and 2022 the share of \\\\nphysicians working in private practice fell by 13 percent \\\\ncompared to 3 decades ago, where there were--there are now 30 \\\\npercent fewer physicians in private practice. A thriving health \\\\ncare ecosystem should be included in a balance of large health \\\\nsystems and small, local, mom-and-pop practices.\\\\n    Back in the day, it was much easier and less expensive for \\\\nyoung doctors coming out of medical school to start a practice \\\\nin their hometown. Now, when I talk to young doctors coming out \\\\nof medical school, many of them tell me it is too expensive of \\\\nan endeavor, and they would rather work for a larger system, \\\\nwhere they can collect a steady paycheck and not worry about \\\\nthe increasing administrative burdens associated with running a \\\\npractice.\\\\n    Another issue I continue to hear from our docs is the \\\\ngrowing rate of frivolous lawsuits against medical--the medical \\\\ncommunity. AMA analysts show that in 2019 medical liability \\\\npremiums increased by 27 percent, almost double the rate from \\\\n2018. Between 2020 and roughly 2022, 30 percent of premiums \\\\nincrease year to year. I am extremely worried about the \\\\npressure the trial bar is putting on physicians, at least in my \\\\nstate. I can talk about that, and then I hope that we can talk \\\\nabout what it costs, defensive medicine, and many of the \\\\ndoctors that are surgeons, maybe they are 60, they are leaving \\\\ntheir practices early because they don&#x27;t want to take the \\\\npotential risk.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. With that I look forward to the \\\\ndiscussion today. Now I recognize the Ranking Member Doggett \\\\nfor his opening remarks. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. DOGGETT. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This \\\\nis an important set of issues that affects our health care \\\\nproviders, and it affects the quality of health care.\\\\n    I come at it from the experience of having a father who was \\\\nin solo practice as a dentist for about 35 years. I handled the \\\\nyard work and the cleanup around there, but I still meet a few \\\\npeople who were children when he practiced who valued that \\\\npersonalized care and remind me of it.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s health care system is so much different. I don&#x27;t \\\\nthink in any part of health care that kind of experience could \\\\noccur. There are so many barriers to entry and getting a \\\\npractice started and then maintaining it and so, we find today \\\\nover 70 percent of physicians who are employed by a health care \\\\nsystem or a corporate entity. This consolidation is creating \\\\ngreater obstacles for the few remaining independent \\\\npractitioners who are struggling to compete, and has \\\\nsignificant implications for taxpayers and patients.\\\\n    There are so many challenges. Your testimony, from \\\\nreviewing it, deals with a number of them that our physicians \\\\nare facing. And while I agree that physicians are sometimes \\\\nover-regulated, the regulator that seems to be interfering the \\\\nmost for many comes in the form of private Medicare Advantage \\\\nplans.\\\\n    MA plans continue to interfere with the doctor-patient \\\\nrelationship through burdensome prior authorization \\\\nrequirements, step therapy, and other management tools. \\\\nIntended to reduce unnecessary health care utilization, these \\\\ntools often lead to delays and denials of urgent medical care. \\\\nOne study found that 82 percent of denials that were appealed \\\\nwere ultimately overturned and found to be necessary and \\\\nappropriate care. But a small, independent practice that is \\\\nstruggling to get a prior authorization request approved often \\\\ncan&#x27;t afford to go forward with the appeal.\\\\n    For the care that is delivered, many physicians face \\\\ninadequate payment, and I know you will be discussing that. \\\\nMedicaid reimbursement in my home state of Texas is pitiful. We \\\\nall know well that the Medicare physician fee schedule is a \\\\nsource of stress that we hear about each year. We are hearing \\\\nabout it from health care practitioners across the country.\\\\n    Private MA plans, however, frequently provide lower \\\\npayments than traditional Medicare, which is difficult to \\\\nbelieve. At the same time, in an upside-down system, Medicare \\\\nAdvantage is being dramatically overpaid, $84 billion in wasted \\\\ntaxpayer dollars this year alone. Yet, insurers are not \\\\nrequired to reimburse doctors at least the traditional Medicare \\\\nrates. With Medicare Advantage now providing coverage for over \\\\nhalf of Medicare beneficiaries, physicians are being squeezed \\\\nfurther.\\\\n    As recommended by the independent Medicare Payment Advisory \\\\nCommission, MedPAC--sometimes the source of great concern and \\\\ncriticism by health care practitioners--but on this issue they \\\\nsay that approval of an inflation update is very important. We \\\\nmust find an acceptable way to pay for that update. But I think \\\\nthat an inflation update alone, though that is a priority of \\\\nphysicians now, is not a panacea. That schedule has become \\\\nlargely irrelevant if over half of the people covered by \\\\nMedicare are being handled through private Medicare Advantage \\\\nplans that distort the payment system.\\\\n    We need to strike a balance to protect the long-term \\\\nsolvency of Medicare, and hold these MA plans accountable for \\\\nappropriately reimbursing providers. Payment tweaks alone will \\\\nnot address what is already a broken market.\\\\n    Due to a lack of antitrust enforcement, nearly 80 percent \\\\nof metropolitan areas have highly concentrated physician \\\\nmarkets. Independent physicians are struggling to compete, as \\\\nthey not only face a competing practice being taken over by \\\\nprivate equity, but the same forces leading to vertical \\\\nconsolidation that use their immense resources to buy a \\\\nhospital system and physician practices forcing the few \\\\nremaining independent providers out of network.\\\\n    For many independent practices, private equity can appear \\\\nto be a savior. For physicians struggling to compete with a \\\\nlarge health care group, it is easy to understand the allure of \\\\nthese PE buyouts and quick cash infusion. Private equity may \\\\nhelp some of these practices, but too often any benefit is \\\\nsolely to the senior physicians who may be about to retire. In \\\\nmy hometown of Austin, I have seen the aftermath of these \\\\nbuyouts. Junior associates, nursing staff, administrative \\\\nsupport teams are fired. Prices increase and doctors are \\\\npressured to prioritize profits over patients. Practices either \\\\ngo bankrupt or are bundled until we have only one physician \\\\ngroup covering a particular specialty.\\\\n    I look forward to your testimony and our discussion on the \\\\nmany anti-competitive behaviors that have gone unrestrained for \\\\ntoo long, and how best we can advance a fair, just, and \\\\naffordable health care system that supports our health care \\\\npractitioners and their patients.\\\\n    Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. I am really excited. We have \\\\ngot great witnesses today, you guys that are actually in the \\\\ntrenches. Many of us up here haven&#x27;t been where you have been, \\\\nand you are dealing with the reality, especially in the last 10 \\\\nyears or so.\\\\n    So the witnesses: Dr. Jennifer Gholson out of Mississippi; \\\\nDr. Tim Richardson, a private physician out of Wichita, Kansas; \\\\nChris Kean, a private--she is a chief operating officer, so \\\\nthat will be interesting, San Antonio, Texas--Dr. Desai from \\\\nnorth Dallas; and Dr. Jha from--with Brown University.\\\\n    So Doctor, why don&#x27;t we start with you, Dr. Gholson?\\\\n    We will move this way. Five minutes each.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF JENNIFER GHOLSON, MD, FAMILY PRACTITIONER, SUMMIT, \\\\n                          MISSISSIPPI\\\\n\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Doggett, and \\\\ndistinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to testify today. My name is Jennifer Gholson, and \\\\nI am a family physician from Summit, Mississippi. I am honored \\\\nto be here today representing the more than 130,000 physicians \\\\nand student members of the American Academy of Family \\\\nPhysicians. My remarks today are made in my capacity as a AAFP \\\\nrepresentative, and do not reflect the opinions of my employer \\\\nor any other organizations with which I am affiliated.\\\\n    As a former solo practice owner, I applaud the committee \\\\nfor holding today&#x27;s hearing. It was not long ago that the \\\\nmajority of primary care was delivered by physicians in solo or \\\\nindependent practice who were uniquely connected to the \\\\ncommunity they served. However, over the last few decades, we \\\\nhave propped up a health care system with misaligned incentives \\\\nthat rewards consolidation and under-invest in primary care. \\\\nEvery system is perfectly designed to achieve the results it \\\\ngets, and our current system is designed to ensure the death of \\\\nindependent medicine.\\\\n    I have practiced primary care for more than 20 years. In \\\\n2011 I opened my own brick-and-mortar family medicine practice \\\\nin my rural community which had lacked any primary care \\\\npractices previously. To say running my own practice was hard \\\\nwould be an understatement, but it was also rewarding. Plans \\\\nprovided no transparency on their contracted rates, meaning I \\\\ndidn&#x27;t know what I would be paid until I had already signed on \\\\nthe dotted line. Many plans also closed their networks \\\\ncompletely and would not contract with me initially.\\\\n    I was an early adopter of value-based payment through \\\\nparticipation in an ACO, where we achieved share savings while \\\\nproviding quality care to patients. I am grateful that I had \\\\nthe opportunity to participate in an ACO. There was at least \\\\none year when the shared savings payment helped me keep my \\\\npractice doors open.\\\\n    When the pandemic hit, and Mississippi required us to stop \\\\nseeing patients in person, we were able to pivot to providing \\\\ncare via telehealth the very next day. I was able to cultivate \\\\nmeaningful, trusted relationships with my patients, many of \\\\nwhom became like family, while maintaining my own clinical \\\\nautonomy and decision-making authority.\\\\n    Around 2021, the tide started to change. Prior \\\\nauthorizations were increasing while payments were shrinking. \\\\nPhysician practices already get paid two to three times less \\\\nfor services than hospitals, who are able to charge facility \\\\nfees.\\\\n    Primary care is at its best when it is delivered by a \\\\nphysician-led team. However, it was hard for my practice and \\\\nothers to compete with hospitals for the same staff. They can \\\\noffer signing bonuses, higher base salaries, an array of \\\\ntechnology that practices often can&#x27;t.\\\\n    Eventually, the draw of hospital employment became too \\\\nalluring for my staff. I had the privilege of working with an \\\\nincredible nurse for my--almost my entire career. She ended up \\\\nleaving because, as she put it, primary care had become too \\\\nhard, and she couldn&#x27;t do it anymore. She went to work for a \\\\nhospital-employed pulmonologist. We both cried when she left. \\\\nSoon after, both MPs on my team decided to leave, as well. One \\\\nwent to a hospital-owned practice closer to her home, and the \\\\nother to a subcontractor for managed care companies that offer \\\\nmore flexibility.\\\\n    After they left, I tried to make things work, but the hits \\\\nkept coming and burnout seemed inevitable. For example, health \\\\nplans started clawing back money that they had already paid me \\\\nbecause of minor billing mistakes, instead of allowing me to \\\\nresubmit claims. Eventually, for myself and for my patients, I \\\\nhad to reevaluate whether keeping my practice doors open was \\\\nthe right choice. I knew it would take at least six months to \\\\ntry and replace my staff, and the administrative burden I faced \\\\nfurther eroded the time I was able to spend on patient care.\\\\n    In the decades since I opened my practice, a pharmacy, an \\\\nurgent care, and a physical therapist had also opened in my \\\\nsmall town. The presence of my practice has made a positive \\\\neconomic impact on the community and, most importantly, a \\\\npositive personal impact on my patients.\\\\n    I decided to close my practice in the summer of 2022. While \\\\nthis is my story, it is not unique. It is the story of many \\\\nother family physicians who have been forced into a false \\\\nchoice of either selling their practice, often for pennies, or \\\\nclosing their doors entirely.\\\\n    Thankfully, Congress can advance policies that will better \\\\nsupport the success of practices of all sizes and ownership \\\\ntypes. These include improving payment for primary care, \\\\naddressing misaligned incentives such as facility fees that \\\\nencourage consolidation, and minimizing the administrative \\\\nburden that independent practices face.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify and share my \\\\nstory. I look forward to answering your questions.\\\\n    [The statement of Dr. Gholson follows:]\\\\n    GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thanks, Doctor.\\\\n    Dr. Richardson.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY RICHARDSON, MD, INDEPENDENT PHYSICIAN, \\\\n                        WICHITA UROLOGY\\\\n\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member \\\\nDoggett, I am Dr. Timothy Richardson, a urologist and partner \\\\nin Wichita Urology, an independent physician practice in \\\\nWichita, Kansas. I also serve as a board member of the Large \\\\nUrology Group Practice Association.\\\\n    My practice is a single specialty group of 12 doctors that \\\\nserve over 1.1 million lives in a geographic area covering two-\\\\nthirds of the State of Kansas. We have 13 clinic locations \\\\nthroughout the state that makes it possible for the rural \\\\npatients to receive critical cancer care and advanced \\\\nurological treatments where they live.\\\\n    We greatly appreciate the Ways and Means Committee interest \\\\nin examining the challenges facing independent physician \\\\npractices.\\\\n    While Wichita Urology is no stranger to the mounting \\\\npressures independent practices face, we are fortunate to have \\\\nremained independent. Unfortunately, this is not the case for \\\\nmany of the other practices across the country, despite a \\\\ncommitment to their patients and their communities.\\\\n    In response to the double whammy of increasing regulatory \\\\nand administrative burdens alongside declining reimbursement, \\\\nindependent physicians have responded by working harder and \\\\nmore, leading to burnout and early retirement, thereby \\\\ncompounding the shortages and the onus on those who remain in \\\\nthe practice. In fact, yesterday I personally performed 10 \\\\nsurgical procedures and saw 24 clinic patients before racing to \\\\ncatch a 3:00 p.m. flight to be with you here today.\\\\n    I am reminded of what occurred to a colleague&#x27;s practice in \\\\nShreveport, Louisiana, which peaked at 20 urologists but over \\\\ntime dwindled down to 8 as hospitals recruited their doctors, \\\\nwho could be relieved essentially of 100 percent of their \\\\nadministrative, practice management, and regulatory burdens \\\\novernight, alongside an RVU pay schedule that substantially \\\\nreduced their patient care burdens.\\\\n    In the face of seemingly endless, expanding workload in \\\\nprivate practice, hospitals can offer higher starting salaries \\\\non the promise of a work-life balance that limits working \\\\nhours. Pay differentials, subsidized by site-of-service \\\\ndisparities, made it impossible for them to compete for the \\\\nnursing staff. That practice eventually collapsed, and the \\\\npatient access plummeted as more physicians left the practice \\\\nand the hospital system that acquired the group closed all of \\\\nthe outlying offices northern--in the northern part of the \\\\nstate, where there had formerly been 11 clinic sites.\\\\n    Just as important, patients lost a one-stop-shop of \\\\ncoordinated and personalized care with physician-patient \\\\nrelationships that had been built over the decades with \\\\npatients and their families.\\\\n    This is not an isolated incident, but a nationwide trend. \\\\nHospital-employed physicians increased by more than 70 percent \\\\nbetween 2012 and 2018, and another 5.1 percent between 2022 and \\\\n2023. More than half of the physicians are now employed by \\\\nhospitals.\\\\n    It is not hard to understand why. Hospitals have focused on \\\\nacquiring physician practices because that strategy \\\\nsimultaneously quashes competition in the local market and \\\\ncaptures downstream revenue from ancillary services such as \\\\nradiation therapy, imaging, and physician-administered drugs, \\\\noften times purchased at 340B prices.\\\\n    The revenue a physician generates for a hospital employer \\\\nfar surpasses the cost of the employed physician&#x27;s salary. For \\\\nexample, a recent Merritt survey found that urologists generate \\\\n$2.1 million while receiving an average salary of 386,000. \\\\nSimilar returns on investments exist for other specialists.\\\\n    A major factor contributing to provider consolidation is \\\\nthe inability of private practices to remain financially \\\\nviable. Medicare reimbursement payment updates do not come \\\\nclose to matching the rising practice costs. More recently, \\\\nphysicians have taken payment cuts. Physicians only received a \\\\nnominal 10 percent increase over the last two decades, while \\\\nthe practice cost inflation rose 47 percent. That is simply not \\\\nsustainable.\\\\n    Meanwhile, hospitals have received compounding payment \\\\nupdates based on their input cost, amounting to 70 percent over \\\\nthe last two decades, and enjoy a substantial site-of-service \\\\npayment advantage for the identical services. As an example, \\\\nMedicare pays hospitals more than twice the amount a physician \\\\nreceives for a cystoscopy with lithotripsy stent procedure at \\\\nan ambulatory surgery center, even though this requires \\\\nessentially the same staff, infrastructure, time, and technical \\\\ntraining to perform. Similarly, hospitals receive more than \\\\ntwo-and-a-half times more than physicians to infuse identical \\\\npart B drugs.\\\\n    Studies have shown that Medicare could save over $150 \\\\nbillion by equalizing these payment disparities. Yet simply \\\\ncutting the hospitals does not assist physician practices. We \\\\nwould suggest an approach that modestly reduces the HOPD \\\\npayments and modestly increases physician payments to protect \\\\nthe patient access.\\\\n    Just as troubling as the reimbursement challenges is the \\\\nregulatory burden physicians confront, and the lack of \\\\nalternative payment models available to most doctors. Only 17 \\\\npercent of participating providers received an APM incentive \\\\npayment in 2023. CMS failed to implement or even test any of \\\\nthe 17 physician-focused payment models that were recommended \\\\nby PTAC.\\\\n    MIPS has been an even bigger disappointment, and only \\\\nserved to burden physicians with onerous, expensive, and \\\\nlargely meaningless reporting requirements. The MIPS reporting \\\\nprogram costs nearly $13,000 and takes more than 200 hours per \\\\nphysician per year. That is time that could be spent with \\\\npatients.\\\\n    Just as troubling, high performers were not properly \\\\ncompensated because the MIPS&#x27;s zero-sum game provides bonuses \\\\nonly to the degree other physicians are penalized, and less \\\\nthan 0.3 percent were penalized. We agree with MedPAC&#x27;s \\\\nstatement: MIPS is, as presently designed, is unlikely to \\\\nsucceed in helping beneficiaries choose clinicians, helping \\\\nclinicians change practice patterns to improve value, or \\\\nhelping the Medicare program reward clinicians based on value. \\\\nMIPS should be terminated.\\\\n    The Stark Law also remains an impediment to value-based \\\\ncare delivery. It must be modernized to reflect how care is \\\\ndelivered today, not three decades ago, when it was first \\\\nconceived. The physician entrepreneur should be encouraged, not \\\\nvilified.\\\\n    I would like to thank the committee for focusing on \\\\npromoting and protecting independent practices and patients we \\\\nserve. We look forward to working with you to reform these \\\\nprograms to make them more efficient and improve patient \\\\noutcomes.\\\\n    [The statement of Dr. Richardson follows:]\\\\n   GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. I do want to note our next \\\\nwitness.

Five minutes.\\\\n\\\\n STATEMENT OF CHRISTINE KEAN, COO, THE SAN ANTONIO ORTHOPAEDIC \\\\n                             GROUP\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Thank you, Chairman Buchanan and Ranking Member \\\\nDoggett, for allowing me the opportunity to provide boots-on-\\\\nthe-ground testimony about what it is like to be an independent \\\\nmedical practice in health care today. My name is Christine \\\\nKean. I am testifying on behalf of myself, as chief operating \\\\nofficer of TSAOG Orthopedics and Spine, and all 41 physicians \\\\nof our group.\\\\n    We are a fiercely independent, 100 percent physician-owned \\\\ngroup taking care of patients in the greater San Antonio region \\\\nfor over 75 years. I have been fortunate to have worked \\\\nalongside the dedicated physicians and health care \\\\nprofessionals of TSAOG for the past 23 years. The group is a \\\\nfully integrated, private health care entity consisting of non-\\\\noperative physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and \\\\nanesthesiologists. Our physicians and the ones that came before \\\\nthem built this group to help patients navigate an often \\\\nconfusing health care environment by providing as much \\\\nphysician-directed care as possible under a seamless umbrella.\\\\n    Our patients are able to obtain X-rays or more advanced \\\\nimaging such as MRI or CT; receive their physical or hand \\\\ntherapy in person, or even virtually; see us after hours, \\\\nduring the week, and on Saturdays in our urgent care solution, \\\\nOrthoNow; be seen for preventive bone health care. And if they \\\\nrequire surgical intervention, we have two outpatient \\\\nambulatory surgery centers that provide basic and complex \\\\northopedic surgeries to include spine and joint replacements. \\\\nIf inpatient hospital care is required, this will also be \\\\ndirected and led by our physicians at one of three community-\\\\nbased hospitals in the region. Think of us as a small ecosystem \\\\nfor orthopedic care in San Antonio.\\\\n    Creating an entity like this is rare. It is extremely \\\\nchallenging to do, and even more difficult to maintain. It \\\\nrequires our physicians to be fully focused on all aspects of \\\\nthe patient treatment plan, to include their own, as the \\\\nphysician, not me, as an administrator, is solely responsible \\\\nfor the liability of every patient they care for.\\\\n    Meanwhile, they, alongside our administrative team, are \\\\nalso responsible for the nearly 600 professional team members \\\\nthey employ to make right business decisions taking into \\\\nconsideration the complex health care regulatory environment we \\\\nlive in today, as doing so ensures a future will exist for them \\\\nand our patients for generations to come under this model.\\\\n    I am here today to help you understand the challenges of \\\\nmaintaining this environment, and why so many private practices \\\\nacross the country are collapsing. There are three main \\\\nchallenges facing independent medicine in our market across the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    Number one--and I think you know what I am going to say--\\\\nthe source of revenue to maintain this environment is fixed, \\\\ndecreasing, and largely not in our control. A typical Medicare \\\\npatient 3 years ago reimbursed the practice $89.05. Today it \\\\nreimburses $2.59 less, and we face more cuts next year. This \\\\nmust change. No entity can stay in business with reductions \\\\nlike this, especially when the inflation rate over those 3 \\\\nyears was 16 percent. Physicians can no longer subsidize the \\\\ncost of care for the Federal Government, nor should they be \\\\nrequired to do so.\\\\n    Number two, expenses have increased dramatically. And I \\\\nwill give you one example, but there are many more: 3 years ago \\\\nan entry-level certified medical assistant hourly rate was \\\\n$13.50 an hour; today it is 16.50. This represents an annual \\\\nincrease of over $200,000 to our organization for just one \\\\nposition needed to care for patients. While giving pay \\\\nincreases is something we are very proud to do and good for our \\\\nteam members, increasing expenses without the ability to \\\\nincrease our fee for services puts us at a disadvantage to \\\\nother non-health care employers in the market.\\\\n    And number three, relationship with insurance carriers and \\\\nothers has become at times hostile and not conducive to \\\\nmaintaining a healthy balance required for the delivery of \\\\nhealth care today. Simply put, if any health care relationship \\\\nremains unbalanced, as it is in many of our communities, it \\\\nwill severely limit patient choices, drive up costs, and \\\\nundermine the integrity of patient care. Patients may even lose \\\\ntheir ability to see their doctor.\\\\n    I noted earlier that we have been in practice for over 75 \\\\nyears, longer than most insurance carriers have been in \\\\nexistence. Believe it or not, we didn&#x27;t always have health \\\\ninsurance, but we did have doctors. As an independent physician \\\\ngroup we have taken pride in caring for our neighbors and \\\\nfriends, not allowing for shortcuts in care, and making sure \\\\nthat a return on investment is not the determining factor in \\\\nphysicians&#x27; decision-making. And the results bear this out, as \\\\nwe are consistently offering innovative, cost-effective \\\\nsolutions while being recognized for the best care in the \\\\nregion, and we have the patient outcomes to prove this.\\\\n    Thank you for providing this forum to learn, and for \\\\ninviting me to speak to you directly. I am very happy to take \\\\nyour questions. Thank you.\\\\n    [The statement of Ms. Kean follows:]\\\\n    GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Desai.\\\\n\\\\n STATEMENT OF SEEMAL DESAI, MD, FOUNDER, INNOVATIVE DERMATOLOGY\\\\n\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Doggett, and \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, my name is Dr. Seemal R. Desai. I \\\\nam the president of the American Academy of Dermatology \\\\nAssociation that represents more than 17,000 physicians \\\\nnationwide, and I am the founder of Innovative Dermatology, a \\\\nprivate practice with 2 locations in Dallas.\\\\n    I see firsthand the lifesaving work that dermatologists \\\\nprovide for patients, which is especially timely today, during \\\\nNational Skin Cancer Awareness Month, when we are raising \\\\nawareness of statistics such as the fact that one person dies \\\\nevery hour from melanoma.\\\\n    I have seen how skin disease can devastate a family. At a \\\\nyoung age my brother was diagnosed with vitiligo, a devastating \\\\nskin disease that causes one to lose their own skin color, \\\\nresulting in large white patches all over the body, a disease \\\\nwhich can feel like a death sentence, especially for patients \\\\nwith skin of color, often leaving patients feeling anxious, \\\\ndepressed, and withdrawn. At the time of my brother&#x27;s \\\\ndiagnosis, my family would make a 450-mile journey from our \\\\nhome in Atlanta to see the only vitiligo specialist in this \\\\ncountry. I saw how critical it was to be able to have access to \\\\na high-quality specialist, particularly for a disease which \\\\nsuch profound psychological impact. And witnessing my family&#x27;s \\\\npatient experience, along with watching my recently-departed \\\\nlate father, a dentist, inspired me to go into medicine.\\\\n    Now, I am proud that I achieved my dream of opening my own \\\\nprivate practice in 2011. The threats facing small practices \\\\nhave grown immensely over the last decade, and the end is \\\\nnowhere in sight. I started my career with great optimism, but \\\\nthe continual state of medicine in this country has continually \\\\ndirectly affected my practice. As president of the Academy, \\\\nthis makes me incredibly concerned about the physicians I \\\\nrepresent and, most importantly, the patients we treat.\\\\n    The greatest challenge facing practices and patients is the \\\\nfailure of the Medicare physician fee schedule to keep up with \\\\ninflation, especially when physicians are the only Medicare \\\\nproviders that do not receive any inflationary updates. Since \\\\n2001 the cost of operating a medical practice has increased \\\\nalmost 50 percent--to be precise, 47 percent. And when adjusted \\\\nfor inflation, Medicare physician reimbursement rates declined \\\\nby 30 percent from 2001 to 2024. What business can survive \\\\nunder these circumstances?\\\\n    This payment structure disproportionately threatens the \\\\nviability of all medical practices, as well as those serving \\\\nrural, low-income, and underserved communities. This issue is \\\\nfurther exacerbated by rising costs and inflation, ultimately \\\\nleading to less health care options for patients.\\\\n    Congress must adopt a permanent Medicare payment update \\\\nthat fully acknowledges the inflationary growth of health care \\\\ncosts while working towards long-term reform. The Academy urges \\\\nCongress to establish a positive annual inflation adjustment, \\\\nand to increase the budget neutrality threshold by passing H.R. \\\\n2474 and 6371.\\\\n    Since I began practicing, I have increasingly had to grow \\\\nmy patient volume to keep up with demand while simultaneously \\\\njuggling skyrocketing overhead costs. In 2014 I brought on \\\\nanother board-certified dermatologist to reduce wait times and \\\\nincrease critical access for patients suffering from deadly \\\\nskin cancers like melanoma and a whole host of other skin \\\\nconditions. Keeping up with those increasing overhead expenses \\\\nand paying salaries of another physician, a part-time physician \\\\nassistant, and multiple medical assistants was costly and \\\\nbecame unsustainable.\\\\n    To continue serving my patients in the best way, I made a \\\\ndecision to combine part of my practice with a larger group to \\\\nhelp manage human resource burdens, the vicious cycle of \\\\nbilling and insurance issues, and to help make sure my clinic \\\\nwould continue to function, and frankly, because, as a solo \\\\ndoctor, I was burning out. Fortunately, I maintain full \\\\nclinical autonomy in a patient-centric model, providing timely \\\\nand essential access to care.\\\\n    Another challenge that I encounter multiple times every day \\\\nwhen I see patients is the incredible amount of resources we \\\\nspend on prior authorizations, on medications that will keep \\\\npatients out of the hospital. This includes staffing a \\\\ndedicated, full-time employee simply to handle prior \\\\nauthorizations.\\\\n    In closing, on behalf of our members and the patients I \\\\nrepresent as the president of the American Academy of \\\\nDermatology Association, thank you for giving me the honor to \\\\ntestify in front of you today. We stand ready to help the \\\\ncommittee as you confront the challenges facing practices and \\\\nhealth care in this country, and I look forward to your \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    [The statement of Dr. Desai follows:]\\\\n    GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Jha.\\\\n\\\\n   STATEMENT OF ASHISH JHA, MD, DEAN, BROWN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC \\\\n                             HEALTH\\\\n\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Good morning, Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member \\\\nDoggett, and members of the subcommittee. It really is an honor \\\\nto be here.\\\\n    I have practiced medicine for over 20 years, and in that \\\\ntime I have seen American medicine change. I have also seen so \\\\nmany colleagues and friends leave private independent practice.\\\\n    Now, when I was a kid growing up in India, I would follow \\\\nmy uncle, who was a physician, who made house calls. He mostly \\\\nmade house calls. He got paid whatever the patient gave him. \\\\nSometimes he didn&#x27;t get paid at all. But he made an enormous \\\\ndifference in people&#x27;s lives, and inspired me to become a \\\\ndoctor. During those years a doctor could keep in his or her \\\\nhead everything they needed to know to care for people. Today a \\\\nprimary care physician caring for a complex, sick population \\\\nmust coordinate care across dozens of specialists, manage a \\\\ndizzying array of medicines, tests, and procedures.\\\\n    Providing care in an independent, small practice has gotten \\\\nharder, to be sure. But on top of that, there is an array of \\\\nforces driving the demise of independent practices.\\\\n    Let&#x27;s start with hospitals and health systems. They have \\\\nbeen on a buying spree. Some of these purchases likely have \\\\nbeen helpful, maybe closely aligning hospitals and physicians \\\\nto provide high-quality care, but many have not. We have all \\\\nseen stories about how a hospital buys a practice. Nothing \\\\nchanges, but because it is now billed as delivered in a \\\\nhospital-based location, the cost to the patient goes up due to \\\\nfacility fees. The access isn&#x27;t any better, the quality isn&#x27;t \\\\nany better, but these fees make private practices an \\\\nacquisition target, and cost Medicare and consumers real money.\\\\n    Large corporations have gotten into this game, the most \\\\nwell-known of which is Optum, a part of the UnitedHealth Group. \\\\nOptum now owns or manages 1 in 10 practicing physicians in \\\\nAmerica.\\\\n    And then there is Medicare Advantage. The commercial \\\\ntakeover of Medicare has made life much more complicated for \\\\nthat independent physician. While payments that doctors receive \\\\nunder MA usually don&#x27;t match what they receive under regular \\\\ncommercial contracts, they face all the same hurdles and then \\\\nsome. The most obvious example you have heard about today is \\\\nprior authorization. Most MA plans require prior authorization. \\\\nEvery MA plan has its own set of rules, and prior authorization \\\\nmakes doctors&#x27; lives harder and hampers their ability to \\\\nprovide the care they think their patients need.\\\\n    Further, initial denials of care authorization have grown \\\\nsubstantially in recent years.\\\\n    And finally, last but certainly not least, there is private \\\\nequity. Recently a colleague of mine in Florida sold his small \\\\ncardiology practice to a private equity firm. Although he was \\\\ninitially reluctant to sell that practice he had run for over \\\\n20 years, he was persuaded by what seemed like a great price. \\\\nOver time he got pressured to change his documentation so they \\\\ncould bill more aggressively, and eventually he found himself \\\\nchanging the way he practiced medicine. And last, but not \\\\nleast, he heard from some of his longstanding patients that his \\\\npractice had stopped taking their insurance, meaning he could \\\\nno longer take care of them.\\\\n    My colleague is not alone. PE firms are spending hundreds \\\\nof billions of dollars buying up physicians, practices, \\\\nhospitals, and nursing homes across America. These acquisitions \\\\nusually increase costs. They can reduce access. They can even \\\\nharm patient safety.\\\\n    So thankfully, there is action, action we can take, and you \\\\nhave heard about many of these today.\\\\n    First, I think congressional action on site-neutral \\\\npayments is essential. It just makes no sense to pay more for \\\\nthe same care in the same location, just because the ownership \\\\nof that practice has changed.\\\\n    I believe transparency around ownership is essential, so we \\\\nknow who is buying up practices and what they are doing with \\\\nthose practices.\\\\n    And vigorous enforcement of our existing antitrust laws is \\\\ncritical to ensure that we reduce market consolidation.\\\\n    And finally--and you have heard this from my colleagues \\\\ntoday--it really is time to address the fact that there is no \\\\ninflation adjustment with the physician fee schedule. That just \\\\nmakes no sense. Physician pay should absolutely keep up with \\\\ninflation, and we have got to make that a real priority.\\\\n    My belief is, if we do all of these things, we can have a \\\\ndynamic health care system where independent practices can \\\\nthrive and flourish, and patients can have more choices, lower \\\\ncosts, and better care.\\\\n    Thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    [The statement of Dr. Jha follows:]\\\\n    GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. I thank all of you. We are going to move \\\\ninto the questioning session part of it.\\\\n    But if you can be somewhat concise, I know there is--these \\\\nare not simple, but Dr. Gholson, let me ask you. You are \\\\ntalking about your practice, 20 years. You had to unfortunately \\\\nclose the business. If you look back, what--could you have done \\\\nanything different?\\\\n    Or a lot of the rural communities that you are in, that you \\\\nservice, the numbers don&#x27;t add up, especially with--you know, \\\\nwhether--you are getting cut many times every year over the \\\\nyears. What are your thoughts on that?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. In my community one of the biggest barriers I \\\\nbelieve I had was that the local hospital considered me as \\\\ncompetition, instead of a community partner, and so they \\\\ncontinued to expand around me.\\\\n    And so there were often times where, say, my patients would \\\\ngo to their emergency room, and be admitted, and they would not \\\\nlist me as the primary care physician because I wasn&#x27;t employed \\\\nby the hospital. And then, when the hospital would discharge \\\\nthat patient, instead of sending them back to me as their \\\\nprimary care physician, they would send them back to one of \\\\ntheir hospital-employed physicians, which was disrupting the \\\\ncare. That was a major issue for me, because managing a \\\\ntransition from a hospital to your practice helps keep people \\\\nout of the hospital.\\\\n    It was also very difficult to contract with insurers \\\\nbecause I am--it is just me. I am the CEO, the CFO, the COO. I \\\\nmean, I do all of that. And so, you know, often they would say, \\\\n``We don&#x27;t know if we need you in our network,&#x27;&#x27; and I am like, \\\\nI am the only doctor in this town. How could you not need me? \\\\n[Laughter.]\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. So I think that was--those were probably the \\\\ntwo biggest challenges, is not being able to be competitive \\\\nwith contracting.\\\\n    I mean, what we get paid for primary care, it is just--it \\\\nis prices, the price of goods increases.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you. I have got to move along----\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. Sure.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN [continuing]. Because I want every--Dr. \\\\nRichardson, you talked about administrative burden has gotten a \\\\nlot worse. Can you better--a little bit more--articulate that \\\\naspect?\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Sure. Most of it--well, I shouldn&#x27;t say \\\\nmost of it. A lot of it revolves around MIPS. I have three \\\\nstaff that are constantly reporting following up--towards the \\\\nend of the year I had a conversation with our director of \\\\noperations and said, ``How much time do you spend reporting and \\\\ndealing with MIPS?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    She said, ``Towards the last two months of the year, it is \\\\nat least half of my day. Our head IT, it is at least half of \\\\nhis day. Our head nurse managers, at least half of her day, and \\\\nthroughout the year it is a never-ending game.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Sure, the costs of practice are going up every year, so you \\\\nhave to keep adding in administration for that, decreasing \\\\nreimbursement. So we are constantly pressured to try to add new \\\\nservice lines of treatment for the patients to try to maintain \\\\nrevenue. But at the end of the day, it is just the increased \\\\ncost, the increased need to try to employ more staff, and the \\\\ncompetition to try to employ those staff with competing \\\\nhospitals in town that can pay those staff more.\\\\n    But MIPS, especially towards the end of the year, is a huge \\\\nburden for my office staff.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Kean, what is your--you got a unique \\\\nperspective. You know, like she said, everybody is the CEO, and \\\\nthe CEO of their own practice. But what is your sense that is \\\\nthe biggest challenge, the top one or two challenges that you \\\\nface every day or every week in your practice or your business?\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Yes. I think, you know, aside from the payment \\\\nissues, it--certainly, prior authorization has been just an \\\\nabsolute disaster. And it really isn&#x27;t--it doesn&#x27;t do anything \\\\nto improve care. It does absolutely nothing to improve care. \\\\nBut it does allow insurance carriers to deny care. And if they \\\\ndon&#x27;t deny it on the first prior auth attempt, you know, \\\\ndoctors will get on the phone, spend all kinds of time with the \\\\ninsurance carriers getting it approved.\\\\n    We examined over 30,000 orders in our practice in 1 year. \\\\nWe have a research entity that helps us do that. And more \\\\nthan--less than one percent of the authorizations that we \\\\nrequested ever fully got denied, and I think that that is just \\\\nbecause the patient abandoned the care. So if they are \\\\napproving it 100 percent of the time, why are they doing it? It \\\\nis because it is a billing game. Because if you don&#x27;t have the \\\\nprior auth on the bill, which you will, then they can deny the \\\\ncare later that you already performed.\\\\n    And so I think prior authorization is a really big thing \\\\nthat we have tried to address in Texas. We do have a gold card \\\\nbill there, which we are very proud to support. It is a good \\\\nstart, but we need help with that. It only protects the fully-\\\\nfunded plans.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Okay. Let me ask both of you about \\\\nprivate equity. You touched on it. Here is the thing--I see it. \\\\nEverybody is getting paid less, but yet private equities--I \\\\nhave been in, you know, through the 1980s, with the junk bond \\\\ndeals, and leverage, and all the other stuff, they are usually \\\\nlooking to make 20 to 25 percent.\\\\n    So one side you have got, you know, where people aren&#x27;t \\\\ngetting paid enough, but yet they are buying these practices, \\\\nand it is working for them. And I am sure in five to seven \\\\nyears they are looking to get that kind of return. And I have \\\\nheard a lot of horror stories on some of it, where doctors \\\\nthought it was one thing and it ends up being another, they got \\\\nout of it.\\\\n    But both of you, I would just like to have you quickly \\\\nweigh in on that issue of private equity.\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for the \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    I think one of the things that I use as a litmus test when \\\\nlooking at patient care models, be that solo private practice, \\\\nbe that a group, be that a hospital system, multi-specialty, \\\\nprivate equity, invested, I think the important north star that \\\\nwe have to consider is where patient care lands between the \\\\nsanctity of the physician and the patient. And my philosophy \\\\nand the Academy&#x27;s position is that we want to ensure the \\\\nhighest level of patient care when a patient sees a board-\\\\ncertified dermatologist for their melanoma, to save their life \\\\nfrom skin cancer, or a horrible inflammatory skin disease.\\\\n    I think we have to be very careful when evaluating models \\\\nbecause it is not a one-size-fits-all approach, as you alluded \\\\nto in your comments, Mr. Chairman. So I think the important \\\\nmessage here is that we have to make sure we understand what is \\\\nhappening between the doctor and the patient in that exam room, \\\\nand how is that patient accessing the treatment in the best \\\\nway.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Private equity, Doctor?\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Chairman Buchanan, so this is a really important \\\\nissue. And it is, first of all, even hard to know how much \\\\nprivate equity is in health care, because there is no real \\\\ntransparency. But they have figured out how to make a buck in \\\\nthe system.\\\\n    Their general strategies tend to be they buy up a lot of \\\\npractices in a market, gain a lot of market power, and then go \\\\nto the insurers and say, ``We now own all of these practices. \\\\nWhat are you going to do? How do you run a network without \\\\nus?&#x27;&#x27; And they jack up prices. Ultimately, guess who pays that? \\\\nConsumers, employers. Guess who doesn&#x27;t get to see any of that? \\\\nThe physician who is in those practices. So that is their \\\\nnumber-one strategy for how they are doing it.\\\\n    They are doing a whole bunch of other things, changing the \\\\nway they do billing. This colleague of mine I mentioned who \\\\nsold his practice initially thinking, well, I can just practice \\\\nmedicine and not worry about the business, he found himself \\\\npracticing medicine differently because of the pressure he was \\\\ngetting.\\\\n    So private equity is a real problem. I think we need to \\\\nbegin with transparency. We need to know what these guys--who \\\\nthey are, what is--what the investments are. We need to have \\\\nvigorous antitrust enforcement so that you don&#x27;t gain monopoly \\\\nmarket power. And I think there is a series of other things we \\\\ncan do, but we have got to get on this.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. And let me just say, you know, kind of \\\\nclose to home for me, my nephew graduated as a doctor, a \\\\nradiologist, wanted to take a job in Florida, interviewed, all \\\\nthat. And then he found out that they were selling out to a, \\\\nyou know, a private equity firm. So he decided to look other \\\\nways, and he went out of state to find another opportunity. He \\\\njoins that firm, is with it now, and then within six months \\\\nthat equity firm bought that one out. So I know there is a lot \\\\nof discussion about that, but I am just concerned about where \\\\nall that is going, and the impact that has.\\\\n    And with that I will turn it over to Mr. Doggett.\\\\n    Mr. DOGGETT. Well, thank you very much. I would just \\\\ncontinue on that subject.\\\\n    One study I have seen found that private equity-owned \\\\nmedical practices charge 20 percent more, on average, per \\\\ninsurance claim than independent practices, and that an \\\\nestimated 80 percent of private equity-owned physician \\\\npractices significantly increased prices just after the \\\\ntakeover. I think the estimates I have seen are that, over the \\\\nlast decade, private equity has invested more than $1 trillion \\\\nin health care.\\\\n    You have given the example there in Florida, but overall--\\\\nsimilar studies have also shown a number of physicians exiting \\\\nfrom the practice after the private equity takeover. Overall, \\\\nis it fair to say that private equity&#x27;s role, with reference to \\\\nphysician practices, is to increase prices to both insurers and \\\\nto the Medicare system, and to decrease the quality of care?\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes, Ranking Member Doggett, that is a--it is a \\\\nreally important question. And here is where I think the \\\\nevidence is.\\\\n    I think, first of all, you have cited the key studies on \\\\nthis. There is a way that private equity firms do this. They \\\\nfirst make sure that people are billing kind of as aggressively \\\\nas possible. Second, as I said, they start getting market \\\\npower. And, you know, we all--I think all of us agree \\\\nphysicians need to be reimbursed more. That is not what private \\\\nequity is doing. They are getting higher reimbursements, but \\\\nthey are pocketing that difference. Physicians are not better \\\\noff.\\\\n    And so what we are seeing is, as you said, a lot of \\\\nphysicians who are just deciding they don&#x27;t want to practice in \\\\nthat kind of environment anymore, and leaving those practices.\\\\n    And then there are studies like one that came out about six \\\\nmonths ago that showed that, when private equity took over \\\\nhospitals, over the next two years medical errors, adverse \\\\nevents went up. And if you say, well, what happened there? My \\\\nbest guess is, you know, that they probably cut back on \\\\nstaffing in that hospital. That is another way to save money. \\\\nBut we know staffing can make a real difference in terms of \\\\npatient safety.\\\\n    So ultimately, what we need to do is we need to look at \\\\nbehavior. When there is bad behavior, we need to have clear \\\\npolicies and approaches to dealing with that bad behavior. I \\\\ndon&#x27;t want to paint too broad a brush stroke. I am sure there \\\\nare private equity acquisitions that have probably been fine. \\\\nBut overall, when you look at the overall system and see where \\\\npeople are going, it is causing increased costs for consumers \\\\nand the taxpayer. Doctors are worse off. Patients are worse \\\\noff.\\\\n    Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Now, Dr. Gholson, you really seem to be exhibit A for what \\\\nis wrong with the system now. You heard Dr. Jha also reference \\\\nthe need for vigorous antitrust enforcement.\\\\n    I know one of the things that the FTC has recently done \\\\nthat sparked some controversy relates to these non-compete \\\\nclauses that seem to have a big impact within the health care \\\\nsystem. How with the FTC&#x27;s recent action on that and other \\\\nenforcement, which has been lax for years, what impact do you \\\\nthink that will have?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. I think it will have a positive impact. At the \\\\nheart of the issue is the relationship between a physician and \\\\ntheir patient, and there should be nothing that comes in \\\\nbetween that. And currently, with non-compete clauses, it does.\\\\n    For instance, when I was considering selling my practice, I \\\\nconsidered going to work for the hospital, but I would have \\\\nbeen under a non-compete. And due to the expanse of where they \\\\nhad practices and outlying hospitals, if I were to break that \\\\nnon-compete, I think I would be 80 miles away from where I \\\\nlive, and I would have had to uproot my family. So it just was \\\\nnot an option.\\\\n    One of the things that does concern me with the FTC ruling \\\\nis that it doesn&#x27;t include non-profits, and we do have \\\\nhospitals that are--that would fall under that purview as a \\\\nnon-profit. So I would urge that that be considered, that non-\\\\nprofits should come under that ruling, as well.\\\\n    Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you very much, and for your testimony, \\\\ngenerally.\\\\n    Dr. Jha, let me also ask you about Medicare Advantage. I \\\\nhave seen estimates that we are paying about $1,500 per \\\\nMedicare recipient more, per year out of the Medicare trust \\\\nfund to MA plans, than on traditional Medicare. And yet these \\\\nplans, some of them, won&#x27;t pay the health care provider as much \\\\nas traditional Medicare. Could you just comment about any \\\\nrecommendations you might have for what we can do about it?\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes. So Congressman Doggett, as you alluded to, \\\\nMedicare Advantage has just taken off. It is now a majority of \\\\nMedicare patients are in Medicare Advantage. This is really a \\\\nphenomena of the last 10 years. If you ask the question why, it \\\\nis because we are overpaying for Medicare and--Medicare \\\\nAdvantage. And that is not, again, translating into better care \\\\nfor patients or better reimbursement for physicians.\\\\n    There is a series of policy things--risk adjustment, how \\\\nyou do regional, benchmarking--a series of policy options that \\\\nwe have, but we have got to implement them. Just paying more to \\\\ninsurance companies when they are not generating more value for \\\\nconsumers, patients, or taxpayers doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense.\\\\n    Mr. DOGGETT. Thanks to all of you.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Smith.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you to our panel, as well, sharing your perspective. \\\\nThank you for being on the front lines of health care, where I \\\\nknow it is challenging and it hasn&#x27;t been getting any easier \\\\nfor various reasons.\\\\n    I am concerned that, instead of finding true reforms, we \\\\nhave just seen over the last few years we just shift around who \\\\ngets paid, how much, and then there are more regulations, and \\\\nthen there are responses to that. And ultimately, patients \\\\naren&#x27;t any better off with more government intrusion and \\\\ninvolvement.\\\\n    But it is very interesting to hear, Dr. Gholson, your \\\\nexperience, your perspective, that you found the competition to \\\\nbe the local hospital, who wouldn&#x27;t refer to you. Would that be \\\\naccurate?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. [Nonverbal response.]\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. And that perhaps the full choices to \\\\npatients were not disclosed to the patient. That is--I am \\\\ntroubled by that, and especially in the broader picture of how \\\\nwe oftentimes hear about how referral, the referral process, \\\\nshould or should not be in other respects.\\\\n    But, you know, when we have these changes in ownership of \\\\npractices, it is disruptive, obviously, as was touched on, that \\\\ninsurance plans may not be accepted anymore, and how disruptive \\\\nthat is, ultimately, to patients, and especially those in more \\\\nrural areas. When I represent one of the most rural districts \\\\nin America, this can be very disruptive. There aren&#x27;t that many \\\\nchoices. Mere access is our goal sometimes, when in more urban \\\\nareas it is--you know, there might be more choices among \\\\nproviders. But to take away even some of that very basic \\\\naccess, I think, is troubling.\\\\n    I will also point to the regulations and requirements that \\\\noftentimes originate here in Washington being a huge problem, \\\\nand I think the latest is the new staffing mandate for nursing \\\\nhomes. So just in Nebraska--we are a pretty rural state--just \\\\nin Nebraska, the Biden Administration expects us to come up \\\\nwith 450 new nursing FTEs. Where will they come from? Will they \\\\ncome from the hospitals and the practices that you mention--\\\\nwhich, I am guessing, you might already face a shortage in \\\\ntheir support staff or, you know, nursing providers. I find \\\\nthis unconscionable, that they would even think of this. And we \\\\nhave nursing homes in rural America already struggling without \\\\nthe new mandates. And I think we all know what the mandates are \\\\nreally about, but it is very unfortunate that these poorly \\\\nthought-out policies tend to be happening so much these days.\\\\n    Dr. Gholson, though, could you perhaps elaborate more on, \\\\nyou know, the recommendations or insights that you think we \\\\nshould pursue to address the workforce shortages, whether it is \\\\nMDs, whether it is other providers that--you know, that full \\\\nspectrum there, what can we do to bring some relief to the \\\\nshortages?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. So in Mississippi one of the things we have \\\\ndone is increased the number of residencies, family medicine \\\\nresidencies in Mississippi, with the belief that where people \\\\ntrain they will stay. And so I would encourage--more GME \\\\nfunding would be one thing that you could do to help increase \\\\nrural physicians.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. What did they do in Mississippi to \\\\nincrease those slots?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. So we established the Office of Mississippi \\\\nPhysician Workforce, and our state legislature appropriates \\\\nfunding every year to assist with the start-up cost for \\\\nresidency, because that seems to be the biggest issue for \\\\nstarting new residencies, is that initial start-up cost.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Do you ever find that there could be \\\\nsome stakeholders who want to participate in creating more \\\\nslots, rather than just waiting for the Federal Government to \\\\nput more money into those?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. Yes. A lot of the hospitals, when they are \\\\nlooking at supporting the Graduate Medical Education, they will \\\\noften put up some of their own funds because they see the \\\\neconomic impact down the line.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. But there would not be something at \\\\nthe Federal level that would stand in the way of their wishing \\\\nto do that. Would that be accurate?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. The only thing I see is that sometimes there \\\\nis a cap on payments at the Federal level that should probably \\\\nbe looked at for GME funding.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Okay, all right.\\\\n    Thank you, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Sewell.\\\\n    Ms. SEWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank \\\\nour witnesses.\\\\n    Supporting our nation&#x27;s physicians is pivotal to reducing \\\\nnegative health outcomes. Dr. Gholson, I represent Alabama, \\\\nnext door to Mississippi. And I think one of the reasons why I \\\\nam so passionate about making sure we increase the number of \\\\nslots, the GME slots--and I want to thank our colleague, \\\\nRepresentative Fitzpatrick, and I for working so hard to try to \\\\nincrease the number of slots. We promote a bill, the Resident \\\\nPhysician Shortage Reduction Act, and we have tried to increase \\\\nas many as we can in order to increase the workforce. The \\\\nbelief is that, as you said, if they do a residency in these \\\\nsmaller rural communities, hopefully they will stay.\\\\n    My district, Alabama&#x27;s 7th congressional district, is both \\\\nurban and rural. And like you, I have many independent \\\\nphysicians that are struggling. In fact, one is Dr. Steve Furr. \\\\nDr. Furr is a practicing rural family physician in my district \\\\nfrom Clarke County, Alabama. Not only does Dr. Furr practice at \\\\nthe Family Medical Clinic of Jackson, Alabama, but he also \\\\nserves as the national president for the American Academy of \\\\nFamily Physicians. Dr. Furr, like many family physicians, has \\\\nserved in his community as an independent physician for 25 \\\\nyears without an inflationary update in 10 years. Yet, of \\\\ncourse, all of his medical equipment has--costs have increased. \\\\nAnd after COVID, obviously, the price of having good nursing \\\\nsupport staff has increased, as well.\\\\n    We should be doing everything we can to ensure that \\\\nindependent physicians have enough capital to sustain their \\\\npractices without having to resort to consolidation with large \\\\nhealth systems, which is why I am also a very proud cosponsor \\\\nof H.R. 2474, which is the Strengthening Medicare for Patients \\\\nand Providers Act. It has strong bipartisan support. I think it \\\\nis the right thing to do for our nation&#x27;s physicians. This bill \\\\nwould provide physicians with the inflationary increase that \\\\nthey need by changing the Medicare payment rate to reflect the \\\\nMedical economic index for inflation. This would help providers \\\\nlike Dr. Furr and other independent physicians.\\\\n    I think it is really important that we do whatever we can \\\\nto level the playing field so that independent physicians have \\\\njust as much of a chance as these big, private equity firms. \\\\nAnd I am committed to trying to do everything I can to see that \\\\nthrough. I know our whole committee is.\\\\n    Dr. Jha, thank you for sharing your expertise in today&#x27;s \\\\nhearing. How can we best support independent physicians in \\\\nrural and underserved communities that do not desire to be \\\\nconsolidated with larger systems and larger practices?\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes, thank you, Congresswoman, and you actually \\\\nlaid out a lot of the issues. And I think our--my colleagues \\\\nhave here, as well.\\\\n    I mean, first of all, I do think we really do need to look \\\\nat reimbursements for primary care more broadly. Nothing \\\\nagainst our specialist friends who are on the panel, but \\\\nprimary care reimbursement continues to be a serious problem \\\\nfor family practitioners, general internists, pediatricians. I \\\\nthink that is an area that requires more attention. I think \\\\nthat would be helpful to all primary care physicians, certainly \\\\nin rural areas.\\\\n    There is no question about it in my mind that--you know, if \\\\nyou think it is hard practicing in a world where a majority of \\\\nyour Medicare patients are MA in an urban setting, it is \\\\nincredibly hard in a rural setting. You don&#x27;t have the ability \\\\nto have a full-time person just managing prior authorization.\\\\n    Ms. SEWELL. Yes.\\\\n    Dr. JHA. That is untenable. So some of the policy issues \\\\nthat I have talked about with MA, you know, with site-neutral \\\\npayments, those are all going to be helpful everywhere, but \\\\nparticularly for the rural provider who is just much more \\\\nvulnerable to these kinds of things.\\\\n    Ms. SEWELL. Absolutely. Dr. Gholson, can you talk a little \\\\nbit about your experience, and what recommendations you would \\\\ngive this committee in order to help support independent \\\\nphysicians?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. Well, I agree with my colleague. Paying \\\\nprimary care is vital to the--being able to sustain primary \\\\ncare independent practices in rural America.\\\\n    And the budget neutrality issue is also something I think \\\\nthat needs to be looked at. I love my colleagues. I don&#x27;t want \\\\nthem undervalued because I feel like I need to be valued more.\\\\n    We have talked about prior authorizations, the \\\\nadministrative burden. That is key.\\\\n    It is just really paying us for the work that we do, and \\\\nthe value that we bring not only to our patients, but we bring \\\\nvalue to our communities.\\\\n    Ms. SEWELL. Absolutely. And often times you are in \\\\ncommunities where there is a medical desert. And so you also \\\\nprovide economic opportunity.\\\\n    Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Kelly.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for \\\\ntaking a day out of your life to be here today to try to \\\\nexplain your business model. You guys have so much non-\\\\nproductive labor, but everybody in business has that today.\\\\n    I am just going to take a couple of seconds to push a bill \\\\nthat we are going to be dropping on the 5th of June. It is the \\\\nImproving Seniors&#x27; Timely Access to Care Act. Ms. DelBene is on \\\\nthis, Dr. Bucshon is on this, Dr. Bera is on this.\\\\n    And at this point I want to take the time that I have \\\\nremaining and give it to my friend, Dr. Wenstrup, who is \\\\nactually in this business, and goes through what you go through \\\\nevery day.\\\\n    But I got to tell you, I wish I could say that there is \\\\nhelp on the way. I don&#x27;t know how anybody runs a profitable \\\\nbusiness anymore, especially anytime the government gets \\\\ninvolved in it.\\\\n    So at this point, Dr. Wenstrup, take it away.\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you, Mr. Kelly, I appreciate you \\\\nobliging me and giving me more time, and I will use my time \\\\nwhen it comes about, too.\\\\n    Before I get started, without objection, I would like to \\\\nenter a statement for the record on behalf of my friend, \\\\ncolleague, and fellow co-chair of the GOP Doctors Caucus, Dr. \\\\nMurphy. He is away. He is going to be undergoing surgery. I \\\\nwant you all to keep him in your prayers. And without \\\\nobjection, I would like to submit his statement for the record.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. So ordered.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Murphy follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. So obviously, everyone--everything you have \\\\nsaid is spot on. We have covered all the points. But our \\\\ncountry is facing a critical shortage, and access to quality \\\\ncare is definitely a problem.\\\\n    One thing I do want to say is that I hope that we don&#x27;t, as \\\\nthe medical professionals, reduce the level of expectations in \\\\nour education and training, as it will make it even more \\\\ndifficult to defend our value. We have got to do that. You \\\\nmentioned board certification. That is important in every one \\\\nof our specialties, because it represents ascertaining the \\\\nhighest level of quality care that you can provide. And I get \\\\nthat.\\\\n    You know, it is so hard to fathom what has happened to \\\\nmedicine because providers are the product. We are the product \\\\nand are the key to a healthy nation to begin with. And it \\\\njust--and we need a strong, uninterrupted doctor-patient \\\\nrelationship to exist.\\\\n    When I first started in practice, I set up my own practice. \\\\nI had two employees. And if someone was sick, my mom came in. \\\\nYou like that, don&#x27;t you, Dr. Gholson? And it was wonderful, it \\\\nwas wonderful. And as time changed, I joined a large orthopedic \\\\ngroup, but I still practiced as an independent physician, I \\\\nfelt it. You know, it was the type of practice where at \\\\nChristmas time people are bringing your gifts, you have \\\\ndeveloped relationships, and I think that is the key to a \\\\nsuccessful outcome.\\\\n    One of the reasons I ran for Congress is I looked at \\\\nWashington and I said we have people making health care \\\\ndecisions that have never seen a patient, have no idea what it \\\\nis like being out in the trenches. And the profession has \\\\nchanged a lot since I started that practice which I valued, but \\\\nit was no problem when I went to a larger group because we were \\\\nall of the same ilk. We were independent, we were practicing. \\\\nOur reputation mattered in the community. That is what \\\\nmattered, not what Washington thought. I have always felt it \\\\nreally didn&#x27;t matter to me. Yes, you know, if you want us to do \\\\nthis, submit this and that--which, obviously, as you know, and \\\\nas everyone has commented, got worse and worse and worse, and \\\\nmore and more burdensome.\\\\n    But I remember starting out in practice. And every day from \\\\nWashington I was hearing about greedy doctors, greedy doctors. \\\\nThis is the 1980s. And I thought I am $185,000 in debt. That is \\\\ncheap today, that is cheap today. And I worked during school to \\\\nkeep it down. I am not greedy. And I figured I will make a good \\\\nliving as long as I do a good job and take care of people. That \\\\nis all it comes down to.\\\\n    I am against fraud. We want to catch people that are \\\\ncommitting fraud and everything else. But other than that, get \\\\nout of our way. Let us take care of people.\\\\n    We get on calls for prior authorization, and I am talking \\\\nto somebody who is not in my specialty telling me what I can \\\\nand can&#x27;t do. I ask them for their license and how the patient \\\\ncan make an appointment for them, because if they are going to \\\\ntake over the care they should take over the liability. And I \\\\nam just sick of it. They take no liability, but they determine \\\\nthe outcome of the patient, they delay the treatment of the \\\\npatient. All of these things.\\\\n    We have got to take control, and we have got to start \\\\ntelling Washington, as providers and as Members of Congress, \\\\nenough is enough.\\\\n    My time has expired here, but I am just getting warmed up. \\\\n[Laughter.]\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Stay tuned for act two. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Chu.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Dr. Jha, thank you for your testimony. Every year, \\\\nespecially over the last few years, especially during the last \\\\nhalf of the year, physician group after physician group will \\\\ncome in pleading not to just get zero percent increase in their \\\\nMedicare fees. Current law has the updates at 2.93 percent for \\\\n2024, but it will drop to 0 percent for 2025 unless Congress \\\\nintervenes.\\\\n    So the physicians say the updates are insufficient, and \\\\nthat there is no means to deal with inflation. And of course, \\\\nthey talk about that, with this insufficient Medicare payment \\\\nupdates, it is really difficult to deal with their practices. \\\\nWe have heard a lot about these challenges today from so many \\\\nof you who have testified.\\\\n    What do you recommend we do to upgrade how Medicare pays \\\\nphysicians in a way that will improve value without breaking \\\\nthe bank?\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes, Congresswoman, thank you for that very \\\\nimportant question.\\\\n    I guess I would begin by saying that part of the reason \\\\nthey come in every year is because we have a long tradition of \\\\nnot fixing things for the long run, and then doing this kind of \\\\nBandAid fix every year. We did that for a year. \\\\nEventually, MACRA solved one part of that problem, but then now \\\\nwe have this issue.\\\\n    Look, I think we need a long-term fix on inflation \\\\nadjustment for our physician fee schedule. I just--I have not \\\\nencountered someone who does not think that that is the case. \\\\nWhere there is some disagreement is exactly how do we do that. \\\\nAnd do we use the Medicare economic index that tracks costs of \\\\npractice? What proportion of that over what time?\\\\n    I think MedPAC has laid out a strategy and an approach that \\\\nI think is pretty reasonable. I suspect other people may be--\\\\nyou know, may not disagree with their--I mean may not fully \\\\nagree with their approach.\\\\n    But the bottom line is that, instead of fixing this--you \\\\nhave plenty of other issues you need to be dealing with. Having \\\\nto do this every single year creates uncertainty, it wastes \\\\ntime, and it creates hardship. And for physician practices \\\\nplanning out next year, if they don&#x27;t know what they are going \\\\nto get paid, that makes them more susceptible to being--to \\\\nsaying, fine, I will just take the deal from the hospital or \\\\nthe private equity firm. So a long-term fix is what we need at \\\\nthis moment.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you for that. Dr. Jha, you also highlight \\\\nthe issue of frequent wrongful prior authorization denials in \\\\nMedicare Advantage plans. I am especially concerned that a \\\\ngrowing number of these denials are determined by flawed \\\\nalgorithms and unvetted AI tools that fail to account for \\\\nbeneficiaries&#x27; individual circumstances.\\\\n    In 2022 the Department of Health and Human Services \\\\ninspector general found that AI denials led to amputations, \\\\nfast-spreading cancers, and other devastating diagnoses for \\\\nsome seniors. In response to these AI denials, I sent a letter \\\\nto CMS last year detailing specific enforcement actions the \\\\nagency can take to increase oversight of AI tools in Medicare \\\\nAdvantage coverage decisions. And earlier this year I was \\\\npleased that CMS finalized new prior authorization rules \\\\ninstructing plans to make coverage decisions based on \\\\nindividual circumstances, as opposed to AI.\\\\n    But questions about the enforcement of these instructions \\\\nremain. So Dr. Jha, can you elaborate on how the rampant use of \\\\nunvetted AI tools by MA insurers creates unnecessary burdens \\\\nfor physicians, and contributes to harmful outcomes for \\\\npatients?\\\\n    And what additional measures should be taken to enforce \\\\nthese rules and ensure that private insurers are not leveraging \\\\nAI tools to unlawfully deny care for seniors on Medicare \\\\nAdvantage?\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes, and again, I think we have heard almost \\\\neverybody on this panel talk about prior authorization and its \\\\nproblems. I think there was a report out--I want to say it was \\\\nProPublica, but one of these news outlets--that looked at \\\\nCigna. Their denial--they spent a second-and-a-half per claim \\\\nto make their denials. This is not a physician carefully \\\\nreviewing the circumstances and making a clinical \\\\ndetermination.\\\\n    The way that most of these insurance companies work is, if \\\\nyou can use an algorithm, you deny first a whole set of things. \\\\nYou just have raised the bar for the physician to have to come \\\\nback, argue for the case. And a lot of physicians in a busy \\\\npractice will just give up. And that is actually the strategy.\\\\n    Look, I think there are instances where prior authorization \\\\ncan make sense. If you are doing something somewhat \\\\nexperimental, extraordinarily expensive, extremely unusual, \\\\ngoing through an extra burden or an extra hurdle can make \\\\nsense. But I think, for more routine things, a lot of what CMS \\\\nlaid out--I think it was in your letter, as well, \\\\nCongresswoman--is really smart. I think we have got to have \\\\nactual physicians involved in the decision-making, transparency \\\\nabout authorized pre-authorization rates and denial rates. \\\\nThere is a lot of work to be done.\\\\n    But again, what I would love to see is long-term fixes on \\\\nthese, because Medicare Advantage is here to stay, and we have \\\\ngot to make sure that we solve these problems for the long run.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Wenstrup. And we are going to move two to one now.\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    You know, one of the things I want to continue with what I \\\\nwas saying, when I said I didn&#x27;t care what Washington thought, \\\\nI didn&#x27;t want them to have to worry about what I was doing, \\\\neither, you know, at the same time. I cared about what the \\\\npatient&#x27;s results were, what they thought, what my referring \\\\ndoctor thought, what my hospital community thought, what my \\\\nfellows around me, my society thought, all those types of \\\\nthings. Because when you do that, you are going to be fine.\\\\n    But if you are doing something out of the extraordinary or \\\\nsomething inappropriate--Dr. Jha, you kind of touched on that--\\\\nI understand that. You know, let&#x27;s have some oversight here and \\\\nthere. Our society should have oversight over how people \\\\npractice. All those things are important.\\\\n    But I remember in my first term here with the Doctors \\\\nCaucus, we were meeting with CMS, and they said to us, ``All \\\\nthe things we are starting to implement are really starting to \\\\nwork.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I said, ``For who? For who?&#x27;&#x27; I said, ``You have taken the \\\\njoy out of taking care of people. You have made it such a \\\\nburden to actually put your hands on someone&#x27;s shoulder, and \\\\ntake care of them, and tell them you are going to be there for \\\\nthem, because you spent more of your time trying to appease \\\\nthey who never see the patient.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    You know, going forward, okay, what are we going to do \\\\ngoing forward? You know, at the GOP Doctors Caucus we talk \\\\nabout our focus on making America the healthiest nation on the \\\\nplanet. What are we doing? Is everything we are doing leading \\\\nto better health for all of America? And how do we incentivize \\\\nprevention, and how do we understand here in Washington the \\\\nreturn on investment when we actually have a cure for \\\\nsomething, and the cost of it pales in comparison to treating \\\\nsomeone for 25 years?\\\\n    Those are the types of things we need to work on here, and \\\\nmove forward as a nation so that we can do more for patients. \\\\nBecause there is a greater value to the healthy human being, \\\\nand even those with chronic illnesses if we can keep them \\\\nhealthy. Guess what? They can go to work. They can do things \\\\nand pay taxes, which is more money we can get our grubby little \\\\nhands on up here. And that is, you know--but the value of the \\\\nhealthy human being is never really considered. We have to keep \\\\npromoting this.\\\\n    I do want to spend time talking about something that I know \\\\nwill be near and dear to Dr. Gholson. Xavier University in \\\\nCincinnati, Ohio is starting a new DO school. Why are they \\\\nstarting DO? Because DOs tend to gravitate more towards primary \\\\ncare. And look, you know, the practice that I have as a \\\\npodiatric surgeon, you know, we are doing vascular, we are \\\\ndoing orthopedics, we are doing dermatology, we are doing a \\\\nlittle bit of everything--sports medicine. We do a lot of \\\\nprevention. We do a lot of prevention, try to prevent \\\\nulcerations, limb salvage, those types of things. So this is \\\\nnear and dear to my heart, that we focus on preventive care and \\\\nincentivize it.\\\\n    You know, the doctor that does the CABG, the open heart \\\\nsurgery, that is great. You save a life, you should be rewarded \\\\nfor that. That is tremendous. But the primary care doctor that \\\\nworks with the patient that prevents them from ever needing \\\\nthat CABG, you really don&#x27;t get rewarded for that. We need to \\\\nfocus on those types of things. That will be better for us as a \\\\nnation.\\\\n    So Xavier started the DO school because they tend to focus \\\\nmore towards primary care, which we need in southern Ohio \\\\ntremendously. At the end of the Trump Administration we did \\\\npass 1,000 new residencies with--a large focus should be going \\\\nto rural. So I am trying to coordinate residency programs in \\\\nour rural areas because, as you said, people stay. These are \\\\nsome of the solutions, though. These are the things we have to \\\\nfocus on.\\\\n    But I want to go back to the problem, and I really want my \\\\ncolleagues to focus on this. We need to take control.\\\\n    We passed the No Surprises Act in a bipartisan fashion to \\\\ntake anxiety away from patients who worry about--so they don&#x27;t \\\\nhave to worry about their bill, it will be taken care of \\\\nbetween the insurance provider and the doctor. We did it in a \\\\nway that we hoped would be fair to everyone, and where doctors \\\\nwould want to be in network, and insurance companies would want \\\\nyou in network. And HHS went and changed the bill to exactly \\\\nwhat we said we didn&#x27;t want. These are problems we have here. \\\\nBut we need your voice to keep talking about these things so \\\\nthat we can make the changes.\\\\n    And so, I don&#x27;t really have a question, but I want to go \\\\nback to that with Dr. Gholson and get your comments on that, \\\\nbecause I hope this is going to be a successful thing. And you \\\\nhave somewhat mimicked that with--I think it sounds like what \\\\nyou did at the state level by helping to get the residencies \\\\nunderway. Can you comment on that a little more?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. On the work that the OMPW has done?\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. Yes.\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. Yes. So we started that about 11 years ago \\\\nwith the idea that we needed to increase physicians in rural \\\\nareas. Specifically, we needed to increase well-trained family \\\\nmedicine physicians in rural areas because we felt like that \\\\nfamily physicians could take care of maternity needs, they \\\\ncould take care of pediatric needs, they could take care of \\\\npreventative visits. It was--seemed like the best solution to \\\\nhelp with our lack of medical care in rural areas.\\\\n    We too recently started a DO school in Mississippi. It is \\\\nrelatively young. I think they have graduated their second or \\\\nthird class, and it has been good to see their commitment to \\\\nprimary care in the state. But it is a pipeline. It doesn&#x27;t \\\\nhappen overnight.\\\\n    One of the things we also did is we started the Rural \\\\nMedical Scholarship Program. So we encouraged our medical \\\\nstudents at both the MD university and the DO university to \\\\nchoose to go into primary care, and so they were able to \\\\ngraduate medical school with no debt.\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you. My time is expired, but thank you \\\\nvery much.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Hern.\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. I greatly appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank \\\\nthe witnesses for being here today and, as my colleague from \\\\nPennsylvania said, taking some time out of your life to come \\\\ntalk to us about something that you do every single day.\\\\n    I will--as my colleagues up here have described, I want to \\\\ndescribe a health care system that I grew up in many years ago \\\\nin the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. I remember seeing the same \\\\ndoctor for every ailment I had, from the time my brother \\\\naccidentally shot me with a bow and arrow to the scar on my \\\\nface from a barbed wire fence to broken bones and even the \\\\ncommon cold. This was a time before there were third-party \\\\nbillers, electronic health records. If my mom couldn&#x27;t pay the \\\\nbill that day, which she usually couldn&#x27;t, she put it on the \\\\nledger. And when she got paid, she paid the doctor. And guess \\\\nwhat? That system worked. I am here today, and getting to talk \\\\nabout the very thing that I grew up in.\\\\n    It seems so simple, you know, a patient and a doctor \\\\ntogether were the heart of the health care system. But sadly, \\\\nwe are a long way from those days. Now we have third-party \\\\nbillers, huge health systems, and no one knows how much \\\\nanything actually costs.\\\\n    One thing that really concerns me that I am glad this \\\\nhearing highlights is the fact that the health care system will \\\\nbuy up a physician practice, jack up the prices--and sometimes \\\\novernight--and get paid much higher rates than private, \\\\nphysician-owned practices for the same exact services. A lot of \\\\ntimes this is because these hospital systems tack on a so-\\\\ncalled facility fee. Study after study after study shows that \\\\npatients are being charged exponentially more for the same \\\\nservices.\\\\n    According to an analysis of six outpatient procedures \\\\nreleased last fall, hospital common procedure prices were \\\\nsubstantially higher, in some cases five times higher than when \\\\nperformed at a physician&#x27;s office. There is no evidence that \\\\noutpatient care in hospital-owned facilities for the same \\\\nservices results in better outcomes. So patients are left with \\\\nno added benefits, just higher prices and less choices. This is \\\\nwhy I introduced H.R. 3417, the FAIR Act, which would require \\\\nall off-campus outpatient departments to have separate NPIs so \\\\nthey cannot change--charge onsite hospital prices.\\\\n    Dr. Richardson, you touched on this a bit in your \\\\ntestimony. Would you agree that requiring unique identifiers \\\\nfor on and off-campus facilities and other site-neutral \\\\npolicies would lead to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients?\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    Absolutely. We have a very comprehensive one-stop-shop \\\\npractice, where we offer radiation therapy, diagnostic therapy, \\\\nsurgical therapy, medication therapy, clinical trials--\\\\nbasically, treatments and diagnosis throughout the gamut. If we \\\\nsold to a hospital system overnight, by changing nothing, not \\\\nchanging the sign on the door, not changing the physicians, not \\\\nchanging location, overnight it would cost two to three times \\\\nmore for any of the insurance companies or Medicare, and the \\\\npatient&#x27;s out-of-pocket, as well.\\\\n    So it absolutely makes a big difference, when all of a \\\\nsudden you are billing under a hospital code instead of an \\\\noutpatient procedure code or an outpatient clinic code, that \\\\nthe price just skyrockets. And it has nothing to do with \\\\nquality of care. It has nothing to do with access of care. In \\\\nfact, most of the time it would actually decrease access, \\\\nbecause all of a sudden we are not motivated to work as much \\\\nbecause we are getting paid substantial rates on RVUs, because \\\\nthe hospital can&#x27;t afford to do it due to their site of service \\\\ndisparity and benefits and advantages in that realm.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Thank you. Another issue that I am gravely \\\\nconcerned about and interested in is this idea of physician-\\\\nowned hospitals.\\\\n    I know we all have our opinions on the Affordable Care Act, \\\\nand my opinion is there was a lot wrong with it, but today I \\\\nfocus on the ban on opening new, physician-owned hospitals. I \\\\nfound it a bit foolish that we have sat back and watched \\\\nhospitals and health care systems take over and buy physician \\\\npractices now employing upwards of 75 percent of our \\\\nphysicians, but do not let physicians, the ones providing the \\\\ncare, invest and run their own hospitals.\\\\n    Physician-owned hospitals have shown to provide equivalent \\\\nor higher quality care more efficiently and at a lower cost, \\\\ncompared to community hospitals, resulting in significantly \\\\nbetter patient experiences and outcomes. Ms. Kean, you noted \\\\nthe benefit patients see from going to an independently owned \\\\nhospital group. Do you think allowing physicians to own \\\\nhospitals would create more competition?\\\\n    And also, what type of benefits have you seen regarding \\\\npatient care when physicians own their own place of work?\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Yes, I know a lot about that. You know, as I \\\\nsaid, we are 100 percent physician-owned, as a practice here in \\\\nSan Antonio. We own two outpatient ambulatory surgery centers \\\\n100 percent, and we also manage them, and that is physician-\\\\nled.\\\\n    We do not own a hospital. We were not able to do that, \\\\nunfortunately. But we did partner with a hospital in San \\\\nAntonio to help us, you know, get control over the care that \\\\nthey are receiving in the hospital system.\\\\n    But yes, I don&#x27;t see a reason why a physician can&#x27;t own a \\\\nhospital. I understand that there is regulatory, you know, \\\\nrequirements as far as a referral relationship and where that \\\\npatient is going to go. But the physician actually knows where \\\\nthe best place is for the patient to receive care. And I think \\\\nwe just need to let them do that.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I do want to note that when I said I got shot \\\\nwith--by a bow and arrow from my brother, that they all kind of \\\\nsmiled like they have worked on people who had been shot by bow \\\\nand arrows before. [Laughter]\\\\n    Mr. HERN. So Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. By the way, I have got two brothers, so \\\\nI know----\\\\n    [Laughter.]\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. And three sisters. So I got--Mr. Davis, \\\\nyou are recognized.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank all \\\\nof the witnesses for very interesting insights and this \\\\ndiscussion.\\\\n    I have been thinking I have been around health care now, I \\\\nguess, for a pretty good period of time. I have worked in \\\\nclinics, I have sat on the board of hospitals. I have taught at \\\\nmedical schools. I hope that I can leave today with a feeling \\\\nthat, yes, we are all concerned about conserving the private \\\\npractice of medicine, the independent, private practice.\\\\n    I remember when I used to teach a course at the University \\\\nof Illinois School of Medicine, and we taught a course called \\\\nThe Realities of Medicine. As young medical students would come \\\\nin, they would talk about their goals and what they wanted to \\\\ndo. Of course, many of them would indicate that they wanted to \\\\ndo family medicine, family practice. They wanted to be \\\\ninternists. By the time they graduated, many of them would have \\\\nchanged their positions and changed their minds, and would \\\\ndecide that they needed to go into something that compensated \\\\nthem a little differently, that the reality was they may have \\\\nwanted to do one thing, but when it got down to deciding, they \\\\nwould find it necessary to decide that they want to do \\\\nsomething else.\\\\n    And I guess there is always this business of economy, the \\\\nbusiness of our economic system, and the business of where do \\\\nwe and how do we equalize or try and equalize systems so that \\\\nthe systems work together.\\\\n    I am a sociologist. I am a big fan of a fellow called \\\\nFrederick Douglass, who used to say that he knew one thing if \\\\nhe didn&#x27;t know anything else, and that is that in this world \\\\nyou may not get everything that you pay for, but you will \\\\ncertainly pay for everything that you get, and that you pay one \\\\nway or you would pay the other.\\\\n    I wonder if each one of us could give one thing you think \\\\nwe can really do that would help conserve and preserve the \\\\nindependent, private practice of medicine.\\\\n    I have been reading the papers, and I have read several \\\\nstories in the last weeks or two.\\\\n    So Dr. Gholson, why don&#x27;t you just start and go?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. It is tough to give you just one thing, so I \\\\nam kind of torn between get rid of prior authorizations \\\\nabsolutely, completely, and for--as primary care, paying us for \\\\nwhat we are worth.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Thank you. I think maybe one of the biggest \\\\nindicators or the biggest thing to keep us in business is just \\\\nupdating the physician fee schedule so we can actually keep \\\\npace with the cost of running a practice. Our overhead, \\\\nemployee overhead, has gone up 30 percent in the last 2 years. \\\\nOur medical insurance goes up 10 to 20 percent every year. We \\\\nliterally just can&#x27;t keep pace with it, and we can&#x27;t keep \\\\nhiring. So updating that fee schedule that keeps pace with that \\\\ncost would be beneficial.\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. I would like to get the medical record back in \\\\nthe hands of the physicians, instead of these AI tools and \\\\ninsurance carriers. It has become a billing weapon, and not the \\\\nmedical record that it used to be. I would like to see us get \\\\nthat back.\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Congressman Davis, thank you for the question.\\\\n    We have got to fix the Medicare physician reimbursement \\\\nschedule. And H.R. 2474 and 6371 need to be passed to allow \\\\nphysicians to maintain practices to preserve that sanctity, \\\\nwhich you so appropriately referenced, between the patient and \\\\nthe physician. We have got to fix that, and we need your help.\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Congressman, my--if you--number one for me is \\\\nsite-neutral payments. I think it is a major reason why we are \\\\nhaving--we are seeing physician practices get bought out.\\\\n    Second, dealing with Medicare Advantage prior authorization \\\\nthat we have talked about.\\\\n    I also think physician fee schedule is important. But if I \\\\nhad to order it, site-neutral; going after MA; dealing with \\\\nprivate equity. Those are major forces in the health system \\\\nthat we have to deal with.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you all very much.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Yes, Mrs. Miller, you are recognized.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. Thank you, Chairman Buchanan and Ranking \\\\nMember Doggett, and thank you all for being here today.\\\\n    I cannot agree more with the physicians on our committee \\\\nand the life that they have led, the lives you all have led, \\\\nand how important you are. You are so important.\\\\n    I live in West Virginia, a very, very rural state. You \\\\nknow, sometimes it can take from an hour to almost five hours, \\\\nreally, to get to your doctor or to your hospital because our \\\\nterrain is just very challenging. But we need care. And, you \\\\nknow, just for a routine checkup sometimes, it is critical that \\\\nour local, rural physician practices exist so that they aren&#x27;t \\\\nalways burdened, you know, with the far drive and the expensive \\\\nvisits to a hospital for something very minor. That has worried \\\\nme for years, having to go to a hospital for something very \\\\nminor when you could go to your family physician.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s economic environment, with inflation through the \\\\nroof, and thanks to the reckless spending that continues to go \\\\non with this Administration, many independent physician \\\\npractices cannot afford to keep their doors open. Frankly, I \\\\nthink the Federal Government doesn&#x27;t reimburse well enough to \\\\nmake it feasible for you to do it at all. So this is a huge \\\\nissue for physicians, as well as patients.\\\\n    Dr. Gholson, I was really disheartened to hear about your \\\\nstruggles and your practice that you endured because of bad \\\\npolicy. And I know firsthand how devastating it is to rural \\\\ncommunities to lose their local doctor. So to help paint the \\\\npicture for my colleagues that may not be from rural areas--and \\\\nthere are a lot of them that aren&#x27;t here that really ought to \\\\nhear this--can you go into detail about the different \\\\nphysician-patient relationships that happen in independent \\\\npractices, particularly in rural areas, compared to physicians \\\\nin these huge practices?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. So to paint the picture of how rural my \\\\ncommunity is, we are a one-stoplight town.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. Yes.\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. My patients would be able--they could walk to \\\\nmy practice to see me, because we were right downtown. I was \\\\nable to do home visits with my patients, which gave you \\\\nincredible insight to what was going on in their life. I would \\\\nsee them at Walmart, and they would talk to me about their \\\\ncare. I would see them in church, and they would ask me \\\\nquestions about which specialists they felt like they needed to \\\\ngo to. And even though I closed my practice in 2022, I still \\\\nget those questions from my former patients, even today.\\\\n    So you really are part of the community. You are part of \\\\nthe fabric. You sponsor the local baseball teams. You are at \\\\nthe team events for--as team physicians. The whole community \\\\nbecomes like family.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. You are almost the elder of the family, so to \\\\nspeak. I mean, you are that--you are just that important.\\\\n    As much as I would love to see every independent practice \\\\nthrive, I know that there are tons of challenges out there that \\\\nyou all face that can drive you to close or sell your practices \\\\nand move into a larger health system. Prior to having to make \\\\nthe impossible choice to close your practice, can you tell us \\\\nsome of the pressures that come with competing for your \\\\nworkforce with the larger health systems, or if there is any \\\\npressure to consolidate your practices?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. So for me, competing with the local hospital \\\\nis probably the biggest thing with my workforce. I could not \\\\ncompete with what they were able to pay my nursing staff. We \\\\nalready had a nursing shortage going into COVID, and COVID \\\\nexacerbated the nursing shortage. A lot of nurses started doing \\\\ntravel nursing.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. Oh, yes.\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. And so it was just very difficult to compete, \\\\nand physicians--and the hospitals had an advantage because of \\\\nthe facility fees they were able to garner from the care that \\\\nthey were receiving. So that made it very difficult to compete.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. You are right.\\\\n    Dr. Richardson, in order for people to understand more the \\\\nbusiness side of Medicare reimbursement simply not being enough \\\\nto even cover the costs of operating in a rural area, are there \\\\nexamples where Medicare regulations or reimbursement \\\\nrequirements have limited your practice&#x27;s ability to provide \\\\nhigh-quality services to your rural patients?\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. I think it is just more of everything is \\\\nmore difficult when you are treating patients in rural areas. \\\\nUnless you actually have a provider in that area, from a \\\\nspecialist standpoint, you are traveling. I mentioned earlier \\\\nwe have 13 clinics throughout the state. Those are clinics \\\\nwhere we actually get in our car, grab our staff, and grab our \\\\nequipment, our scopes, our drugs, put them in our trunk, drive \\\\nto that community to run a clinic, and sometimes do some simple \\\\noutpatient surgeries at that local, rural hospital, and then \\\\ndrive back. So it is just an increased burden. It is a burden \\\\nto your quality of life. It is a burden to your practice at \\\\nhome.\\\\n    We have had the discussion of consolidating care and making \\\\npatients drive to the Wichita metro area because we are so \\\\noverburdened there, and we just haven&#x27;t had the heart to do it \\\\nbecause many of these patients simply cannot or would not make \\\\nthe travel. They don&#x27;t have the social support or the resources \\\\nto drive three to four hours.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. That is right.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. And honestly, I think one of the biggest \\\\nimprovements we have had over the last couple of years, one of \\\\nthe good things that came out of the pandemic, was actually \\\\ntelemedicine.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. Right.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. There are so many of these patients in \\\\nrural Kansas that need a five-minute appointment with me that \\\\ncan easily be done over telemedicine. And so we have tried to \\\\ntake advantage of that when possible.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. Thank you for that answer.\\\\n    And I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzpatrick, you are recognized.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for \\\\nbeing here today.\\\\n    Medicare physician pay and its impacts on patient access to \\\\ncare remains a major issue in my community in Bucks and \\\\nMontgomery Counties in Pennsylvania, as it has been and \\\\ncontinues to be across the country. While I was pleased that \\\\nCongress acted in the March 8 government funding package to \\\\naddress the Medicare physician pay cuts, predictable, \\\\nsustainable reforms are still needed to prevent this in the \\\\nfuture.\\\\n    As you all are well aware, adjusted for inflation and \\\\npractice costs, Medicare physician pay plummeted a total of 29 \\\\npercent from 2001 to 2024, and physicians now face another \\\\nsteep 3 percent payment cut at the end of this year.\\\\n    My first question to you, Ms. Kean: Can you discuss some of \\\\nthe impacts that this pressing financial instability is having \\\\non physician practices, including things like difficulty in \\\\nretaining staff, trouble keeping their doors open, rising \\\\ncosts, administrative burdens, and the like?\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Thank you for the question. Yes. I mean, trying \\\\nto retain our staff has been very, very difficult, and it is \\\\nnot just the hospitals that we are competing against. I am \\\\ncompeting against retail entities that can just simply raise \\\\ntheir prices. We can&#x27;t do that. And so that is probably the \\\\nbiggest thing that is the impact there.\\\\n    And yes, Congress, you know, must act. You know, Congress \\\\nmust act to avoid these cuts. And we all cheer that, you know, \\\\nit wasn&#x27;t as bad as it could have been. It is as bad as it has \\\\never been, and it needs to be addressed immediately. If this \\\\npanel is trying to figure out how to protect private practices, \\\\nthat is the number-one thing. There is nothing else after that.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. And have you seen a disparate impact in \\\\nrural communities, underserved communities?\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Yes, absolutely. I mean, the rural communities \\\\nare impacted in a greater way. They are losing their doctors.\\\\n    And, you know, just listening to the physicians here--I am \\\\nnot a physician, but I am an advocate for them, and when I hear \\\\nthese stories, it just breaks my heart. It shouldn&#x27;t be like \\\\nthat. And it is because of these things that, you know, we are \\\\ntalking about today that are getting in the way of taking care \\\\nof patients, and for patients--or for doctors to even want to \\\\nbe doctors. We need help.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. Dr. Desai, you had stated in your \\\\ntestimony that since 2001 the cost of operating a medical \\\\npractice has increased by 47 percent. Could you explain how \\\\nthese operating costs have impacted your practice and others \\\\nlike yours?\\\\n    And how do you think Congress can address this?\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Congressman Fitzpatrick, thank you for the \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    You are absolutely right. The cost of seeing patients and \\\\nproviding the care that these patients deserve and need is \\\\nastronomically different from when I started in practice. When \\\\nyou look at the inflationary updates that Medicare hospitals \\\\nand skilled nursing facilities get that physicians simply \\\\nhaven&#x27;t been a part of and have been excluded from, it makes it \\\\nincredibly difficult to see patients on a day-to-day basis.\\\\n    I can just give you an example. In my practice alone we \\\\nhave to increase the volume of patients that we have to see on \\\\na day-to-day basis to justify the increasing overhead costs \\\\nthat I have to pay for these medical assistants to be able to \\\\nbe in the exam room typing on an iPad, when I should be \\\\nspending time with you, checking you for skin cancer and \\\\nmelanoma and creating that relationship, which I do on a \\\\nclinical basis, but I am challenged at the same time to make \\\\nsure I have assistance there to help me that I can afford to \\\\nkeep to be able to see those patients that I need to see \\\\nbecause the overhead is high.\\\\n    So it is an incredibly vicious cycle. And what concerns me \\\\nthe most is that my job is to save lives from skin cancer, make \\\\npeople&#x27;s skin disease better, keep people out of the hospital. \\\\nIt becomes incredibly challenging to do that when the day-to-\\\\nday practice of medicine keeps it very hard to simply keep the \\\\nlights on and to pay the bills to run the practice.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. Thank you, Dr. Desai.\\\\n    I just want to associate myself with the comments of Dr. \\\\nWenstrup. The world needs the United States of America, and the \\\\nonly way we can be there for America and the world is if we are \\\\nhealthy. And the only way we can be healthy is if the doctor-\\\\npatient relationship is healthy, as well. And the more--the \\\\ncriticism that I have always shared with my colleagues about \\\\nthe CFR, it is a cumulative registry. We always add to it, we \\\\nnever address what is redundant, what is duplicative, and what \\\\nis actually outcome-determinative in the opposite effect, the \\\\nopposite direction of what the intended purpose of that \\\\nregulation was.\\\\n    So I am hopeful that we are going to continue to work \\\\ntogether on this committee to address the redundancies. We \\\\ntalked about several of them here. Prior authorization is \\\\nprobably--I mean, in addition to physician cuts, Medicare \\\\npayment reimbursement, the amount of time you have to spend \\\\ndealing with bureaucrats rather than serving your patients \\\\ncould lead to the death of health care in America. And we have \\\\nto address it with urgency.\\\\n    I yield back, sir.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Beyer.\\\\n    Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you for \\\\nholding this and thank you for being here today.\\\\n    My sister, my father-in-law, and my uncle all had full \\\\ncareers as independent physicians, and I very much appreciate \\\\nthat this is one of those wonderful pieces of Ways and Means \\\\nwhere almost everybody on the committee agrees that we really \\\\nneed to make sure that we preserve the independent physician \\\\npractices.\\\\n    To that end, Dr. Jha, I am the father of two Brunonians, so \\\\nI am glad to have you here. But you championed site neutrality. \\\\nAnd 10 years ago Mike Pompeo, when he was a humble member of \\\\nthe House, and I sponsored a site neutrality bill, and I have \\\\ndone that every year since, which means I get a lot of visits \\\\nfrom hospitals who tell me why this is such a bad thing, that \\\\nthey deserve to get more because they are taking care of the \\\\nindigents. They have to be there 24 hours a day. They have all \\\\nthese arguments.\\\\n    From your perspective, why is site neutrality still so \\\\nimportant?\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes, Congressman thank you.\\\\n    Site neutrality is just critical for all of the reasons you \\\\nhave heard today. Look, if the issue for hospitals is they have \\\\nto take care of a sicker, a more indigent population, we should \\\\nfigure out how to pay for that directly. But what site \\\\nneutrality does is it totally perverts the health care \\\\nmarketplace, where there is now this very large incentive for \\\\nhospitals to buy up physician practices. And that doesn&#x27;t \\\\nincrease access, it doesn&#x27;t increase quality. All it does is it \\\\njust allows Medicare to pay a lot more. Consumers pay a lot \\\\nmore through private insurance.\\\\n    And there has been progress on site neutrality. I don&#x27;t \\\\nwant to say we have made no progress, but there are really \\\\nlarge sets of issues that are still not addressed.\\\\n    I think I have heard from my friends and colleagues in the \\\\nhospital industry who worry about this. You know, we have a \\\\nlong history in American health policy of doing X to solve Y. \\\\nIf the problem is that hospitals are not getting paid enough \\\\nfor certain things, let&#x27;s pay them more to do those certain \\\\nthings. Let&#x27;s not have a policy that totally perverts the \\\\nmarketplace. I think that is not the solution.\\\\n    And it is creating--I mean, if you think about where \\\\nprivate physicians have been largely getting bought out, it has \\\\nlargely been hospitals. Yes, private equity more recently. Yes, \\\\nMA is a huge part of the problem. But it is hospitals that have \\\\nbeen buying out practices because of a government policy that \\\\nwe can reverse.\\\\n    Mr. BEYER. By the way, that was exactly my family&#x27;s \\\\nexperience. My father-in-law retired, turned the practice over \\\\nto his younger colleague who, two years later, sold it to the \\\\nhospital because he had to.\\\\n    So Dr. Gholson, we really appreciate all the challenges \\\\nthat you and your practice have faced. You talked about--let me \\\\nquote--50 percent of your time on cumbersome administrative \\\\ntasks. We spent a lot of time up here on AI, and one of the \\\\nthings that seems to be exciting is ambient clinical \\\\ndocumentation. Can you use that? Is it affordable for a \\\\npractice in Mississippi? Would that change your life much?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. So yes, I use AI now to help create patient \\\\neducation materials. It saves time. I do have to review them.\\\\n    I am really looking forward to seeing what AI does in the \\\\ndocumentation arena, because we spend a lot of our time \\\\ndocumenting. So I think there is some promise with AI.\\\\n    I also am concerned on the flip side of what insurers are \\\\ngoing to do with AI that may be detrimental. So I think it \\\\nneeds to have some guardrails.\\\\n    Mr. BEYER. Yes, yes, yes. Every doctor I know is terrified \\\\nof a machine algorithm making the decision of what patient care \\\\nis.\\\\n    Ms. Kean, you are not a big fan of the way we do EHRs. How \\\\nwould you fix the electronic health record system?\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Oh, boy. That is a big question.\\\\n    You know, I think that interoperability is probably the \\\\nbiggest thing, and that is, you know, every single one of us, \\\\nwhen you come to our practice, we are going to ask you the same \\\\nquestions. Why do we have to keep asking those questions over \\\\nand over again? Isn&#x27;t there a way that we can communicate so \\\\nthat, you know, if the first physician asks those questions, it \\\\ncan be passed through to all of us?\\\\n    We need help with that. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it is \\\\nhappening. We do get medical records from other providers, and \\\\nit does come in automatically. But in order to actually figure \\\\nout what the care happened, you have to go through all of the \\\\nMIPS checkboxes of everything that somebody has asked the \\\\nquestions about that does not provide any real information to \\\\nthe doctor that needs to treat the patient. We need to know \\\\nwhat that other doctor had to say, and what they are sending to \\\\nus for----\\\\n    Mr. BEYER. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. KEAN [continuing]. And how we are going to be able to \\\\nevaluate that, and then get that information back to them. The \\\\nrest of the information that we are being asked is really for \\\\nthe record, from a billing perspective, and that is it.\\\\n    Mr. BEYER. Great, thank you. I know the Veterans Affairs \\\\nDepartment and the Department of Defense are trying to work \\\\nhard just to make veterans and active duty military EHRs work \\\\ntogether, and it has been a huge and problematic problem.\\\\n    All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Tenney, you are recognized.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the \\\\nwitnesses and for your expert testimony.\\\\n    I also really appreciate the insight that we receive on \\\\nthis committee from some of our doctors: Dr. Wenstrup, also Dr. \\\\nMurphy, and also Dr. Ferguson, who serves on the main \\\\ncommittee.\\\\n    And I have also served on numerous hospital boards, nursing \\\\nhome boards, and we have seen this shift away from the doctor-\\\\npatient relationship that we were all concerned about happening \\\\nif we tried to centralize and federalize our system, our health \\\\ncare system.\\\\n    I am a practicing attorney. We see this, a similar thing, \\\\nhappening in our legal field, where the bureaucrats decide what \\\\nlegal questions are answered. The bureaucrats decide what \\\\ndecisions judge make--judges make. My dad was also a judge.\\\\n    But I want to just touch on a couple of things, but I first \\\\nwant to ask all of you, because we have talked about these \\\\nissues in getting more doctors, better doctors, getting--more \\\\ninterested in getting into the health care system. Could I ask \\\\nyou, do you agree--and I am going to ask each one on the \\\\npanel--that we need to have and protect a merit-based system in \\\\nour health care field, that we have the very best people going \\\\ninto this field?\\\\n    And I just want to start with Dr. Gholson and go all the \\\\nway across the board. Do you think that that--we should \\\\ncontinue--or continue to protect a merit-based system in terms \\\\nof who gets to be a physician?\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. I do think we need to protect the merit-based \\\\nsystem, but I also think that the merits need to be \\\\ntransparent. We need to know the playing field by which we are \\\\nbeing judged. And right now that is not happening.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Okay. Can you just go on and give us, like, a \\\\none-sentence answer? Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Yes, definitely merit-based. You can&#x27;t walk \\\\ninto an ER and have someone treating you that was there because \\\\nof other factors besides their merit.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. All right, thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Kean.\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Yes, I absolutely agree.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Dr. Desai?\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Thank you, Congresswoman. Absolutely. I think we \\\\nneed to cultivate the best and brightest minds in this country \\\\nto go into medicine. We need that for the future of the health \\\\ncare system. We have those people in our country. We need to \\\\npromote them to become doctors.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. So transparently, we want to make sure that \\\\neveryone is qualified based on a neutral standard, not we don&#x27;t \\\\nknow who they are, we just know they are excellent when they \\\\ntake their boards.\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. And if they want to be a doctor, they can become \\\\na doctor.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. That is great. Thank you.\\\\n    Doctor Jha.\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes, I think I agree with my colleagues. \\\\nTransparent standards, merit-based. Very clear that we want a \\\\nworkforce that can take care of the American people at the \\\\nhighest quality possible.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Thank you so much.\\\\n    I just--I want to jump into a couple of questions. So \\\\nMedicare reimbursement to these providers, various providers, \\\\ndoctors who are failing to keep up with the increasing costs of \\\\noperating a physician practice, I hear--almost every doctor I \\\\nhave had in the last 20 years has retired or been--ended up as \\\\na hospitalist. You know, the cost of operating a practice, we \\\\nhave outlined this all day today.\\\\n    Medicare beneficiaries in my underserved area--Dr. Gholson, \\\\nI have towns in my district that have a stop sign, not even a \\\\nstoplight, so--and we have a dire physician need in upstate New \\\\nYork, way up in the rural areas. So these are huge problems.\\\\n    And the 2023 Medicare Trustees report identified ongoing \\\\nreimbursement gaps as a threat to long-term access to \\\\nphysicians for Medicare beneficiaries. I wanted to ask you to \\\\nwhat extent has the growing gap between the operational costs \\\\nof independent physician practices and Medicare&#x27;s actual \\\\npayment affected the viability of practices, and how has it \\\\nimpacted patient access in rural areas?\\\\n    And I want to ask Dr. Gholson that, and also Dr. \\\\nRichardson. If you could, just comment. We are struggling to \\\\nget any kind of MD in federally-funded health care spaces in \\\\nmy--in entire counties in my district. If you could just say--\\\\n--\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. Yes, I would--it impacts it tremendously. \\\\nEvery January I hold my breath, waiting for the fix. In the \\\\nmeantime, I am having discussions with my office manager of \\\\nwhat staff I am going to reduce hours or let go, which is going \\\\nto impact the access that my patients have to me.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. And Dr. Richardson.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Yes, I think I mentioned earlier that our \\\\nemployee overhead has gone up 30 percent in the last year, and \\\\nthat is not the only sector within our business that we are \\\\npaying more for. So I would venture to say Medicare Advantage \\\\nplans actually decrease access because, at least where I am, \\\\nmost of the specialists try not to participate in them. The \\\\npatients are always coming in saying, ``Well, I am trying to \\\\nfind an insurance plan that my doctor accepts,&#x27;&#x27; and those \\\\nMedicare Advantage--or disadvantage plans, whatever you want to \\\\ncall them--are actually decreasing access in my area.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Well, let me ask you, outside of congressional \\\\nintervention, you know, to update the physician fee schedule, \\\\nwhat else can we do? What kind of targeted reforms can we do \\\\ngenerally to the practice of medicine to create a stable, \\\\npredictable fee schedule that you can rely on, not knowing, you \\\\nknow, year end to the changes?\\\\n    What can we do? And I only have a few seconds left, but if \\\\nyou could, jump in.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. It has got to be tied to just the cost of \\\\ntaking care of patients. As long as we are taking care of--and \\\\nwe are able to keep a business open to take care of the \\\\npatients, whatever that fee schedule is----\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Well, what can we do in Congress?\\\\n    I mean, we would love to be able to give you better access \\\\nto that care, and better access to a reliable, stable, \\\\npredictable fee schedule.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Well, mark the index to the MEI, you know, \\\\nthe updates need to be, I think, indexed to the MEI to adjust \\\\nfor the cost of business.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Great. Thank you so much. I thank you all for \\\\nyour great testimony.\\\\n    And I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Moore, you are recognized.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Chairman Buchanan. Thanks for \\\\nholding this important Health Subcommittee hearing today on the \\\\nchallenges facing independent physician practices.\\\\n    And your expertise is very much appreciated today. Thank \\\\nyou, witnesses.\\\\n    A contributing factor to the collapse of private practice \\\\nare maybe well-meaning but overly burdensome reporting and \\\\nadministrative requirements placed on physicians such as the \\\\nMerit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS. Quality \\\\nmeasurement in MIPS can be costly, time-consuming, and, at \\\\ntimes, bear little relation to physicians&#x27; actual performance \\\\nin providing quality care to beneficiaries.\\\\n    One estimate found physicians spend an average of $12,800 \\\\nannually to comply with MIPS&#x27;s quality measure reporting, \\\\ndevoting approximately 53 hours per physician.\\\\n    A 2022 study in the Journal of the American Medical \\\\nAssociation found that MIPS scores are inconsistently related \\\\nto performance, and physicians caring for more medically and \\\\nsocially vulnerable patients were more likely to receive low \\\\nscores, despite providing high-quality care. Kind of \\\\ncounterintuitive, if you will.\\\\n    And among a survey of small, rural providers, few \\\\nparticipants felt that MIPS would improve quality care or--\\\\nsorry, improve care quality, or provide administrative relief.\\\\n    I had a group--as soon as I came, one of my first meetings \\\\nI came on when I came on the Ways and Means, even--came and \\\\nlaid all this out for us on the issues that exist within the \\\\nquality care standards within this program. And this is not a \\\\nbig attention-getting issue. This isn&#x27;t going to cause a lot of \\\\nbickering back and forth between parties. This is a fundamental \\\\nproblem, the way that CMS operates and it has existed for \\\\nyears. It should be low-hanging fruit.\\\\n    And I would love to just get a little perspective to find \\\\nways to accurately reflect patients&#x27; outcomes and the value a \\\\nphysician is providing to the Medicare program. Dr. Desai, do \\\\nyou feel that quality reporting metrics and MIPS, more broadly, \\\\ndo a good job of accurately assessing the level of care you \\\\nprovide to patients?\\\\n    What recommendations do you have to reform these quality \\\\nmeasures?\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Congressman Moore, thank you very much for that \\\\nvery pertinent and valuable question, and I appreciate you \\\\nbringing up the challenges of reporting burdens, because \\\\nreporting is burdensome.\\\\n    MIPS has not shown to help make care better as a well-\\\\nrounded outcome for patients. I can tell you, from my \\\\nexperience, the art of that office visit, the 20 minutes that I \\\\nwant to spend with you talking about your skin disease, some of \\\\nthat goes into clicking buttons on an iPad that have nothing to \\\\ndo with what you are there to see me for. For example, if you \\\\nare coming in to see me to take care of a melanoma, which is a \\\\ndeadly skin cancer, half of the things that I have to report in \\\\nyour chart that day have nothing to do with your medical \\\\nhistory related to your skin cancer.\\\\n    We know that MIPS has caused challenges, and I will give \\\\nyou one example. There was a study that actually showed doctors \\\\nwho took care of patients from a higher social risk perspective \\\\nended up with lower MIPS scores, and actually got decreased \\\\nreimbursement, even though they were taking care of patients \\\\nwho are much more at risk, and have much more complex medical \\\\nillnesses. So we have got to fix MIPS. It hasn&#x27;t improved \\\\nanything.\\\\n    And what is challenging is CMS is now going into the next \\\\nphase of MIPS value pathways and other systems which are \\\\nseemingly supposed to improve that process, and have already, \\\\nprior to implementation, posed major challenges.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. So again, counter-intuitive.\\\\n    Dr. Richardson and Dr. Jha, I saw you nodding, as well. \\\\nAnything to quickly add to that?\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. No, the reporting is largely meaningless. \\\\nHe is spot on. Most of what we are reporting and spending \\\\noffice time and personnel time to do has nothing to do with the \\\\ncare that the patient is there for, especially when you are \\\\ndealing with specialists.\\\\n    I take care of a lot of advanced prostate cancer patients, \\\\nand we are spending time charting, documenting, following up, \\\\nfinding out if they had their colonoscopy or if they want to \\\\nstop smoking. And granted, those things are great from a \\\\ngeneral practitioner standpoint, but many of these reporting \\\\ndetails, from a specialist&#x27;s standpoint, are completely \\\\nmeaningless.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. And there is no tie to quality or value.\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes, and I will say this. This is a very classic \\\\nproblem of policy. I think it was a well-intended program when \\\\nit was first created. It had bipartisan support. Some of us \\\\nwere hopeful that it would actually work. It really hasn&#x27;t. \\\\nLike, the evidence here is MIPS doesn&#x27;t improve quality, it \\\\njust burdens physicians. And at this moment we have just got to \\\\nfind a path forward.\\\\n    And I will say quality reporting is important, as a \\\\nconcept. The measure should be we should have a smaller number \\\\nof measures, it should be automatically collected, and they \\\\nshould focus on things that patients care about, patient \\\\noutcomes. We can do that. We have the technology. That is not \\\\nwhat MIPS is achieving today.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Even in my remarks that talked about \\\\nbeing well-meaning, well-meaning at first and it just hasn&#x27;t--\\\\nit hasn&#x27;t hit the mark.\\\\n    We are working on a lot of things to enhance transparency \\\\nand incorporate provider, patient, and other stakeholders&#x27; \\\\nperspectives. Right from your initial responses, like, you give \\\\nme more motivation to continue on with that initial \\\\nconversation I have. Our team is all in on this, and would love \\\\nto engage with any of you and continue to any of my colleagues.\\\\n    So again, thank you, Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Mrs. Steel, you are recognized.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Apart from Hawaii, California ranks first among the states \\\\nwith the highest cost of living, between 35 to 45 percent above \\\\nthe national average. California consumers have been--I mean, \\\\nhave seen--prices grow about 20 percent overall in 2020, and \\\\nmany are experiencing continued rising prices, especially in \\\\nservices such as medical care, housing, and electricity, and \\\\nothers.\\\\n    At the same time, California seniors are facing a physician \\\\nshortage heightened from the pandemic, physician burnout, \\\\nrising overhead costs, and declining reimbursement. And the \\\\nphysician shortage is impacting patients across--access to \\\\nnecessary care. And it is much worse in California.\\\\n    And I am just so glad that all the witnesses are coming \\\\nhere that, you know, we can discuss about independent \\\\nphysicians. And thank you for all coming.\\\\n    And I just want to ask all the witnesses. California&#x27;s \\\\nphysician practice landscape is rapidly changing toward an \\\\nincrease in market consolidation and vertical integration. That \\\\nis what I see in California. What do these trends mean for \\\\npatients I represent and to the doctors, for especially \\\\nindependent doctors?\\\\n    You can just--anybody who wants to answer it is going to be \\\\ngreat.\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Well, maybe, Congresswoman, I will just start by \\\\nsaying very quickly the evidence on consolidation is actually \\\\nquite clear when--whether it is vertical consolidation, it is \\\\nhorizontal consolidation, consolidation that is really not \\\\nfocused on integration and improving care tends to cost more, \\\\npatients have worse experience, physicians who practice in them \\\\nare--worse experience. It is sort of one of those rare things \\\\nwhere everybody is worse off, except maybe the provider \\\\norganization that can make more money.\\\\n    So there is a series of things that we can do to deal with \\\\nthat consolidation. We have talked about a lot about some of \\\\nthose policies: site neutrality, dealing with MA, vigorous \\\\nenforcement of antitrust. But this is an issue that is really \\\\nprominent in California, but it is prominent across the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Congresswoman Steel, thank you very much for \\\\nbringing that up, and I appreciate you asking about seniors, \\\\nbecause I think it is incredibly important that we realize \\\\nthat, when we talk about Medicare payment system, we are \\\\ntalking about seniors being able to see a doctor for the health \\\\ncare they deserve, that they have dedicated their lives for, \\\\nand that they need.\\\\n    And I think that all of my panelists agree that, once we \\\\nget the appropriate level of inflation-adjusted reimbursement \\\\ntied to the MEI with bills like H.R. 2474 and 6371, we can at \\\\nleast start to preserve and ensure that seniors have the access \\\\nthat they need.\\\\n    I will also mention that when we talk about access to care, \\\\nwe need to make sure that the health care system still attracts \\\\nyoung students and young, bright minds to go into medicine who \\\\nwant to become doctors and serve patients. Otherwise, when we \\\\nall become seniors, who is going to take care of us?\\\\n    I give you an example of my daughter, an 11-year-old. She \\\\nwants to be a dermatologist and take care of patients with skin \\\\ndisease when she gets older. I hope there is a practice of \\\\nmedicine and dermatology for her to become one. I honestly \\\\ndon&#x27;t know what the future holds, and I really appreciate you \\\\nbringing up the aspect of seniors&#x27; care, because it represents \\\\na phase of life that we will all be in at some point. Thank \\\\nyou.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Ms. Kean, before you go, you know, you were \\\\ntalking about the redundancy that, you know, you were asking \\\\nthese questions that every patient is coming in, and AI is a \\\\nreally big part of it. And I am glad that I am not on the--just \\\\nthe Ways and Means Committee and our Health Subcommittee, but I \\\\nam on the AI task force, too.\\\\n    So we have been talking a lot about health care issues \\\\nbecause we want to prevent that redundancy and time wasting \\\\nwith the patients, and you can see--actually give more to, you \\\\nknow, patients&#x27; attention instead of that, you know, asking \\\\nsame questions over and over and then try to get the records, \\\\nyou know, from the other doctors. So I just want to talk about \\\\njust a little bit more that, you know what--we have a policy, \\\\nand you cannot really share much about these patients and other \\\\nstuff. How are we going to help, and how are we going to store \\\\nthese, you know, data?\\\\n    Because I am on the Select Committee on China, too. So, you \\\\nknow what? We see a lot of these data that has been stolen. So, \\\\nyou know, how are we going to really, you know, store all these \\\\ndata, and how are we going to share only with our physicians?\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Yes, I think that, you know, putting the care \\\\nback in the hands of the patients, and the medical records back \\\\nin the hands of the patients, I think, is probably the primary \\\\nthing that could happen. If you allow them to contain that, to \\\\nhave access to the medical records, we are huge proponents of \\\\nthat. We want patients to be 100 percent involved in their \\\\ncare, and that means knowing what is in their charts.\\\\n    I think that that is probably a way to go, and to find some \\\\nway to protect that would be, you know, critical.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Chairman, my time is up. I have a lot of \\\\nquestions here, so I am going to just submit in writing.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Okay.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Ms. Van Duyne, you are recognized.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Two weeks ago the House Committee on Small Business held a \\\\nhearing on examining the impacts of the regulatory burden on \\\\nsmall practices. I am glad to see us holding this hearing in \\\\nthis committee, and it is clear that over-regulating is killing \\\\nprivate practices.\\\\n    In Texas&#x27;s 24th district I have hosted a number of \\\\nroundtables with doctors, who have--many of--are attendees here \\\\ntoday as a witness.\\\\n    Dr. Desai, thank you so much. It is great to see you here \\\\ntoday. I appreciate you making the trip up. I always make it a \\\\npoint to ask our physicians how much time that they spend in a \\\\nscreening. You were talking about this earlier, doing \\\\nadministrative work versus face to face with their patients. \\\\nAnd it is shocking to hear the time that our medical providers \\\\nhave to spend on compliance. And they would rather, obviously, \\\\nstrongly prefer to spend the time with their patients.\\\\n    In fact, one local doctor--I am sure you remember this--she \\\\neven shared a heartbreaking story about how she had finally \\\\nachieved the American dream. She had opened her own practice, \\\\nonly to be forced to sell it because it got too expensive to \\\\nkeep up with all of the government red tape.\\\\n    When regulatory costs reach the point that it is no longer \\\\nfeasible for small, private health care practices to keep their \\\\ndoors open, it leads to one thing, and you have been mentioning \\\\nthis all day: consolidation. That decreases quality of care, it \\\\nlimits competition, which increase costs, and it limits the \\\\npossibility of physicians owning their own businesses, thereby \\\\nrestricting access to care and ultimately hurting patients.\\\\n    We can&#x27;t continue to allow over-regulation to shut the \\\\ndoors of small care providers, and I am glad that our committee \\\\nis focused on finding solutions to provide better and more \\\\naffordable patient care.\\\\n    Dr. Desai, it is great to see you again. And I would like \\\\nto ask you what reforms that you would like to see that would \\\\nencourage higher quality care in Medicare, while reducing those \\\\nkind of burdens for physicians.\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Congresswoman Van Duyne, it is great to see you, \\\\nas well. And thank you, in particular, for your leadership and \\\\nall of the work that you are doing in this space, along with \\\\nthe subcommittee and the committee.\\\\n    I think you hit the nail on the head. I think the fact that \\\\nwe are here in a meeting talking about physicians not being \\\\nable to dedicate their time to serving the patients&#x27; needs \\\\nbecause they are too busy filling out paperwork, clicking \\\\nbuttons, on a phone call, hiring dedicated employees that are \\\\nfull-time equivalents with full salaries simply to do \\\\nburdensome paperwork like prior authorizations like we have \\\\ntalked about is the problem.\\\\n    I think we have got to make sure that we, as physicians, \\\\nget reimbursed for the care that we are providing. And I think \\\\nthe important message here is, with all of your leadership on \\\\nbills like H.R. 2474 and 6371, we can at least start to make \\\\nsure that those of us in private practice, those in academic \\\\npractice, those in large groups--this is all across the entire \\\\nhealth care spectrum--can continue to practice, and see those \\\\npatients, and keep the doors open.\\\\n    I will give you one quick example. I had a patient with \\\\nsevere eczema, which typically is something that we treat on a \\\\nvery common daily basis, itchy red rash over the body. I can \\\\nget that better pretty quickly. This patient, a young law \\\\nstudent, an SMU law student, ended up in the ICU in the \\\\nhospital with total body erythroderma. Just picture a full-body \\\\nburn. The reason she ended up in the hospital, a 21-year-old \\\\nlaw student, highly-functioning, bright young lady ended up in \\\\nthe hospital because of the fact that the insurance company \\\\nwould not prescribe her the biologic medication that would get \\\\nher clear in two to three doses because they wanted her to--a \\\\ncream for a rash that covers 80 percent of her body.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. That is crazy.\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. She was in the hospital in the ICU, almost died, \\\\nand now is recovering from that. So----\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you for sharing that.\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. You know, we have heard many of the \\\\nDemocrats that have labeled private equity as a villain, and I \\\\nhave heard from a significant number of physicians that they \\\\nare starting to look into private equity as an investment so \\\\nthey don&#x27;t have to consolidate. What are the positive impacts \\\\nof private equity investment in medical practices?\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. I think when we talk about competition, I think \\\\ncompetition is a good thing. I think access is a good thing. I \\\\nthink when you have only one or two players in town, if you \\\\nwill, that is a problem.\\\\n    We, everyone in this room, is a patient at some point in \\\\ntheir life. We want to be able to pick the doctor that we like, \\\\nthat we believe in their credentials, that we connect with, \\\\nthat we can have a rapport with. If you have only got two to \\\\nchoose from, that is going to limit your options. And I think, \\\\nwhen we encourage competition broadly in the best interests of \\\\nthe highest quality patient care, that is where we need to \\\\nland.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. And you are saying private equity is \\\\nsomething that actually helps increase the competition within \\\\nthose markets, as opposed to decrease?\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Well, and I think I would frame it in the way \\\\nthat private--not all private equity is bad. Not every academic \\\\nmedical center is great. Not every hospital system is great. I \\\\nthink we can&#x27;t label a one-size-fits-all approach. I think we \\\\nhave to be open minded to make sure, hey, if you are a doctor \\\\nin this practice model and you can deliver exceptional care, \\\\nthen you are doing a great job.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Excellent.\\\\n    Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Mr. Estes, you are recognized.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for \\\\nallowing me to waive on to the Health Subcommittee, which I am \\\\nnot currently a member of.\\\\n    And thank you to all the witnesses who spent a lot of your \\\\ntime today talking about issues that are important to you, but \\\\nalso important to us. I want to particularly welcome Dr. \\\\nRichardson to our committee who is from Wichita, and I have \\\\nbeen to their facility there, and I appreciate the opportunity \\\\nto see, you know, the day-to-day activities.\\\\n    You know, as you noted, Dr. Richardson, your practice \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t just serve patients in Wichita, but across the State of \\\\nKansas and into Oklahoma. And also, you know, across the \\\\ncountry, physicians like you are serving rural Americans, \\\\nproviding quality health care to parts of our country that are \\\\ntoo small to support specialists on their own.\\\\n    Unfortunately, we are seeing the bureaucratic red tape, \\\\nlower reimbursement rates, rising prices are all weighing \\\\nheavily on your independent physician practices. And we are \\\\nseeing those private practices close or consolidate as a \\\\nresult.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I have a letter that Dr. Wenstrup gave me \\\\nfrom a primary care physician who talked about being an \\\\nindependent physician versus being a hospital employee, and I \\\\nwould like to submit that for the record.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Without objection.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6472A.054\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Thank you.\\\\n    You know, as I have spoken with patients and physicians and \\\\nsupport staff throughout Kansas, consolidating or closing \\\\npractices is not helping Kansans receive more or better-quality \\\\ncare. With fewer and fewer doctors and nurses in private \\\\npractice, patients are seeing increased costs and, in some \\\\ncases, worse outcomes.\\\\n    The Kellogg School of Management notes that prices increase \\\\n14 percent when a private practice is acquired by a hospital, \\\\nand a National Opinion Research Center survey found that 45 \\\\npercent of physicians report deteriorating patient-provider \\\\nrelationships after consolidation. These increased costs and \\\\ndiminished outcomes are not the recipe for a healthy society, \\\\nand our committee must prioritize solutions that preserve the \\\\nvital role of private practices.\\\\n    Dr. Richardson, I am especially intrigued by your practice \\\\nbecause you have been able to stay independent while serving \\\\nmore than a million patients throughout rural parts of our \\\\nstate. In your testimony you highlighted the fact that Wichita \\\\nUrology has managed to remain independent, in part because of \\\\nthe shortage of urologists in Kansas. Unfortunately, urology is \\\\nfar from the only specialty with a physician shortage in \\\\nKansas, which, as you know, often impacts, most importantly, \\\\nthe rural parts of our state.\\\\n    Can you elaborate on how your private practice is still \\\\nopen to serve these rural areas, and how that is not often an \\\\noption for physician groups that have been acquired?\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Yes, thank you. Thank you for being here, \\\\nand nice to see you.\\\\n    Yes, we are not unique in the specialty in our area that \\\\ndoes these outreach clinics. Gastroenterology, cardiology, \\\\nrheumatology, a lot of the specialists do the same outreach \\\\nclinics throughout rural Kansas because they know it is needed, \\\\nbecause they know that those patients can&#x27;t drive three to four \\\\nhours, and those patients don&#x27;t often have any specialists in \\\\nthose areas.\\\\n    Speaking on consolidation, there is a hospital system that \\\\ndoes own specialists that do no outreach, right? So that is--\\\\nthat is the picture of consolidation in our area. The \\\\nindependent physicians are reaching out doing telemedicine, \\\\ndriving, having clinics at these rural communities to reach \\\\nthose rural patients while the consolidated hospital system is \\\\nnot. They are allowing those patients to drive.\\\\n    You also mentioned the increased cost of running a medical \\\\npractice, the inflation. It is that reason only that we have \\\\nconsidered consolidating ourselves back to Wichita, and taking \\\\nour staff out of those outreach clinics. It is not because we \\\\ndon&#x27;t enjoy seeing those patients in the rural areas. It is not \\\\nbecause those rural patients don&#x27;t need it. It is because we \\\\nalmost can&#x27;t afford it with the difficulty in hiring new \\\\nnurses, new MAs, the increased cost of running health care. We \\\\nhave talked about, just from a financial standpoint, \\\\nconsolidating. And like I said, we haven&#x27;t had the heart to do \\\\nit, and I hope we won&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t think we will. But that is \\\\nthe only reason we have even had that conversation.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Yes, I thank you for that. I know we have much \\\\nmore importance around--the folks that live in Wichita or other \\\\nurban areas don&#x27;t realize and take--I mean, they take health \\\\ncare for granted because you may have 10 or 20 specialists 10 \\\\nor 20 minutes away that you can actually interact with. It is \\\\nnot necessarily the case in rural areas.\\\\n    You also mentioned about site-neutral payments, and they \\\\ndon&#x27;t necessarily equalize. Can you provide further details on \\\\nhow policies could be managed without necessarily reducing \\\\npayments to hospitals?\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. Yes, like I said in my opening statement, I \\\\ndon&#x27;t think the right thing is to just decrease payments to \\\\nhospitals. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily help physician practices \\\\nstay in business. It doesn&#x27;t help access, it doesn&#x27;t help the \\\\npatients. But I do think that it is an unfair, unlevel playing \\\\nfield. Right now we are competing with those systems for the \\\\nsame providers, the same doctors, the same nurses, the same \\\\nMAs, which makes it difficult for us to run an independent \\\\npractice.\\\\n    So I think site neutrality is, if not the most important, \\\\none of the top two important things of keeping independent \\\\nphysicians in practice. We are simply just competing against \\\\nsomeone that we can&#x27;t beat. And so I think a more reasonable \\\\nsolution would be to modestly have a decrease in the HOPD \\\\npayment and a modest increase in the physician. Knowing that is \\\\nasking to just decrease payments for hospitals. That doesn&#x27;t \\\\nhelp our practice to stay in business, that doesn&#x27;t help us \\\\nserve patients, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t help increase access.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Well, thank you, and thank you to all the \\\\npanelists.\\\\n    Again, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Thank you.\\\\n    I would like to submit a letter in the record from a doctor \\\\nin my community.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Let me just kind of give you one easy \\\\none, but I need to get kind of your thoughts and ideas on this \\\\nbecause we are going to wrap up, we are just about done.\\\\n    Tort reform. I am from Florida. We have a lot of frivolous \\\\nlawsuits, a lot of lawsuits, and I am curious about how that \\\\nimpacts your business--one, from premiums and two is just from \\\\ndefensive medicine. I don&#x27;t know how you can measure that, but \\\\nI think it is something that probably can be measured, where \\\\npeople do procedures or things because they just want to be \\\\ncareful or be sure about that.\\\\n    The other thing is I can just tell you in our area we have \\\\na lot of doctors, in their late 50s, early 60s, that have made \\\\ngood money, surgeons and others, and they want to hang onto it, \\\\nand they are worried about practicing out there. If something \\\\ngoes wrong, someone is going to take their net worth. And so it \\\\nis a big, big issue in Florida.\\\\n    But Doctor, why don&#x27;t we start with you, and we will just \\\\nrun through here real quick? This is going to be the wrap-up \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Dr. GHOLSON. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    In Mississippi we had state-level tort reform in the early \\\\n2000s, which made a huge impact on our ability to continue to \\\\npractice medicine. For family medicine in particular, it did \\\\ndecrease the number of family medicine physicians who did OB, \\\\nand we are actually seeing the consequences of that now.\\\\n    But I do know, for family medicine doctors who want to do \\\\nOB, the price of malpractice is still an issue. It is still \\\\novertly high.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Yes.\\\\n    Dr. Richardson.\\\\n    Dr. RICHARDSON. So tort reform is never going to be turned \\\\ndown by physicians, and it is a very important thing to \\\\ndiscuss, and I think it is a very good thing. It is very \\\\nspecific, or it is very specialty-specific and very state \\\\nspecific. There are some specialties where tort reform is \\\\nabsolutely crucial to allow them to stay in business and \\\\ncontinue to work until they are 65. In some specialties, it is \\\\nnot as crucial.\\\\n    I think it pales in comparison to moving the needle \\\\ncompared to site neutrality and physician fee updates. But it \\\\nis certainly an important thing to address, especially in some \\\\nspecialties in states.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Yes, and I do know every state is \\\\ndifferent. I put that--50 states, you all look at this a little \\\\nbit differently.\\\\n    Ms. Kean.\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. Yes. We in Texas passed tort reform a little over \\\\n20 years ago. And it--I can tell you, it just, you know, \\\\nfirsthand, it absolutely impacted the malpractice rates our \\\\nphysicians were paying. It decreased it substantially.\\\\n    Texas is a very friendly state for physicians. We see a lot \\\\nof physicians that want to come there because of tort reform. \\\\nThey feel like, you know, they won&#x27;t lose, you know, everything \\\\nthat they have worked so hard for if something terrible \\\\nhappens. And so I would absolutely look to Texas to see how \\\\nthey did that, because it is working very well for us.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Yes, I have heard good things about \\\\nTexas.\\\\n    Dr. Desai.\\\\n    Ms. KEAN. It is working.\\\\n    Dr. DESAI. Mr. Chairman, thanks for this important question \\\\nand topic.\\\\n    I will quote you a statistic. I read a study by the AMA \\\\nthat said in 2022 over 30 percent of physicians reported being \\\\nsued. That is a staggering number, and that is exactly, to your \\\\npoint, why there is so much concern from physicians to even go \\\\ninto medicine or to continue practicing and doing procedures \\\\nthat are well within their scope of practice, but out of fear \\\\nthat they could be sued, potentially by anyone, depending on \\\\ntheir state legislation.\\\\n    At the American Academy of Dermatology Association, we \\\\ncertainly support broad, Federal medical liability system \\\\nreform, but we have got to put in common-sense limits into \\\\nthese medical liability regulations. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Doctor Jha.\\\\n    Dr. JHA. Yes, very briefly, I am going to largely echo what \\\\nDr. Richardson said. I mean, this is an important issue. I \\\\nthink there is good evidence that the malpractice system in our \\\\ncountry leads to over-utilization of certain types of testing. \\\\nThe defensive medicine we talked about, the data on that, I \\\\nthink, is quite clear.\\\\n    There has been progress at the state level. There are \\\\ncertain specialties that are still at risk. It is one part of \\\\nthe bigger picture we have been talking about today, which is \\\\nhow do we keep independent physicians in check. We have got to \\\\ndeal with all of the other stuff: site-neutrality, Medicare \\\\nAdvantage, physician fee schedule updates. If we do all of that \\\\nand make this a part of that solution, I do think we can get to \\\\na better place.\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. I think part of the reason that they go \\\\nafter--in our state, again--the doctors is because they have a \\\\nreputation to protect, and they know that. And I think for some \\\\nof them, they take advantage of it. But I am glad to see what \\\\nTexas and some of the other stuff has done. Now, everybody \\\\nshould have their day in court, in a sense. But my point is we \\\\nneed to take a look at stuff that is frivolous.\\\\n    But I want to thank all of you. I think it has been very \\\\nproductive. I think our members are excited about the input we \\\\nhave gotten. As someone mentioned earlier, you are all busy, \\\\nall successful people. We really do appreciate you coming up, \\\\nand you do have a big--you do make a big difference. Thank you, \\\\nand have a great day.\\\\n    [Pause.]\\\\n    Chairman BUCHANAN. Again, let me just add one thing. I \\\\nwould like to thank our witnesses for appearing before us \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    Please be advised that members have two weeks to submit \\\\nwritten questions to the witnesses--with answers later in \\\\nwriting. Those questions and your answers will be made part of \\\\nthe formal hearing record.\\\\n    With that, the subcommittee stands adjourned.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 11:21 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]      \\\\n\\\\n                    MEMBER QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n      \\\\n   GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n                   PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS FOR THE RECORD\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n    GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n                             [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/117533/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"07/23/2024\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73197, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"Judiciary\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                    OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU\\\\n                               OF PRISONS\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n                                HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                     SUBCOMMITTEE ON CRIME AND FEDERAL \\\\n                        GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE\\\\n\\\\n                                 OF THE\\\\n\\\\n                       COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\\\\n\\\\n                     U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             SECOND SESSION\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                         TUESDAY, JULY 23, 2024\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                           Serial No. 118-92\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n         Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\\\\n         \\\\n[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]         \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n               Available via: http://judiciary.house.gov\\\\n               \\\\n                              __________\\\\n\\\\n                   U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE                    \\\\n56-426                     WASHINGTON : 2024                    \\\\n          \\\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------                \\\\n              \\\\n                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\\\\n\\\\n                        JIM JORDAN, Ohio, Chair\\\\n\\\\nDARRELL ISSA, California             JERROLD NADLER, New York, Ranking \\\\nMATT GAETZ, Florida                      Member\\\\nANDY BIGGS, Arizona                  ZOE LOFGREN, California\\\\nTOM McCLINTOCK, California           STEVE COHEN, Tennessee\\\\nTOM TIFFANY, Wisconsin               HENRY C. ``HANK&#x27;&#x27; JOHNSON, Jr., \\\\nTHOMAS MASSIE, Kentucky                  Georgia\\\\nCHIP ROY, Texas                      ADAM SCHIFF, California\\\\nDAN BISHOP, North Carolina           ERIC SWALWELL, California\\\\nVICTORIA SPARTZ, Indiana             TED LIEU, California\\\\nSCOTT FITZGERALD, Wisconsin          PRAMILA JAYAPAL, Washington\\\\nCLIFF BENTZ, Oregon                  J.

The Crime Subcommittee and Government \\\\nSurveillance Subcommittee is called to order.\\\\n    We welcome everyone to today&#x27;s hearing on the Federal \\\\nBureau of Prisons. Before we begin today, I want to acknowledge \\\\nthe passing of our friend and colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee, a \\\\nlongtime Member of this Committee and of the U.S. House of \\\\nRepresentatives.\\\\n    The Ranking Member Jackson Lee was first elected to the \\\\nHouse 30 years ago. She previously served as Chair of this \\\\nSubcommittee, and I had the opportunity to be her Ranking \\\\nMember, and then we swapped positions. It was always a cordial \\\\nand professional relationship.\\\\n    While we may not have seen eye to eye on every issue, on \\\\nmost issues, in fact, I admired her, and I appreciated her \\\\ntenacity and commitment. We had many frank discussions \\\\nexpressing sincerely held positions. She was a fierce and loyal \\\\nadvocate for her constituents.\\\\n    She leaves behind her husband, her two children, and two \\\\ngrandchildren, and she will be missed by the Members on both \\\\nside of the aisle.\\\\n    Before we take a moment of silence, I am going to yield \\\\ntime to Representative McBath.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Thank you, Chair. Thank you.\\\\n    I would like to take a moment to honor my friend, mentor, \\\\nand my sister, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.\\\\n    She was a true powerhouse who fought for the betterment of \\\\nour country and all its people. She was a genuine force to be \\\\nreckoned with, always focused on making this country safer, \\\\nmore equitable, and more just.\\\\n    She was the first woman appointed Ranking Member of this \\\\nSubcommittee, and went on to fearlessly serve as Chair in the \\\\n117th Congress. Her leadership on civil right issues will \\\\ncontinue to be felt in Congress and all across this country. \\\\nShe uplifted marginalized communities, championed human rights, \\\\nand tirelessly defended our democracy.\\\\n    As a mentor, Congresswoman Jackson Lee showed me the ropes. \\\\nShe took me under her wing during my freshman year. She was one \\\\nof my first friends on Capitol Hill and offered her support for \\\\nme even before I came to Washington. I thank God I had the \\\\nchance to know her and receive her precious guidance.\\\\n    We served together as moms determined to make a better \\\\nworld. I will do everything that I can in my power to keep that \\\\nwork going. I want to take this time to thank the Congresswoman \\\\nfor everything that she has done for all of us, the least of \\\\nus, the least of these. For her fighting spirit to the very \\\\nend.\\\\n    I am praying for her family, her staff, and for all of us \\\\nfeeling the impact of this loss. Sheila is one of a kind, the \\\\nonly Sheila Jackson Lee.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. Let&#x27;s pause now for a moment of \\\\nsilence to remember.\\\\n    Oh, I&#x27;m sorry, Mr. Nadler. Please, I yield to you.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Mr. Chair, it is still hard to believe that we \\\\nwill never again see our dear friend and colleague Sheila \\\\nJackson Lee take her place on this dais.\\\\n    She ably led the Crime Subcommittee as Chair and later \\\\nserved as Ranking Member. No matter her title, she was always a \\\\nleader. The mark she made on this Subcommittee through her \\\\nforceful advocacy for criminal justice, police accountability, \\\\ngun safety, combating domestic violence, preventing \\\\ntrafficking, protecting victims, and so many more issues will \\\\nlive on for many years to come.\\\\n    Sheila never let an opportunity pass to stand up for her \\\\nconstituents, and she was a determined champion for all those \\\\nwho are marginalized in society and who needed her voice in \\\\nCongress to represent them.\\\\n    I will have a little more to say tomorrow in the Full \\\\nCommittee, but I thank the Chair for recognizing me, and for \\\\ntaking the time to remember such a valued Member of this \\\\nSubcommittee, as well as a treasured colleague and friend. May \\\\nher memory be a blessing.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Nadler. The Chair recognizes the \\\\nChair of the entire Committee, Mr. Jordan.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    No one could get more out of five minutes than Sheila \\\\nJackson Lee. She was a friend to everyone on both sides of the \\\\naisle, someone that we are all going to miss. I love what the \\\\nChair said. I think both he and the Ranking Member and Ms. \\\\nMcBath said it all well.\\\\n    So, we are going to miss her. One of a kind, one of a kind.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. Let&#x27;s pause now for a moment of \\\\nsilence to remember our friend and colleague, Sheila Jackson \\\\nLee.\\\\n    [Moment of silence.]\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. I will now ask the gentleman from \\\\nWisconsin to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.\\\\n    All. I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States \\\\nof America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one \\\\nNation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for \\\\nall.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. I will now recognize myself for an \\\\nopening statement.\\\\n    I thank the Members for coming to this morning&#x27;s important \\\\nhearing, thank the Director for being here. Today&#x27;s hearing is \\\\ntitled ``Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    The Federal Bureau of Prisons is a component of the \\\\nDepartment of Justice, DOJ. The BOP&#x27;s mission is to protect \\\\nsociety by confining offenders in the controlled environments \\\\nof prisons and community-based facilities that are safe, \\\\nhumane, cost-efficient and--keep talking, OK.\\\\n    So, BOP&#x27;s mission is to protect society by confining \\\\noffenders in the controlled environments of prisons and \\\\ncommunity-based facilities that are safe, humane, cost-\\\\nefficient, and appropriately secure, and that provide work and \\\\nother self-improvement opportunities to assist offenders in \\\\nbecoming law-abiding citizens.\\\\n    At a time of rising crime, this is a critically important \\\\nfunction. BOP operates 122 institutions and locations \\\\nthroughout the Nation, and these institutions are operated at \\\\nfive different security levels in order to confine offenders in \\\\nan appropriate manner.\\\\n    As of last month, BOP is responsible for the custody and \\\\ncare of more than 158,000 inmates and employs more than 35,000 \\\\nindividuals. Five and a half years ago, President Trump signed \\\\ninto the law the First Step Act of 2018. The First Step Act \\\\nsought to reduce the size of the Federal prison population and \\\\nreduce recidivism while still maintaining public safety.\\\\n    The Act&#x27;s three main goals were (1) correctional reform, \\\\n(2) sentencing reform regarding penalties for Federal offenses, \\\\nand (3) reauthorization of the Second Chance Act of 2007.\\\\n    The BOP is charged with much of the implementation of the \\\\nFirst Step Act. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing a \\\\nnationwide spike in crime, and it is vital that BOP gets this \\\\nimplementation right. The First Step Act required DOJ to \\\\ndevelop a system for BOP to use to assess the risk of \\\\nrecidivism of Federal prisoners and to assign prisoners to \\\\nevidence-based recidivism reduction programs.\\\\n    These programs include literacy programs, occupational \\\\neducation programs, trade skill programs, and substance use \\\\ndisorder programs. Inmates who complete the recidivism \\\\nreduction programming can earn additional time credits, which \\\\nallows them to be placed in home confinement or an RRC earlier \\\\nthan they would have been.\\\\n    This is why I said BOP needs to make sure they get this \\\\nright. We cannot allow criminals to be leaving our prisons \\\\nearly unless we can ensure that they will not reoffend. This \\\\nSubcommittee has examined the implementation First Step Act on \\\\na bipartisan basis since its passage, and I look forward to \\\\ncontinuing that conversation today.\\\\n    However, there is a larger underlying problem that has \\\\npersistently plagued the successful operation of BOP, including \\\\nthe implementation of the First Step Act, and it is something \\\\nthat BOP consistently grapples with--the challenges of low \\\\nstaffing and high attrition rates intensifying the risk in an \\\\nalready hazardous profession.\\\\n    As I mentioned earlier, BOP employs approximately 35,000 \\\\npersonnel across various prisons and facilities throughout the \\\\nU.S. That is a five-percent decline from 37,000 personnel \\\\nemployed in 2020, yet the prison inmate population has not \\\\ndeclined. In fact, it has increased by almost 3,000 inmates.\\\\n    I know that Director Peters is plainly aware of this \\\\npersistent problem, and I look forward to hearing from her \\\\ntoday on the steps that BOP is taking to address the manpower \\\\nproblem at the Bureau.\\\\n    There are a couple of other issues as well that I will \\\\ndiscuss with Director Peters.\\\\n    First, I will discuss the treatment of BOP inmates, in \\\\nparticular, impeachment witness Jason Galanis, which I believe \\\\nhas been politically victimized by the Biden Garland Justice \\\\nDepartment Federal Bureau of Prisons.\\\\n    If we look at this, in February 2023, the CARES--under the \\\\nCARES Act, Galanis applied for home confinement. In March 2023, \\\\nU.S. Probation Office approved the residence for home \\\\nconfinement. In March 2023, the warden at the FPC Pensacola \\\\nalso approved or signed off on the application.\\\\n    It then went to Residential Reentry Management of Long \\\\nBeach, because it was in that sector. On June 9, 2023, RRM Long \\\\nBeach approved the request and contacted SDNY U.S. Attorney&#x27;s \\\\nOffice for their approval.\\\\n    On June 10th, OGR Committee, here, announced that it was \\\\nsubpoenaing Devon Archer, who was a co-conspirator of Jason \\\\nGalanis and is awaiting his prison term. In fact, everybody of \\\\nthe nine partners in that conspiracy, all were indicted and \\\\nwent to prison except for one. One was never indicted, and that \\\\nwas Hunter Biden, although he benefited from that conspiracy \\\\nand was a business partner.\\\\n    Near that June 12, 2023, announcement by the OGR Committee, \\\\nthe U.S. Attorney SDNY, Negar Tekeei, gave, ``strongest \\\\nobjection and threatened to go hard on this.&#x27;&#x27; On June 13, \\\\n2023, BOP announced--excuse me, denied the Galanis application. \\\\nOn June 22, 2023, Galanis was informed of the denial.\\\\n    He then appealed. On August 8, 2023, his appeal to \\\\nPensacola warden on ground was denied on grounds that ``the \\\\namount of time he requested for home confinement `was not \\\\nappropriate.&#x27; &#x27;&#x27; His appeal was denied. That denial, that \\\\nrationale, was not under the CARES Act, that was not \\\\nappropriate to the CARES Act.\\\\n    On September 22, 2023, Galanis appealed the denial to the \\\\nRRM, and on February 8, 2024, we announced we were going to \\\\ninterview Galanis. I will say I thank the Director for \\\\nfacilitating the interview of Mr. Galanis, who had been moved \\\\nto FBC Montgomery, Alabama.\\\\n    The next day, the BOP central sent Galanis his denial of \\\\nhis appeals. The new reason they gave was that the CARES Act \\\\nhad expired, regardless of the fact that he applied for his \\\\nchange in confinement three months before the expiration of the \\\\nCARES Act.\\\\n    Yesterday we had a discussion and I was told that the \\\\nlength of sentence, the high amount of restitution, and that he \\\\nhad violated conditions of release eight years ago when he was \\\\nout on bail. None of those are statutorily consistent with the \\\\nCARES Act as well.\\\\n    The point I am trying to make is this is not unique to Mr. \\\\nGalanis. Perhaps, I don&#x27;t know. I will say that this is a \\\\nproblem.\\\\n    On September--and we moved to this, despite the fact that \\\\nHunter Biden was a key partner in the same crime, DOJ failed to \\\\nhold the President&#x27;s son accountable. Mr. Galanis provided \\\\ntestimony, both transcribed and a hearing before the Oversight \\\\nCommittee as part of the House&#x27;s impeachment inquiry.\\\\n    Mr. Galanis has alleged several instances of mistreatment \\\\nsince his incarceration, including repeated abuse from a BOP \\\\nemployee and DOJ intervening to deny him his home confinement.\\\\n    Second, on May 6, 2024, Representative Gaetz informed the \\\\nHouse of Representatives that BOP Director Peters had denied \\\\nhis request to meet with Dr. Peter Navarro, who at the time was \\\\nin custody. I also joined Mr. Gaetz and wanted to meet with Dr. \\\\nNavarro.\\\\n    On May 9, 2024, I along with Chair Jordan and \\\\nRepresentative Gaetz sent a letter to Director Peters \\\\nrequesting your testimony before the Committee, which is why \\\\nshe is before us today. We are grateful for her being here.\\\\n    Dr. Navarro served a four-month sentence at BOP facility in \\\\nMiami, Florida, after being charged and found guilty of \\\\nrefusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the partisan \\\\nillegitimate House Select Committee on the January 6th attack \\\\non the United States Capitol and was released just last week.\\\\n    Director Peters allegedly denied Representative Gaetz&#x27;s \\\\nrequest because Dr. Navarro was ``too notorious&#x27;&#x27; to meet with \\\\na Member of Congress. We will hear more about that today I am \\\\ncertain.\\\\n    Additionally, I informed the Director yesterday and I want \\\\nto make sure to reiterate today, we have a strong desire to go \\\\nand visit the Danbury, Connecticut, minimum security facility \\\\nand I hope to do so in the next few weeks.\\\\n    I look forward to discussing these issues and more issues \\\\nwith Director Peters, and I again thank her. She&#x27;s been \\\\ncooperative, she has always been communicative with me. We may \\\\nhave disagreements, but we always talk about those.\\\\n    So, with that, I am going to yield back. I will recognize \\\\nMs. McBath for her opening statement.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Thank you, Chair Biggs.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Peters, for coming before us today, and \\\\nwe really appreciate your willingness to answer our questions.\\\\n    The Federal Bureau of Prisons&#x27; significance within the \\\\nFederal criminal justice system contributes to the overall \\\\npublic safety of our country by not only housing individuals \\\\nwho have been convicted of Federal crimes, but also by \\\\nproviding those individuals with the tools and skills they need \\\\nto successfully reenter their communities.\\\\n    In recent years, BOP has faced numerous challenges, \\\\nincluding the sexual abuse of inmates by staff and other \\\\nwidespread employee misconduct, chronic understaffing, numerous \\\\nincidents of violence and inmate deaths, implementation of the \\\\nFirst Step Act, and a crumbling infrastructure.\\\\n    Director Peters, I do want to thank you, though, for the \\\\nsignificant strides that you have made toward addressing each \\\\nof these issues, which existed long before you ever began your \\\\ntenure. However, these problems are still remaining, even if to \\\\na lesser extent.\\\\n    I urge my colleagues to use today&#x27;s hearing to focus on \\\\nwhat this Committee and what Congress can do to ensure that the \\\\nDirector has the tools, resources, and support that she needs \\\\nto address agency deficiencies, maintain the safety and \\\\nwellness of inmates and staff, and prepare inmates for their \\\\nrelease back into society.\\\\n    I am encouraged by Director Peters&#x27; commitment to upholding \\\\nthe highest ethical standards among BOP staff, staff members, \\\\nand her dedicated efforts to change the culture at the BOP. \\\\nHowever, we need to talk about the misconduct among BOP \\\\nemployees, which I understand is a very complex problem \\\\nrequiring increased scrutiny on management and comprehensive \\\\nsolutions with robust oversight and a transparent disciplinary \\\\nprocess.\\\\n    In November 2021, we were shocked to hear about the reports \\\\nat least that 100 BOP employees had been arrested, convicted, \\\\nor sentenced for crimes over a two-year period. If that report \\\\nwasn&#x27;t shocking enough, we soon learned of the disturbing \\\\natrocities occurring at FCI Dublin in California, a Federal \\\\nwomen&#x27;s prison known among inmates and staff as the rape club.\\\\n    Inmates at the facility were subjected to forcible rapes or \\\\nsexual activity, inappropriate sexual contact, and other abuses \\\\nat the hands of staff, made all the worse by acts of \\\\nretaliation for speaking out and coverups by BOP staff and the \\\\nofficials.\\\\n    While our justice system successfully convicted seven \\\\ncorrections officers, including the prison&#x27;s former warden, and \\\\nsentenced the offenders to prison for sexually abusing inmates, \\\\nin April we were made aware of the chaotic future of the \\\\ntransfer of FCI Dublin inmates to various facilities throughout \\\\nthe country following closure of that facility.\\\\n    FCI Dublin is just a sampling of the corruption, of the \\\\nabuse and misconduct that has persisted at BOP for far too \\\\nlong. An alarming number of BOP employees have been convicted \\\\nof an array of crimes, including bribery, obstruction of \\\\njustice, and smuggling contraband, while thousands of other \\\\nemployees have been investigated for misconduct as well.\\\\n    As we all know, employee misconduct of any kind undermines \\\\nthe integrity of the correctional system, jeopardizes the \\\\nsafety and the security of inmates and staff, and erodes public \\\\ntrust in the criminal justice system.\\\\n    That is why I partnered with Representative Kelly Armstrong \\\\nand Senators Jon Ossoff, Dick Durbin, and Mike Braun to \\\\nintroduce the bipartisan Federal Prison Oversight Act, which is \\\\nnow on its way to President&#x27;s desk to be signed into law.\\\\n    Through multiple investigations, we learned that the lack \\\\nof independent oversight led to long-term failures at BOP. That \\\\nperpetrated misconduct contributed to the loss of life, \\\\njeopardized the health and safety of inmates and staff, and \\\\nundermined public safety overall.\\\\n    Our legislation, as soon as it is enacted, will provide \\\\nadditional safeguards and rigorous monitoring systems to \\\\nprevent and eliminate instances of inmate mistreatment. \\\\nEnsuring that inmates are treated with dignity and respect is \\\\nan ethical priority, but it also furthers BOP&#x27;s mission, your \\\\nmission, I believe, as revised by you, Director Peters, by \\\\nencouraging rehabilitation and the successful reintegration of \\\\ninmates into society.\\\\n    The agency remains critically understaffed, though. Neither \\\\nBOP nor Director Peters can be expected to fulfill the agency&#x27;s \\\\nmission without proper staffing. These poor staffing conditions \\\\nwere amplified by the reduction of more than 5,000 positions by \\\\nthe previous administration and budget cuts. Staffing has \\\\nplummeted from over 43,000 employees to approximately 34,000 \\\\nemployees, drastically below critical staffing requirements.\\\\n    Congress, this body, must do all that we can to address the \\\\nstaffing shortages that BOP is undergoing that further compound \\\\nthe challenges of maintaining simple order and safety, \\\\nproviding necessary services, care, treatment, and \\\\nrehabilitative programming and prioritizing staff, their well-\\\\nbeing, and their morale.\\\\n    Director Peters, you have implemented a series of \\\\nstrategies to tackle the staffing crisis. Whether by offering \\\\nretention incentive bonuses or requesting a special pay rate \\\\nfrom the Office of Personnel Management, you have made \\\\ntremendous effort to compete with the private sector and other \\\\nlaw enforcement agencies for correctional officers, healthcare \\\\nprofessionals, and mental health specialists.\\\\n    Despite your best efforts, BOP operates with nearly 8,000 \\\\nfewer correctional officer positions than authorized, forcing \\\\nprisons to use cooks, teachers, nurses, counselors, and other \\\\nemployees to guard the inmates, commonly referred to as \\\\naugmentation.\\\\n    As BOP continues to grapple with staffing shortages, \\\\nparticularly at geographically remote facilities, it is \\\\nexpected that the existing workforce must contend with the \\\\ngrowing use of overtime, augmentation, fatigue, and burnout, \\\\nwhich compromises the safety of inmates and staff, leading to \\\\nheightened tensions and increased instances of violence.\\\\n    The First Step Act, which provides inmates with incentives \\\\nto participate in rehabilitation programs, was signed into law \\\\nwith a primary goal of reducing recidivism.\\\\n    When teachers and counselors are used to serve as guards, \\\\ninmates lose staff resources that would otherwise be focused on \\\\nrehabilitation. Whether mental health or substance abuse \\\\ntreatment, education, or learning new skills, undermining \\\\nopportunities to prepare themselves for return to their \\\\nfamilies and communities is what we are faced with.\\\\n    Without sufficient staffing, BOP cannot fulfill the \\\\nstatute&#x27;s purpose. As many Committee Members know, the First \\\\nStep Act suffered from numerous challenges at the outset, \\\\nbeyond staffing shortages, that slowed various aspects of \\\\nimplementation. Director Peters and BOP should be applauded for \\\\ntheir recent efforts in implementation of the new law.\\\\n    The calculation of inmates earned-time credits is now \\\\nautomated, programming capacity expanded by nearly 35 percent. \\\\nParticipation expanded by 35 percent, and BOP now has 112 \\\\nevidence-based recidivism programs and reduction and productive \\\\nactivities.\\\\n    Director Peters&#x27; leadership should be applauded. Yes, there \\\\nis more to do, but it should be applauded for the significant \\\\nprogrammatic advancements in implementation.\\\\n    There is still room, once again, for improvement. As BOP \\\\nincreases its capacity for inmate participation in First Step \\\\nlaw programming and thus the ability of inmates to reduce their \\\\ntime in custody, BOP must also expand its residential reentry \\\\ncenter network. It is imperative that BOP ensures the prompt \\\\ntransfer of those individuals who have done the work and earned \\\\nthe time credits necessary for their release.\\\\n    Director Peters, please let us know what Congress can do to \\\\nfulfill the promises that we made to these incarcerated \\\\nindividuals by way of the First Step law. With that being said, \\\\nI hope that you are also prepared to tell us what Congress can \\\\ndo to support the bureau&#x27;s efforts to maintain and repair its \\\\naging infrastructure.\\\\n    When you were here last November, your team had identified \\\\na $2 billion deficit that prioritized only those repairs and \\\\nimprovements to facilities that address risks to life and \\\\nsafety. I am interested to hear if that number is still \\\\naccurate today.\\\\n    It is clear that the many issues facing BOP are significant \\\\nand cannot be ignored without jeopardizing public safety. In a \\\\nshort time with the agency, Director Peters has confronted each \\\\nof these issues head on, with an eye always toward promoting \\\\nrehabilitation, successful reentry, and the safety and well-\\\\nbeing of inmates and employees.\\\\n    As I said at the start of last year&#x27;s hearing, there is \\\\nstill much work to be done at BOP. I hope the Subcommittee \\\\ntoday, really focus today on this conversation and what we can \\\\ndo to make certain that the agency is able to fulfill its \\\\nmission with transparency and accountability.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentlelady yields back. We are being called \\\\nto votes. There&#x27;s about three minutes left, so we are going to \\\\ntake a recess until after the votes. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Director.\\\\n    [Recess.]\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government \\\\nSurveillance is called to order. Thank you.\\\\n    At this point the Chair recognizes the gentleman, Ranking \\\\nMember for the entire Committee, Mr. Nadler from New York.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Mr. Chair, when Director Peters appeared before this \\\\nCommittee just seven months ago, I noted the Oversight of the \\\\nFederal Bureau of Prisons is one of the Committee&#x27;s most \\\\ncritical functions. I detailed the numerous deeply rooted \\\\nproblems that Director Peters inherited when she took over as \\\\nBOP director in August 2022, problems such as chronic \\\\nunderstaffing, rampant sexual assault, and inadequate medical \\\\nand mental health treatment, problems that will take time and \\\\nresources to address.\\\\n    Yet, the majority invited Director Peters just months after \\\\nour last BOP oversight hearing, when it will be unrealistic to \\\\nexpect anything more than incremental progress in addressing \\\\nBOP&#x27;s most serious issues. They did so not because they \\\\nactually care about those issues, instead, my Republican \\\\ncolleagues are using this hearing to pursue their longstanding \\\\nand, frankly, inexplicable obsession with Hunter Biden.\\\\n    They have called Director Peters here today primarily to \\\\ncomplain about BOP&#x27;s alleged mistreatment of an incarcerated \\\\nfelon, Jason Galanis, who testified for Republicans at one of \\\\ntheir failed impeachment hearings. Mr. Galanis, who gave that \\\\ntestimony from Federal prison, was a former business associate \\\\nof Hunter Biden who has made all kinds of unfounded allegations \\\\nagainst him.\\\\n    It is no surprise, therefore, that the majority has decided \\\\nto waste precious Committee time and resources attempting to \\\\nbully the BOP into granting Mr. Galanis&#x27; request for \\\\ncompassionate release, even though BOP policy clearly calls for \\\\ndenying this request, as Director Peters will explain.\\\\n    Yes, that is right, in the service of their convicted felon \\\\nPresidential nominee, the majority is using its oversight \\\\nauthority to champion the cause of another convicted felon, one \\\\nwho is serving a sentence of more than 15 years in prison \\\\nbecause he defrauded, among others, an impoverished Native \\\\nAmerican tribe to the tune of over $80 million.\\\\n    I also expect that we will hear concerns today about the \\\\nBOP&#x27;s alleged mistreatment of certain January 6th \\\\ninsurrectionists. I welcome the newly founded interest of my \\\\nRepublican colleagues in conditions at BOP facilities, but I \\\\nhope that their concern will also extend to the thousands of \\\\nother inmates, disproportionately people of color and from low \\\\nincome communities, who do not have the ear of politically \\\\nconnected individuals and elected officials.\\\\n    The BOP reform could be an area of true bipartisan \\\\ncooperation, but only if we recognize that all inmates deserve \\\\nfair and equal treatment.\\\\n    Since Director Peters&#x27; appointment nearly two years ago, \\\\nshe has used her decades of experience to start the long and \\\\narduous process of addressing the staffing shortages that BOP \\\\nhas faced in recent years: The crumbling infrastructure of our \\\\nNation&#x27;s prisons and the rampant sexual and physical abuse of \\\\ninmates at the hands of more than a few bad actors at the BOP.\\\\n    Since she was last here, for example, Director Peters took \\\\nthe drastic and necessary step of permanently closing FCI \\\\nDublin, a women&#x27;s facility plagued by sexual abuse.\\\\n    She has also taken agency-wide measures to punish and \\\\nprevent employee misconduct, and to change staff culture to \\\\nensure that we never again see the type of abuse that we saw at \\\\nDublin and other facilities.\\\\n    Sexual abuse is not the only threat to inmate safety at \\\\nBOP. A February 2024 report by the Office of the Inspector \\\\nGeneral found that systemic operational and managerial failures \\\\ncontributed to hundreds of inmate deaths that occurred between \\\\n2014-2021, the period preceding Director Peters&#x27;s appointment. \\\\nMore than half of those deaths were suicides. Others were \\\\nattributable to lack of medical or mental health treatment, or \\\\nthe presence of illegal drugs and other contraband, issues that \\\\nare compounded by the staffing shortages that have plagued BOP \\\\nsince former President Trump instituted a hiring freeze from \\\\n2017-2019.\\\\n    Last year, Director Peters told us about the steps she has \\\\ntaken to improve employee recruitment, training, and retention, \\\\nto ensure that our Nation&#x27;s prisons are fully staffed with \\\\ntrained, experienced officers who are committed to protecting \\\\nand serving the inmates in their care.\\\\n    I also hope that Director Peters will have an update on \\\\nBOP&#x27;s continued reliance on solitary confinement, otherwise \\\\nknown as restrictive housing, which takes a devastating mental \\\\ntoll on inmates.\\\\n    I do want to note that BOP has continued to make progress \\\\nin another critical area, implementation of the First Step Act, \\\\nin recent years. In recent years BOP has substantially expanded \\\\nthe programming available to inmates and has improved the \\\\nprocess of calculating the time credits inmates earn for \\\\ncompleting rehabilitative programs. This has helped to ensure \\\\nthat more inmates receive the FSA credits that they have \\\\nrightfully earned. As in other issues BOP faces, there is still \\\\nso much more to be done.\\\\n    Due to our reliance on over-incarceration, coupled with a \\\\nrefusal to adequately fund the programs necessary for \\\\nrehabilitation, the demand for these programs still outweighs \\\\ntheir availability. Many inmates who have earned FSA credits \\\\nstill remain incarcerated, even though they have enough credits \\\\nto be released early to a residential reentry center simply \\\\nbecause there is not enough bed space in those residential \\\\nreentry centers.\\\\n    This is a problem that must be addressed, particularly \\\\nsince the evidence shows us that this programming works. \\\\nInmates released early due to FSA earned time credits have a \\\\ndramatically lower recidivism rate compared to inmates who do \\\\nnot participate in these programs.\\\\n    As I said, rigorous oversight of the BOP should be a \\\\nbipartisan issue. The BOP&#x27;s inmates come from all our districts \\\\nand they will be rejoining all our communities when they are \\\\nreleased. They must be treated with dignity and fairness. They \\\\nmust be kept safe. They must be given the tools necessary to \\\\nbecome productive, responsible, hardworking citizens when they \\\\nare released.\\\\n    I look forward to hearing from Director Peters and I hope \\\\nto engage in a productive conversation to ensure that BOP \\\\ncontinues to improve under her leadership.\\\\n    Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Without objection, all other opening statements \\\\nwill be included in the record.\\\\n    We will now introduce today&#x27;s witness, Ms. Colette S. \\\\nPeters. Ms. Peters is the Director of the Federal Bureau of \\\\nPrisons. She was sworn in by the Attorney General on August 2, \\\\n2022. She oversees 122 Bureau of Prisons facilities, six \\\\nregional offices, two staff training centers, and 22 \\\\nresidential reentry management offices.\\\\n    We welcome our witness and thank her for appearing today. \\\\nWe will begin by swearing you in, Director.\\\\n    If you will please rise and raise your right hand.\\\\n    Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the \\\\ntestimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best \\\\nof your knowledge, information, and belief, so help you God?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I do.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The record will reflect that the witness has \\\\nanswered in the affirmative. Thank you.\\\\n    You have been seated, so that is good.\\\\n    Please know that your written testimony will be entered \\\\ninto the record in its entirety. Accordingly, we ask that you \\\\nsummarize your testimony. Keep it to five minutes. I believe \\\\nthere is clock somewhere close where you can see it. You might \\\\nhear me knock a little bit when you get to five minutes, \\\\nindicating to please wrap up.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Peters. We will now proceed under the \\\\nfive-minute rule and go to your first for your opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n\\\\n                 STATEMENT OF COLETTE S. PETERS\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you.\\\\n    Good morning, Chair Biggs, Congresswoman McBath, and the \\\\nMembers of the Subcommittee. I first also want to offer my \\\\nsincere condolences for the loss of your colleague.\\\\n    Yes, is that better? OK, I will start over\\\\n    Thank you. Good morning, Chair Biggs and Congresswoman \\\\nMcBath, and the Members of the Subcommittee.\\\\n    First, I, too, would like to offer my sincere condolences \\\\nfor the loss of your colleague. I am grateful for the \\\\nconversations I had had with her. Her fierce advocacy and \\\\naccountability for the Bureau will be missed.\\\\n    I am honored to be here today representing our employees, \\\\nwho are dedicated and courageous corrections professionals, \\\\ncommitted to our mission and the agency&#x27;s core values of \\\\naccountability, integrity, respect, compassion, and \\\\ncorrectional excellence.\\\\n    Nearly two years ago I took the helm, knowing that it was a \\\\nstruggling agency and that it would take time and resources to \\\\nmake positive change. What I found was that our recruitment and \\\\nretention crisis and our dilapidated facilities are at the core \\\\nof nearly all our challenges. Low staffing levels impact our \\\\ninstitutions&#x27; operations, including safety and security, \\\\nmedical care, education, programming, and treatment. So, our \\\\npriorities are clear: Recruitment, retention, employee \\\\nwellness, and maintenance and repair.\\\\n    Fortunately, we are making progress with our recruitment \\\\nand retention crisis. When I joined the Bureau, we had 986 new \\\\nhires for that entire calendar year. Already this year we have \\\\nonboarded over 1,400. The even better news is that we are now \\\\nhiring more people than are leaving the agency.\\\\n    Yet, challenges remain. The bottom line is we simply do not \\\\npay our people enough. Our average base salary of $55,000 for \\\\nnew officers is simply not competitive. So, even when we \\\\nonboard people, some leave for better pay.\\\\n    As an example, at our facility in Massachusetts one of our \\\\nofficers left because they got a better offer, with better pay, \\\\nat the local grocery store.\\\\n    Ads in New York city offer corrections positions that pay \\\\n$130,000 after three years, where our Federal officers makes \\\\ntens of thousands of dollars less.\\\\n    Our staffing crises are very expensive, as we rely on \\\\novertime, augmentation, and incentives to keep our prisons \\\\noperational. Last year alone we paid more than $128 million in \\\\nincentives and spent more than $315 million in overtime.\\\\n    I also want to note the human cost of overtime and the \\\\naugmentation, which we know are incredibly difficult on our \\\\ncorrections professionals, both their physical and their mental \\\\nhealth. So, incentives like augmentation, recruitment and \\\\nretention incentives, and overtime should only be short-term \\\\nfixes.\\\\n    To solve our long-term problem, we are working closely with \\\\nthe Department and OPM to create a special salary rate for \\\\nemployees in our institutions. The request, if approved, will \\\\nrequire your support. We estimate the need for an additional \\\\nhundreds of millions of dollars per year.\\\\n    Our dilapidated infrastructure also affects our mission. It \\\\nimpedes our ability to offer safe, normal, and more humane \\\\nenvironments for our employees and those in our custody. That \\\\nnumber is now over $3 billion in maintenance and repair needs. \\\\nThat tells you our infrastructure is crumbling.\\\\n    We have created a four-year plan to attack the most serious \\\\nrepairs first, and are preparing our 10- and 15-year plans.\\\\n    Before I conclude I want to celebrate the passage of the \\\\nFederal Prison Oversight Act. This act enhances our ongoing \\\\ncollaboration and good work with the Office of the Inspector \\\\nGeneral. I share the Inspector General&#x27;s and your commitment to \\\\ngreater accountability and oversight and have said so from day \\\\none on the job.\\\\n    I would like to thank Representative McBath for her \\\\nleadership on this legislation and her acknowledgment on the \\\\nHouse floor of our brave men and women, and the need for \\\\nadditional resources to improve environments for them and those \\\\nin our care and custody.\\\\n    I also want to thank every Member of this Committee who \\\\nsupported this legislation.\\\\n    As I have mentioned publicly, we will need more resources \\\\nto implement this act efficiently on a couple of fronts.\\\\n    The legislation limits the Bureau&#x27;s use of augmentation. \\\\nWhile I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment of limiting \\\\naugmentation, today in the midst of our crisis, without \\\\naugmentation we will need to mandate more overtime, which will \\\\nnot only cost tens of millions of more dollars but, again, I \\\\nwill note the human cost, the physical and mental wear and tear \\\\nof our employees.\\\\n    We will also need to hire additional employees to \\\\neffectively respond to the additional oversight and make that \\\\nmeaningful, long-lasting change.\\\\n    All of us at the Bureau, including our national union, look \\\\nforward to working with you closely to ensure that we have the \\\\nneeded resources to uphold our end of the bargain.\\\\n    As I have said before, I believe in the government&#x27;s \\\\naccountability, transparency, and the importance of oversight.\\\\n    Thank you for your time. I stand ready to answer your \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Peters follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Director Peters.\\\\n    Now, we will proceed under the five-minute rule with \\\\nquestioning. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, \\\\nMr. Gaetz, for five minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Director Peters, do you remember telling me that \\\\nPeter Navarro was too notorious when I wanted to interview him \\\\nduring his incarceration?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, we had a long conversation about \\\\nyour desire to have us help facilitate Mr. Strand to appear on \\\\nyour podcast.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Nope, nope, no, no. This is Navarro.\\\\n    So, I am asking about Mr. Navarro. Do you remember telling \\\\nme he was too notorious?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Oh, sorry. Congressman, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. OK. So, all right, I want to get into how you \\\\ndetermined that an inmate is too notorious for an interview or \\\\nnot too notorious for an interview. What is the standard that \\\\nyou applied?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, Congressman, I think it is really important \\\\nfor the Committee to understand that the request was about him \\\\nappearing on a podcast. It wasn&#x27;t about facilitating a meeting \\\\nwith the two of you, which my office followed up and said we \\\\nwould clearly facilitate.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Correct.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. There is only one avenue, as we talked about, \\\\nin our policy around being able to appear on a podcast, and \\\\nthat is our media policy. You, with your personal podcasts, \\\\nthat is not official need.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. No. No. It is my official podcast.\\\\n    So, the Members of Congress do podcasts to function as \\\\nvideo newsletters to tell the American people what is going on. \\\\nSo, I wanted to interview Navarro. You said he was too \\\\nnotorious. You have acknowledged that was the basis.\\\\n    So, I want to know now what test you apply to determine \\\\nthat someone is or is not too notorious?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Again, Congressman, while I shared that \\\\ninformation with you in a one-on-one briefing, the crux of the \\\\ndenial was that we were not able to help facilitate an \\\\nincarcerated individual to appear on a podcast.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. No, no, no. That wasn&#x27;t what you said. You said \\\\nit was--you acknowledged it was this notoriety factor. The \\\\nreason I ask is because Michael Avenatti gave an interview from \\\\nFederal prison.\\\\n    So, I guess, why is it that Michael Avenatti is authorized \\\\nto do an interview from Federal prison but Peter Navarro isn&#x27;t?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, I met with you to be as helpful as \\\\npossible to discuss--\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. That wasn&#x27;t helpful.\\\\n    No, because here is what it looks like. OK. You have \\\\nacknowledged that the reason you didn&#x27;t let me interview \\\\nNavarro was because you said he was too notorious. Then, I have \\\\nspent more than a minute trying to get you to explain what the \\\\ntest is for that notoriety, and you can&#x27;t explain that. You \\\\njust keep on going back to, well, we couldn&#x27;t facilitate you \\\\nand we were trying to be helpful.\\\\n    That wasn&#x27;t helpful. When you have standards that are \\\\nsubject to just any interpretation you want, then you carry \\\\nwith the entire Bureau the belief that you guys are just being \\\\narbitrary. Because when John Gotti is allowed to do an \\\\ninterview from the Federal prison and Peter Navarro isn&#x27;t, it \\\\nis hard to ascertain how Gotti would be less notorious.\\\\n    It just sort of looks like it animates the concern that you \\\\nheard expressed by the Chair, whether it&#x27;s Galanis, or Navarro, \\\\nor Bannon, or whomever, that you guys are trying to make it \\\\nharder on people who are expressing views that you don&#x27;t \\\\nparticularly like.\\\\n    So, that is going to be a problem. We are going to have to \\\\nput into law, or oversight, or something, the ability to get to \\\\nthese people because we are not going to accept just you are \\\\nmaking a determination that Avenatti is not too notorious, but \\\\nNavarro is.\\\\n    So, you hear the Chair say in his opening remarks that we \\\\nwant to go to Danbury prison in Connecticut. We want to go \\\\nthere to see Mr. Bannon.\\\\n    So, is there going to be any problem in the next few weeks \\\\napproving a visit with the Chair of this Committee to go to \\\\nDanbury?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. As the Congressman and I talked about during a \\\\none-on-one conversation yesterday, and as I will say to the \\\\nCommittee, we will be happy to review that request and make \\\\nthat accommodation as you submit that request to the Office of \\\\nLegislative Affairs.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. OK. I appreciate the commitment to review it. \\\\nAre you committing to approve it?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, those approvals actually happen \\\\nthrough the Office of Legislative Affairs. I can&#x27;t foresee an \\\\nissue with the approval of that.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. They work for you. This is the Legislative \\\\naffairs you are testifying before your Oversight Subcommittee. \\\\nSo, why don&#x27;t you just tell us that you will approve our trip \\\\nto go to Danbury?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That approval rests with the Department. We \\\\nhave a longstanding process of reviewing--\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. You lead the Department. There is not some other \\\\nperson. You are the head of the Department, why can&#x27;t you just \\\\nsay we can go?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We have a longstanding process of those \\\\nrequests being reviewed by the Department. I will encourage my \\\\nteam to work closely with the Department in reviewing that \\\\nrequest.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. That is just a total non-answer.\\\\n    This is what we get, Mr. Chair. This is what we get, \\\\narbitrary standards, non-answers. Frankly, if we continue to \\\\nfund it and tolerate it, that is all we are going to get.\\\\n    So, I would encourage some robust oversight here. I would \\\\nnot want to be in a position where you guys denied this \\\\nrequest.\\\\n    Finally, I would just say with my final few seconds, Mr. \\\\nBiggs and I were in really one of the most impressive prisons \\\\nin the world, CECOT, in El Salvador. There was concern \\\\nexpressed by the Minister of Justice there that the Mexican \\\\nmafia is operating out of our prisons, and they are able to \\\\nconduct criminal enterprises and use communication \\\\ncapabilities. So, I hope you would just take for the record \\\\nperhaps a review of what the Mexican mafia&#x27;s activities are. I \\\\nwould love to hear about it.\\\\n    Finally, just want to echo all, everyone on the Committee&#x27;s \\\\nvery thoughtful and appropriate remarks about our colleague \\\\nSheila Jackson Lee. It only seems appropriate to offer that \\\\nafter the gavel has been rung because that is when Ms. Jackson \\\\nLee did some of her most outstanding work.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. She and I talked about that frequently, so.\\\\n    The Chair recognizes now the gentlelady Ms. McBath.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Thank you, Chair.\\\\n    Director Peters, the grotesque actions at FCI Dublin is an \\\\nextreme example of why every person needs oversight, every \\\\nprison needs oversight. I back its closure 110 percent. Closing \\\\nthe facility was the first step in a long and harrowing \\\\nprocess.\\\\n    The women at that prison remain in need of supervision, \\\\nprotection, and a sense of what their futures would look like. \\\\nThey have already endured so much. It is your job to ensure \\\\nthat no additional harm comes to them.\\\\n    Many of these women held at FCI Dublin have family members \\\\nand loved ones who are concerned for their physical safety and \\\\ntheir emotional well-being.\\\\n    What steps were taken to screen for histories of misconduct \\\\namong the temporary staff BOP brought to FCI Dublin to \\\\nfacilitate the transfer of adults in custody?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you, Congresswoman.\\\\n    There was a review by the regional directors to ensure that \\\\nthe people we were sending to have additional eyes and ears in \\\\nthat facility during that closure were the appropriate people.\\\\n    We also brought in additional members from the regional \\\\noffice to have that oversight as well. Safety and security of \\\\nthose women, and fear of even perceived retaliation during that \\\\nmove was top of line for us.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Thank you.\\\\n    What oversight is occurring to ensure that women are being \\\\ntreated humanely during their transfer process?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, on a variety of levels. We sent out clear \\\\nmessages to the wardens that they would have direct eyes and \\\\nears in watching these women as they arrived in their receiving \\\\ninstitutions to ensure that they had the medical care, the \\\\nmental healthcare, access to counsel, access to their family. \\\\nYou are right, we were worried about their families as well.\\\\n    We also have an individual that has been a liaison with our \\\\nSAFER teams from the department, from the Office of the Deputy \\\\nAttorney General. She, too, is keeping watch on these \\\\nindividuals. So, we have someone in central office paying \\\\nattention.\\\\n    I also had the opportunity to visit a group of these women \\\\nwho have been transferred to our facility, our SeaTac facility \\\\nin Washington, and talked to them directly to ensure that their \\\\ntransition was going smoothly.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Did BOP evaluate every woman&#x27;s eligibility for \\\\nearly release or release to community placements with \\\\nconsideration for good time credit, and also the First Step Act \\\\ncredit, and the Second Chance Act before assigning them to \\\\nanother facility?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congresswoman, we did. In fact, at the time \\\\nthat we decided to close the facility there were over 600 women \\\\nat that facility. At the point of moving them out we had 518.\\\\n    So, a substantial number of them were able to go to the \\\\ncommunity based on those earned time credits or other standing.\\\\n    Also, the women that I mentioned that were housed at \\\\nSeaTac, those were individuals that have less than five months \\\\nremaining on their sentence. We wanted them to be as close to \\\\ntheir releasing facility as possible during the latter part of \\\\ntheir sentence.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Finally, what efforts were made to ensure that \\\\nother BOP facilities had the capacity to receive those \\\\nindividuals that were transferred from FCI Dublin?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Yes. We did a careful review of capacity and \\\\ntheir ability to safely absorb them. Felt comfortable with the \\\\ninstitutions that we had chosen that they were able to safely \\\\nabsorb them and provide them the appropriate treatment, \\\\nprogramming, and medical and mental health.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. We have also been kind of concerned about the \\\\nfact that we understand that some of the individuals that were \\\\ntransferred were transferred very far away from their \\\\ncommunities and far away from their families, with no \\\\nnotification of those family members as to where their family \\\\nand those individuals were being transferred to.\\\\n    I, myself, also having the murderer of my son&#x27;s child \\\\nactually placed in Federal prison as well, I will tell you our \\\\nrights were violated because that gentleman--I will call him a \\\\ngentleman--actually was transferred. We never knew anything \\\\nabout it. I found out from the media that he had been \\\\ntransferred out of the State of Florida to another facility.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you, Congresswoman. I know you and I have \\\\ntalked about that unfortunate incident. I was just, again, \\\\nsorry that happened to you and your family.\\\\n    The families were also a concern of ours in this move. For \\\\nsafety and security reasons we can&#x27;t give advance notice on \\\\nwhen we are moving adults in custody ever, not just the \\\\ntemporary closure of a facility but even the daily moves that \\\\nwe make, which is why we made sure that they have access and \\\\nability to reach out to their families once they arrived at \\\\ntheir receiving institution.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I yield back my time.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentlewoman yields. The Chair now recognizes \\\\nthe gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Tiffany.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you.\\\\n    Director Peters, the Ranking Member said it very good in \\\\nher, very well in her opening statement that everyone should be \\\\ntreated with dignity and respect. I am assuming that applies to \\\\nall inmates. Is that correct?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Derek Chauvin in a Tucson facility was stabbed \\\\n22 times while he was copying documents. What happened?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, excuse me, I won&#x27;t be able to \\\\nspeak to the details of that situation for obvious reasons. I \\\\nwill tell you that the safety of all individuals in our custody \\\\nis what we do every day. That is our mission. That is our \\\\nfocus.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. So, the gang member that stabbed him 22 times \\\\nseems now to have full access to being able to, for example, \\\\ncopy documents, stuff like that, while Mr. Chauvin is not \\\\nallowed that privilege currently.\\\\n    Why would there be disparate treatment like that?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to speak to the \\\\nspecifics of Mr. Chauvin&#x27;s incarceration or the assailant.\\\\n    What I can tell you is that we have experts who make \\\\nhousing determinations and placements to ensure that people are \\\\nsafe and secure, both the individuals that were assaulted and \\\\nthe assailant.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Are you aware that Jason Galanis reported to a \\\\nBOP chaplain that he was the victim of repeated incidents of \\\\nsexual harassment at the hands of BOP staff?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I am familiar with Mr. Galanis&#x27; allegations, \\\\nyes.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Is that staff member who assaulted Mr. \\\\nGalanis, is he still working for BOP?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Again, that is an ongoing investigation. I \\\\nwouldn&#x27;t be able to speak to the alleged individual&#x27;s \\\\ncircumstances right now.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Mr. Chair, this is really one of, I have been \\\\nhere four short years, this is really one of the frustrating \\\\nthings. When people come before this Committee, whether it is \\\\nthe FBI, the Department of Justice, whomever, we rarely get \\\\nanswers. You can see why the American people are losing faith \\\\nin some of our institutions when we can&#x27;t even get answers to \\\\nsome of these things.\\\\n    I just want to close with this question, Director Peters.\\\\n    In Wisconsin recently we had a staff member that was killed \\\\nat the Lincoln Hills Juvenile Facility. I don&#x27;t expect you to \\\\nknow the details in regard to it. A judge restricted use of \\\\nrestraints for violent youth due to an appeal by the ACLU.\\\\n    Do you ever run into the same problem where a result of the \\\\nactions of the courts that they restrict the ability to protect \\\\nstaff?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, I am not aware of any examples.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. So, you believe your staff is well protected?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I am sorry, I am not understanding the \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Do you think your staff is relatively safe in \\\\nthe environment that they work in?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I think that the important thing that we do \\\\nevery day is working to train them with make sure they have the \\\\ntools and the resources they need to operate safe and secure \\\\nprisons.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. So, Mr. Chair, thank you for giving me the \\\\nlatitude where I am morphing into a State issue, but it is very \\\\ndisappointing now, a staff member, a very good staff member was \\\\nkilled in a facility that I live in, that lives in my district \\\\nas a result of a judge who took actions that allowed the \\\\ninmates to run the asylum.\\\\n    With that, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman yields.\\\\n    The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the whole \\\\nCommittee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    In April 2023, GAO placed management of the Federal prison \\\\nsystem on its high risk list, in part due to staffing \\\\nchallenges. In which positions are vacancies most acute?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We are focused mostly on our correctional \\\\nofficers.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. What is your short- and long-term plan to \\\\nincrease the number of correctional officers to meet the needs \\\\nof the system?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    We have done so many things:\\\\n\\\\n     LWe have used every incentive that we have at our \\\\nfingerprints, both recruitment and retention incentives.\\\\n\\\\n     LWe have changed how we are marketing and trying \\\\nto hire our correctional officers.\\\\n\\\\n     LWe increased correctional officers&#x27; base salary \\\\nby $2,000.\\\\n\\\\n     LWe waived the maximum entry--age entry, excuse \\\\nme, from 37-39.\\\\n\\\\n     LWe pay a $1,000 recruitment bonus to any employee \\\\nthat successfully recruits someone and brings them onto the \\\\nBureau.\\\\n\\\\n     LAs of May 2024, we received direct hire authority \\\\nfor our correctional officers nationwide, which has proven very \\\\nsuccessful.\\\\n\\\\n    Then, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I think the \\\\nprimary focus is really that base salary and working with the \\\\nDepartment and OPM for a special salary rate.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you.\\\\n    According to GAO, some of the staffing concerns relate to \\\\ndifficulty recruiting, while other challenges relate to what \\\\nthe GAO calls ``the growing use of overtime and augmentation.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    What are you doing to reduce overtime and, specifically, \\\\nthe use of mandatory overtime?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you, Congressman.\\\\n    As I said in my opening remarks, in wears and tears. As I \\\\nwalk through the halls of my institutions, while our \\\\ncorrectional officers are so proud to tell me of the work that \\\\nthey are doing, they also share how exhausted they are. It is \\\\ndriven by overtime and augmentation.\\\\n    So, our focus to reduce that is hiring, is to get our \\\\ninstitutions fully staffed.\\\\n    I just visited our facility in Michigan, Milan, Michigan, \\\\nwhere it is nearly fully staffed. Just the tenor and tone of \\\\nthat institution was so different because they weren&#x27;t buried \\\\nwith overtime and augmentation.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Would adjusting the pay scale or GS scale of \\\\ncorrectional officer, correctional officers upward across the \\\\nboard be more advantageous to BOP in retaining staff and cost \\\\nsavings than paying millions of dollars in overtime?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, any way that we can pay our people \\\\nmore, will actually in the long run cost less than overtime, \\\\nyes.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you.\\\\n    You have made it clear that you will not tolerate employee \\\\nmisconduct of any kind, and that this issue is among your \\\\nhighest priorities. What specific steps are you taking in this \\\\nregard?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So many. This is something that we have focused \\\\non out of the gate.\\\\n    When I first started as director two years ago we had under \\\\n30 people who worked in the Office in Internal Affairs. We now \\\\nhave almost 150 individuals. We have realigned their reporting \\\\nauthority, so they report directly to headquarters, not up \\\\nthrough the warden, to remove any perceived or real barriers to \\\\nthat.\\\\n    We are working very closely with the Office of the \\\\nInspector General. I personally meet with him quarterly. Our \\\\nteams meet regularly to ensure that the backlog and the \\\\ncommunication is wide open there as well.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. In what way is the Department of Justice \\\\nassisting your efforts to root out and address employee \\\\nmisconduct?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. They have been incredibly helpful. The Deputy \\\\nAttorney General herself and I have met directly with the U.S. \\\\nAttorneys to talk about the importance of prosecuting employee \\\\nmisconduct out of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. They have been \\\\nvery receptive to that.\\\\n    I have met with U.S. Attorneys regularly in the last two \\\\nyears, multiple times in the last two years to share that very \\\\nsentiment.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you.\\\\n    In recent months there have been a series of reports \\\\ndocumenting BOP&#x27;s continued widespread use of restrictive \\\\nhousing, with devastating and deadly results. What steps is BOP \\\\ntaking to restrict the use of restrictive housing?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. This is an area where we still have room for \\\\nadvancement.\\\\n    I have a long history of reforming restrictive housing. As \\\\nI was talking to the union earlier, it is a tool we will always \\\\nhave inside our institutions, but we need to limit it even more \\\\ndramatically. It has dropped slightly since I started.\\\\n    Probably the biggest thing that we have in the works is we \\\\nhave been working closely with the national union to revise our \\\\npolicy around discipline for those in our custody. As it is \\\\nwritten right now, it reduces the sanction time in restrictive \\\\nhousing by almost 84 percent.\\\\n    So, once that is passed, I think we will see substantial \\\\nchange.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. What has BOP done to address the high rate of \\\\nsuicide in restrictive housing?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, we have mandated that individuals are \\\\ndouble celled in restrictive housing to ensure that they have \\\\nhuman contact while they are in restrictive housing.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you.\\\\n    Before becoming Director of BOP, you often spoke about the \\\\nharms of solitary confinement and the benefits of alternatives \\\\nto the practice. What are the benefits that you see in \\\\nalternatives to solitary confinement where people are separated \\\\nfrom the general population but are provided real and effective \\\\nout-of-cell programming and services?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We have--\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    You may go ahead and answer the question.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    The research is very clear: The more normal and humane \\\\nenvironments that we provide for the adults in custody, the \\\\nsafer they are, the less wear and tear on them as well as our \\\\nemployees.\\\\n    So, we have many alternatives to restrictive housing that \\\\nwe have engaged in over the last couple of years, including our \\\\nStep Down Units, our Reentry Reintegration Units, and our GROW \\\\nUnits, which actually prevent people from actually going to \\\\nrestrictive housing.\\\\n    So, we are taking lots of steps to see those numbers drop \\\\nbecause we know very clearly the negative impacts of \\\\nrestrictive housing on those individuals.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Director. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman yields back. At this time, I \\\\nacknowledge that the gentleman from South Dakota--\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. North Dakota.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Sorry about that. The gentleman from North \\\\nDakota, Mr. Armstrong, would like to be waived on. Without \\\\nobjection? Seeing none, OK. Chair now recognizes for his five \\\\nminutes of questioning, the gentleman from--excuse me, the \\\\nChair of the entire Committee from Ohio, Mr. Jordan.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. I thank the Chair. Director, how many Federal \\\\ninmates were released to home confinement under CARES Act?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We had about 35,000 released under the CARES \\\\nAct.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Thirty-five thousand?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Oh, excuse me, 35,000 is the number under FSA \\\\nEarned Time Credits. Under CARES Act, it was--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Thirteen?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thirteen thousand--13,204.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Thirteen? That&#x27;s what I thought.\\\\n    Thirteen thousand. On February 4, 2023, Jason Galanis after \\\\nserving approximately 40 percent of his sentence applied for \\\\nhome confinement. The very next month, the probation office \\\\napproved that. You&#x27;re familiar with that, right?\\\\n    Also, the very next month, March 2023, the Pensacola warden \\\\napproved--and then on June 9th, the Residential Reentry \\\\nManagement Center also approved Mr. Galanis for home \\\\nconfinement under the CARES Act. Then, four days later, the \\\\nBoard of Prison denied it. Who made the decision to deny that?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. The denial came out of the Residential Reentry \\\\nManagement Office.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. After they approved it, four days later, they \\\\nchanged their mind?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, the Chair and I spoke yesterday. I think \\\\nthere&#x27;s some confusion around approvals and referrals. The \\\\nwarden has the ability to refer. Probation has the requirement \\\\nto confirm that his housing option in the community is proper. \\\\nThat still doesn&#x27;t approve a home confinement placement. The \\\\nfinal decision rests with the Residential Reentry Management \\\\nOffice.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. They told Mr. Galanis on the 9th that \\\\neverything was fine. Then on the 13th, they changed. Why?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That is not my understanding. The Residential \\\\nReentry Management Office did a thorough review of his case and \\\\nconcluded that he was for a variety of indicators would not be \\\\na good candidate for home confinement.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The Residential Reentry Management Center on \\\\nJune 9th approved Mr. Galanis&#x27; request for home confinement and \\\\nthen reached out to the Southern District of New York where he \\\\nwas prosecuted. Is that what happened?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That&#x27;s not my understanding. My understanding \\\\nis since he had more than five years on his sentence, it was \\\\npractice for the Residential Reentry Management Office to reach \\\\nout to the U.S.--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Anyone else get CARES Act release and home \\\\nconfinement under the CARES Act who had more than five years \\\\nleft on their sentence?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I can&#x27;t answer that question.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. I can. David McMaster did. David McMaster did \\\\nand sentenced for fraud, similar to Mr. Galanis, had 188 months \\\\nsentence and was given home confinement under the CARES Act.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We look at each case individually. I am \\\\nconfident that Mr. Galanis--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK. So, this is what I&#x27;m getting at. What was \\\\nthe reason--whether it was an approval then a denial, what was \\\\nthe reason for the denial?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, it was a handful of reasons. We look at the \\\\ntotality of the circumstances when we make--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. When you say we, who ultimately makes the \\\\ndecision? Does that rest with you?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. No, sir. I do not review these.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Can you overrule it?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. This is the Residential--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Can you overrule what happens at the \\\\nResidential Reentry Management Center?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I have never overruled one of their decisions.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Never? OK. Then what were the factors that \\\\nmade this determination?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, the factors included the fact that in a \\\\nprevious incarceration cycle, he violated the conditions of his \\\\nsupervisory lease by texting a potential witness. His bond was \\\\nultimately revoked. His role in the instant offense as a leader \\\\nand organizer was outlined in the presentencing we support. As \\\\nwas mentioned earlier, he owed over 80 million dollars in \\\\nrestitution. He had more than ten victims and more than five \\\\nyears left on his sentence.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. How many were turned down? The people who \\\\napplied under the CARES Act, you gave approval to 13,204. How \\\\nmany were denied?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I don&#x27;t have that number but happy to look into \\\\nit and get it back--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Is it a big number? Is it a small number? \\\\nWhat&#x27;s the number?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, I wouldn&#x27;t venture a guess under \\\\noath. I will tell you that toward the end of CARES Act, the \\\\nnumber of requests that came in I&#x27;m told tripled as the \\\\npopulation learned the CARES Act was expiring. So, I know at \\\\nthe time of his request, the numbers were very high.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Did the fact that the House Oversight \\\\nCommittee subpoenaed Mr. Galanis&#x27; business partner have any \\\\nweight on the decision to deny his request?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. No.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. You&#x27;re confident of that?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I have no evidence to suggest that the \\\\nResidential Reentry Management Office would have taken that \\\\ninto consideration. That would&#x27;ve been outside BOP policy.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Because June 9th, they basically told him, \\\\nOK, it looks good. On June 13th, they deny it. Anything happen \\\\nin between there that could&#x27;ve influenced the decision?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Not that I am aware of.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. That&#x27;s when the subpoena was sent to his \\\\nbusiness partner on June 12th. We actually think that probably \\\\nhad some impact on the decision to deny his request given that \\\\nother people--similar crime, similar sentence were, in fact, \\\\napproved like Mr. McMaster. You&#x27;re saying that had nothing to \\\\ndo with it?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Correct.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. You don&#x27;t know how many were turned down?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. No, but happy to find that number and get it \\\\nback to you.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Mr. Galanis is nonviolent. His crime was \\\\nnonviolent. Any people who were in for a violent offense were \\\\nthen released under the CARES Act?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, I am confident that Mr. Galanis&#x27; \\\\ncase was handled within existing BOP policy, and I am aware \\\\nthat any part of his application was denied other than the \\\\nmerits that I just described to you.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK. Well, the timeline doesn&#x27;t seem to add up \\\\nto what you just described there. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Mr. Chair?\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Yes?\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to enter \\\\ninto the record a letter from DOJ explaining that Mr. Galanis \\\\nwas not eligible for home confinement under the CARES Act \\\\nconsistent with department policy because of the length of time \\\\non his sentence and the nature of his conduct, which as we know \\\\ninvolved conning shareholders, investors, and a tribal entity \\\\nout of tens of millions of dollars.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Without objection. The Chair now recognized the \\\\ngentleman from Alabama, Mr. Moore.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms. Peters, thank you for \\\\nbeing here today. On December 21, 2018, President Trump signed \\\\nthe First Step Act, and it was sentencing reform. I understand \\\\nthat mandatory sentences were reduced, in some cases from 20-15 \\\\nyears, depending on the crime, of course. Did you say 35,000 \\\\npeople were released as a result of the First Step Act?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That&#x27;s correct.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. The safety valve program which also restricts or \\\\nallows judges in nonviolent crimes to allow criminals or at \\\\nleast people who have been convicted a little earlier release. \\\\nHas that been helpful in lowering prison population and \\\\ncrowding?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Our prison population is continuing to climb \\\\never so slightly even though we have some of these tools at our \\\\ndisposal.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. In Alabama--I think we spoke about this last \\\\ntime. I&#x27;m a proponent of prison reform and certainly sentencing \\\\nreform. We have a prison in Alabama that actually teaches \\\\nskills.\\\\n    So, when the inmates come out, they&#x27;re certified welders, \\\\ndiesel mechanics, and all the above. The recidivism rate has \\\\nlowered dramatically. So, I would encourage us to look at those \\\\nkind of programs.\\\\n    Concerning Mr. Galanis, I didn&#x27;t realize that he had eight \\\\nbusiness partners. I think Hunter Biden had eight business \\\\npartners, and Mr. Galanis was one of the eight that got \\\\nsentenced. Hunter did not get charged with anything is my \\\\nunderstanding. That&#x27;s the problem and we talked about this with \\\\nMerrick Garland.\\\\n    Sometimes it seems like certain people, justice is not \\\\ntruly blind, and that&#x27;s been a concern for us. Certainly, with \\\\nMr. Galanis being a partner with Mr. Biden and us trying to get \\\\ninformation concerning the impeachment process, you understand \\\\nhow we&#x27;re concerned when he&#x27;s denied after he&#x27;s approved, and \\\\nthen all of a sudden, we send a subpoena and they go, oh, by \\\\nthe way, you&#x27;ve been denied? You think in any way that \\\\nsometimes politics gets into the part of the prisons?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, no. We are to uphold the letter of \\\\nthe law and our policies. Politics should not be taken into \\\\naccount when we&#x27;re making those decisions.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. Well, under the First Step Act which we just \\\\ntalked a little about, certain incarcerated individuals are \\\\nmeant to be able to earn time credits for participating in \\\\nrecidivism reduction programs. Our productive activities which \\\\ncan be later applied toward early release, we&#x27;ve been informed \\\\nby the BOP that it is not processing--or at this time, it&#x27;s not \\\\nprocessing these earned credits, leaving inmates, including \\\\nJason Galanis in the dark regarding his status through the \\\\nFirst Step Act. What is the BOP doing to rectify the \\\\nimplementation of the First Step Act to ensure that individuals \\\\nlike Mr. Galanis are receiving proper treatment under the law?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, the automation of the earned time credits \\\\nhas proven very effective. It really allows for transparency \\\\nwith the adults in custody now. So, now they know they have a \\\\nprojected date on if they stay in program, if they continue to \\\\nengage in positive behavior that those earned time credits are \\\\nthere.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. So, why are we keeping the prisoners in the dark \\\\non these? I think in some ways, that&#x27;s a carrot that we can \\\\nsay, hey, at this point, we can move you along a little--you&#x27;re \\\\nmaking great progress. We always want to encourage folks who \\\\nare trying to make the effort to correct their path. Any reason \\\\nwhy we&#x27;re keeping certain inmates or inmates in the dark on \\\\nthis?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Congressman, you and I are aligned on this. I&#x27;m \\\\na behaviorist by training. It&#x27;s absolutely a carrot which is \\\\nwhy we have changed the practice now. So, now they&#x27;re not in \\\\nthe dark. Now we&#x27;re doing the automated projected earned time \\\\ncredits, and they&#x27;re able to see that carrot--\\\\n    Mr. Moore. When did you all begin that?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We have been working on automated time credits \\\\nfor over a year. It&#x27;s been in the last few months that we&#x27;ve \\\\nbeen doing the projected earned time credits.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. OK. To your knowledge based on participation of \\\\nthese programs facilitated under the First Step Act--yes, First \\\\nStep Act--how many earned credits does Mr. Galanis--how much \\\\nhas he accumulated?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I do not have that answer. We&#x27;re happy to look \\\\ninto it and get back to you.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. OK. Thank you. With that, Mr. Chair, I yield \\\\nback.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The Chair now recognizes Representative Dean.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. Thank you, Chair Biggs. Thank you for holding \\\\nthis hearing. Thank you, Representative McBath, for your \\\\nleading role here.\\\\n    In the absence of our colleague, I just want to take a \\\\ncouple seconds to also offer my thoughts and sympathy \\\\nespecially to Sheila Jackson Lee&#x27;s family and her staff, her \\\\nable staff, both here and in Houston. I feel so lucky that I \\\\nhad the chance to serve with her for 5\\\\\\\\1/2\\\\\\\\ years on this \\\\nCommittee and on this Subcommittee on crime. What a force.\\\\n    The hardest working woman in Congress, everybody knows \\\\nthat. There wasn&#x27;t an issue she didn&#x27;t speak about. So, is \\\\nalready dearly missed, but her 30 years will live on for a long \\\\ntime. If I could begin.\\\\n    Thank you very much, Director Peters, for being here. The \\\\nBOP reports that 45 percent of Federal prisoners have mental \\\\nhealth or behavioral problems. More than 30 percent struggle \\\\nwith substance use disorder. That&#x27;s in line what I have heard \\\\nwhen I was State Representative in Pennsylvania and when I \\\\nspoke to Secretary Laurel Harry of the Pennsylvania Department \\\\nof Corrections.\\\\n    She estimated that roughly 35 percent of the people within \\\\nher care struggle with mental health. At least 15 percent \\\\nsuffer from serious mental health problems. She said a \\\\nmajority, perhaps as high as 70 percent, grapple with addition \\\\nsubstance use disorder.\\\\n    Clearly, our inmates need comprehensive support because \\\\nthey are coming home. They will reenter our society, and we \\\\nwant that to be as successful as possible for them, for their \\\\nfamilies, and also to reduce recidivism. So, addition to mental \\\\nhealth, what are the top things that the Bureau is doing or can \\\\ndo, especially if you had the resources, to aid inmates with \\\\nmental health issues and substance issues?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you, Congressman. You&#x27;re absolutely \\\\nright. The numbers that you mention reflect what&#x27;s in my \\\\nrecall. A large number of individuals suffer from mental health \\\\nissues, alcohol, and drug addictions.\\\\n    Many of those are drivers to incarceration. So, it&#x27;s really \\\\nour job to focus on getting them healthy, both physically and \\\\nmentally, before they come back and become our good neighbors. \\\\nSo, all our institutions have doctoral level psychiatrists--or \\\\npsychologists, excuse me. We have 500 psychologists and \\\\napproximately 600 treatment specialists across the country who \\\\nfocus on this alone as well as residential and nonresidential \\\\nalcohol and drug treatment.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. I appreciate that. You talked especially in your \\\\ntestimony about recruitment and retention. By way of staffing, \\\\nhow many staffers are you down? Then I&#x27;m wondering has there \\\\nbeen any attempt in terms of compensation, attempted special \\\\npay increases for staff, for example, that we should know about \\\\nbecause of our appropriations role and responsible? So \\\\nstaffing, how much are you down and what do you need in terms \\\\nof appropriations and any special pay?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Great. So, I&#x27;ll start with the money. As I said \\\\nin my opening comments, we paid over 128 million dollars last \\\\nyear in recruitment and retention incentives alone. We&#x27;re \\\\nworking with the department and OPM specifically on a special \\\\nsalary rate.\\\\n    Because as I&#x27;ve said before, these incentives are band-aids \\\\nonly. The bottom line is our employees are not getting paid \\\\nenough. So, a special salary rate is really the long-term fix.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. What does that look like? What would a special \\\\nsalary rate look like?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We estimate needing an additional 600 million \\\\ndollars a year to have that salary rate accepted and have a \\\\ncompetitive salary with other law enforcement agencies and the \\\\nprivate sector.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. OK. Is that what is meant by a special pay \\\\nincrease? Is that what you&#x27;re--\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Special salary rate, that&#x27;s correct.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. OK. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We&#x27;re asking for all the employees in our \\\\ninstitutions.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. In terms of staffing, under the previous \\\\nadministration, how many staff members did you lose?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That 2016 number keeps coming up. It was around \\\\n6,000, I believe. What we&#x27;ve really focused on is the fact that \\\\neven though we have positional authority right now, we&#x27;re not \\\\nable to fill them all.\\\\n    So, you asked about what is authorized and what is filled. \\\\nWe have over 20,000 authorized in the correctional officer \\\\nseries. If you look at boots on the ground, those correctional \\\\nofficers that you think of managing the units, we have about \\\\n14,900 authorized, and only 83 percent of those are filled.\\\\n    We also had a contractor come in and do an assessment to \\\\nfigure out going forward how many do we need to safely operate \\\\nour institutions. They&#x27;re telling us we need an additional \\\\n4,000 correctional officers and another 2,500 healthcare \\\\nprofessionals. They&#x27;re going to complete their analysis this \\\\nfall on the other employees that are working inside our \\\\ninstitutions.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. Thank you for your leadership, and I hope those \\\\nwho appropriate the money for the Bureau, for your tireless \\\\nstaff--actually hear those words and meet the moment.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you, Congressman.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentlelady&#x27;s time has expired. Chair now \\\\nrecognizes the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Fry.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would yield my five \\\\nminutes to the distinguished Member and future Governor of the \\\\nState of North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Thank you. Where are you from in South \\\\nDakota?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Milbank.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Oh, fantastic.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So not far from your border.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Ninety percent of the people who are in \\\\ncustody and in the Federal system will be released?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That&#x27;s correct.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re here. That is why it&#x27;s \\\\nimportant. You inherited a mess. You inherited a mess. We \\\\nwalked through--and there&#x27;s not a lot of great stories over the \\\\nlast five years.\\\\n    I think there are some, and I think it can also help. The \\\\nCARES Act recidivism rate was 3.7 percent. That&#x27;s roughly 10 \\\\npercent of BOP at large, and it&#x27;s statistically no different \\\\nthan traditional home confinement. Are my numbers accurate?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. The recidivism rate for CARES Act was about 4.4 \\\\npercent is what I have, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. The recidivism rate for First Step Act is \\\\nabout 35-37 percent lower than the BOP at large?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That&#x27;s correct.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. So, these programs work. So, when we&#x27;re \\\\ntalking about staffing and I&#x27;m going to ask about the OPM \\\\nsalary thing in a second because there&#x27;s another side to this, \\\\nright? What percentage of people who you hire are gone within \\\\nthe first year? Do you know?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I don&#x27;t have that number, but it is an area of \\\\nconcern because we were able to onboard in 2022. We onboarded \\\\nfewer than last. So, the good news for his year so far is that \\\\nwe&#x27;ve onboarded 1,400 and it&#x27;s more than have left.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. I appreciate you saying you support the BOP \\\\noversight bill because it&#x27;s not often we have somebody in \\\\nhere--there&#x27;s some strict measures in there. You talked about \\\\naugmentation and all those different issues. If you&#x27;re hitting \\\\novertime at 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, and you&#x27;re committee is to \\\\nworking another two hours a week, and you have two kids at home \\\\nthat you haven&#x27;t seen and you&#x27;re working in a dilapidated \\\\nfacility.\\\\n    People have to be locked up all weekend because you don&#x27;t \\\\nhave enough staff to get them in there. Do you know what that \\\\ncreates? One, it&#x27;s a terrible working environment outside of \\\\nthe pay.\\\\n    It also creates recidivism. There are things the Federal \\\\nsystem does really well. One of them is pretrial release. It&#x27;s \\\\nfascinating to me because it&#x27;s almost counterintuitive.\\\\n    It&#x27;s less confrontational, more rehabilitative, life choice \\\\nskills, all those different things. The problem is nothing you \\\\nget taught in pretrial release you remember 10 years later when \\\\nyou get a 10-year minimum mandatory. Some of it is \\\\ngeographical.\\\\n    One of the things the Federal prison system I don&#x27;t think \\\\ndoes very well and I think we have an opportunity to increase \\\\non it is reentry. The tools for reentry, we have a bill with \\\\nDavid Trone, just to give everybody a BOP ID to set up a bank \\\\naccount, or to buy a bus ticket, or to get home. So, when we&#x27;re \\\\ntalking about the First Step implementation, we talk about what \\\\nhappens when they get out.\\\\n    What are you guys doing to implement--and this becomes more \\\\nimportant because a lot of times people are not incarcerated \\\\nlocally. So, what are you doing, so meeting the good time \\\\ncredits and outside of staffing because I&#x27;m assuming staffing \\\\nis a challenge to this. What are you doing to increase the \\\\nability of the people who qualify for video calls with family, \\\\ntelephone calls with family, all those different issues, \\\\nbecause we know and the data supports the more you do that, the \\\\nless likely they&#x27;re going to reoffend when they get out.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, you covered so much there.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. I&#x27;m taking everybody&#x27;s time.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Of course. As the Director of BOP and as the \\\\nformer Inspector General of the good State of Oregon, of course \\\\nI support the Oversight Act. I understand the important role of \\\\nthe Inspector General. He and I work closely.\\\\n    As it relates to release IDs, I had met with Congressman \\\\nTrone many times. I&#x27;m proud to report to the Committee that all \\\\nthe BOP facilities now have the ability to issue an ID. So, \\\\nindividuals are actually leaving--in fact, since December 2023, \\\\nwe&#x27;ve generated over 6,500 release cards. As you all know, \\\\nthat&#x27;s an incredible barrier to reentry.\\\\n    As it relates to staffing inside our institutions, when I \\\\nwalk the halls of our institutions and we have great \\\\nrepresentatives from the union here in the room, they&#x27;re \\\\nexhausted. They tell me exactly the anecdotal stories that you \\\\njust shared, that the families have pick up times figured out \\\\nand who&#x27;s cooking figured out. The Federal Bureau of Prisons \\\\nmesses it up regularly because of mandated overtime.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. We want to hold people accountable.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. We want them to serve their sentence.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Ideally we&#x27;d prefer when they get out, they \\\\ndon&#x27;t reoffend again right away.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. That&#x27;s right.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. That is the officer safety. This is for \\\\neverybody. This is the only adult population that the Federal \\\\nGovernment is in charge of everything.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. We have taken care, custody, and control of \\\\nthem. Whether it&#x27;s a facility and everybody looks at it and \\\\nsays, I don&#x27;t care what kind of room a violent criminal is in. \\\\nThe employees do.\\\\n    If you&#x27;re working in something that&#x27;s 30 years old and \\\\nacross all of that, and if we don&#x27;t retain employees because \\\\nit&#x27;s not just the number of employees. It&#x27;s how many years of \\\\nexperience they have. That is the single best way to deliver \\\\nall of the things we need to deliver and also ensure a safe and \\\\nsecure society. With that, I yield back. I&#x27;m sorry.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman yields back. The Chair recognizes \\\\nthe gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cohen.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir. Director Peters, thank you for \\\\ncoming. Before I talk to you, I&#x27;d like to reflect a few of my \\\\nthoughts about Chair Jackson Lee.\\\\n    We sat together for nearly the entire 18 years I&#x27;ve been \\\\nhere side by side in the Judiciary Committee. She came to \\\\nMemphis for a hearing. We had a field hearing and supported me. \\\\nI went to Houston and supported her.\\\\n    She was a dynamic figure and one of a kind. She was a \\\\nforce, and a force that soaked up as much information as she \\\\ncould to help her people and justice as she saw it and did a \\\\nmarvelous job in Congress. She will certainly be missed. She \\\\nwas something else.\\\\n    Director Peters, let me ask you this. I&#x27;ve not caught a lot \\\\nof the hearing. So, I&#x27;m asking you something that&#x27;s been asked \\\\nbefore, just let me know that.\\\\n    Following up on the Governor&#x27;s questions, what does a \\\\nperson get when they&#x27;re released from prison right now? You&#x27;re \\\\ntalking about this card. What&#x27;s such a big deal about giving \\\\nsomebody a card?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. It&#x27;s such a big deal because it&#x27;s a barrier to \\\\nso many things, to getting a bank account when you get out, to \\\\nbeing able to show formal ID to rent an apartment.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. I can see that they need it. Why is it such a \\\\nproblem to give it to them?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, it&#x27;s been a barrier on so many levels \\\\nbecause the way that the individuals get IDs when they get into \\\\nthe community is through the Department of Motor Vehicles. If \\\\nyou&#x27;ve been incarcerated for a while, you might not have that \\\\nSocial Security card. You might not have that birth \\\\ncertificate. So the Federal Bureau of Prisons&#x27; employees spends \\\\ntime sleuthing and getting those document, so that they do have \\\\nthem when they leave. Then, they also have an official ID that \\\\nis being accepted in 26 States as these individuals come back \\\\ninto our communities.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Then when they leave the prison system, are they \\\\njust taken out the prison doors and released? Or are they given \\\\ntransportation back home? How is that handled?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, the majority of them not only receive \\\\ntransportation, but they receive transportation to a \\\\nresidential reentry center or to home confinement. So, I think \\\\nthe ability to take people who are still serving a sentence and \\\\nhave a step down for them in the community really proves \\\\nbeneficial so that they have a safe environment to try to \\\\nreenter, but with wraparound services around them.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Once they leave the Bureau of Prison and they go \\\\nto these programs which are available to them, Bureau of \\\\nPrisons is totally out. You all don&#x27;t have any--you don&#x27;t give \\\\nthem any money to have an opportunity to buy some things when \\\\nthey get out or any credits?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. We encourage people to save money on their \\\\naccount for reentry purposes. When they&#x27;re in the residential \\\\nreentry center or on home confinement, they&#x27;re still sentenced \\\\nto the Bureau. So, they&#x27;re still under our custody which is why \\\\nit&#x27;s a great step down. It isn&#x27;t until their sentence expires \\\\nthat then we hand them off to pretrial for supervision--or \\\\nprobation--\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. On Saturday, I went to Payne&#x27;s Bar-B-Que in \\\\nMemphis and a man came up to me. After shaking my hand for the \\\\nlongest period of time I&#x27;ve ever had my hand shaken, a big man. \\\\nAnyway, he came up to me afterwards at lunch and he said, I \\\\njust spent 15 years in the Federal system, and I want to start \\\\na reentry program. How does somebody start a reentry program \\\\nfrom Federal prisoners?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, they would be able to reach out to our \\\\nprocurement staff and be able to share what their reentry idea \\\\nis. Our procurement staff would be able to point them in the \\\\nright direction.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. So, they go to the Federal Correctional Facility \\\\nin Memphis?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. No, I would refer them to our procurement staff \\\\nat headquarters.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. OK, OK. They need something. Representative \\\\nArmstrong was getting close to an idea they just can&#x27;t leave \\\\nthem there. They need help so they don&#x27;t commit crimes when \\\\nthey&#x27;re released. Has there been any privatization of any \\\\nFederal services, prisons?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, we had engaged in 11 contracts with private \\\\nprisons. Based on the President&#x27;s Executive Order, we no longer \\\\nengage in any of those contracts.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. I&#x27;m not for private prisons. I think it&#x27;s the \\\\ngovernment&#x27;s responsibility. A lot of States have done it. \\\\nWhat&#x27;s been experience with private prisons?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, I&#x27;m previously the Director of the Oregon \\\\nDepartment of Corrections. That was actually statutorily \\\\nprohibited in Oregon. So, it wasn&#x27;t something I was familiar \\\\nwith there. Then, of course, the Executive Order was in place \\\\nwhen I arrived in this role. We successfully complied with the \\\\nExecutive Order&#x27;s timeframe and ended those contracts.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Thank you. Compassionate release, that&#x27;s a \\\\nprogram I&#x27;ve been interested in as well. What have you done to \\\\nstreamline the compassionate release program and get more \\\\npeople that are old as hell who are not going to be able to or \\\\nwant to commit a crime again out of the system and home?\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired, but you may \\\\nanswer the question.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you. Then in the interest of time, I&#x27;ll \\\\nsay I think the most prominent expansion that we&#x27;ve engaged in \\\\nthis last year has been to be able to include confirmed victims \\\\nof sexual assault inside our institutions for compassionate \\\\nrelease. That was part of the U.S. sentencing guideline \\\\nchanges.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Did you say victims of sexual assault? OK.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Confirmed victims of sexual assault on our \\\\nwatch that they&#x27;re now able to apply for--and then I think it&#x27;s \\\\nimportant for the Committee to understand I can recommend to \\\\nthe courts for compassionate release. That decision ultimately \\\\nrests with the courts. I think that&#x27;s a really important \\\\nexpansion of compassionate release that we&#x27;ve engaged in this \\\\nlast year.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. If I may--\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Gentleman&#x27;s time is expired. The Chair \\\\nrecognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Director Peters, thank \\\\nyou for your work as Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. \\\\nThe people you house in your facilities are there for a limited \\\\nperiod before they reenter society.\\\\n    As someone who believes that everyone deserves a second \\\\nchance, that is what I am most interested in. So, I want to \\\\njump right in and ask you about how well the prison system is \\\\nworking when it comes to rehabilitation and reentry. I believe \\\\nit&#x27;s imperative that we equip inmates with the tools they need \\\\nto succeed on the outside.\\\\n    Doing that will help them be engaged productive members of \\\\nsociety. It is what will keep them from entering recidivism. \\\\nCan you please talk about the programs that you have inside the \\\\nprison walls that help with rehabilitation? Do you have enough \\\\nstaffing and resources to run these programs effectively?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, we have over 115 evidence-based recidivism \\\\nreduction programs now. As I walk the halls of our \\\\ninstitutions, there&#x27;s a lot of creativity about even expanding \\\\nthose. So, everything from mental health treatment to alcohol \\\\nand drug treatment, to anger management, to cognitive \\\\nbehavioral therapy, residential alcohol and drug programs, \\\\nnonresidential, so a plethora of programs.\\\\n    We believe at the Bureau that the conversation around \\\\nreentry begins on day one to get them prepared to become those \\\\ngood neighbors as you say. Do we have enough staff? No. Are \\\\nthey being paid enough? No.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. I was proud that that the bipartisan First \\\\nStep Act was signed into law back in 2018, which contained both \\\\nsentencing and prison reforms aimed at recidivism reduction. \\\\nIt&#x27;s the most significant bipartisan criminal justice reform \\\\nlegislation in a generation. The First Step Act provides that \\\\nthose serving sentences have the opportunity to earn good time \\\\ncredits for participating in recidivism reduction programs and \\\\nrelated activities.\\\\n    For qualifying low-level offenders, those time credits will \\\\nresult in early release. Also, there are other changes to the \\\\ngood time credit calculation. There are some other things in \\\\nthe First Step Act about having to do with when the sentence \\\\nwas first commenced. Can you talk about how you calculate those \\\\nearned time credits for persons who are in prison at the time \\\\nthe First Step Act passed?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Yes, so originally when the First Step Act \\\\npassed, it was a manual calculation which caused a lot of labor \\\\nand a lot of confusion among the population. So, we have now \\\\nautomated the earned time credits. Just recently in the \\\\nprevious months, not only have we automated the earned time \\\\ncredits, we&#x27;re actually projecting out what their release date \\\\nmight be as we talked about earlier as a carrot so that people \\\\nunderstand if they continue to engage in programming and \\\\ntreatment, if they continue to have good conduct inside the \\\\ninstitution, then they know what their earliest release could \\\\nbe.\\\\n    You mentioned how many people are released and the \\\\nrecidivism rate. Under the First Step Act, we&#x27;ve already \\\\nreleased over 35,000 individuals with a recidivism rate of just \\\\n9.7 percent. So, you&#x27;re correct. It is working.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Thank you. What actions has BOP taken to \\\\nensure that risk and needs assessments are conducted as \\\\nrequired and that there are sufficient evidence-based \\\\nrecidivism reduction programs available to meet the needs of \\\\nall incarcerated people?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Yes, so we have over 150 evidence-based \\\\nrecidivism reduction programs and productive activities right \\\\nnow. We are working to expand those every day. As I walk the \\\\nhalls of our institutions, the creativity that I&#x27;m seeing \\\\naround advancing additional programs is great.\\\\n    I mentioned earlier that I just visited our prison in \\\\nMilan, Michigan, which happens to have the only Federal prison \\\\nwith a high school inside of it. So, you can get not just a GED \\\\nbut a high school diploma. They had over 15 apprenticeship \\\\nprograms at that one facility. So, people are taking--we say \\\\nthe First Step Act is part of who we are, part of our daily \\\\nlife now. You see that when you walk the halls of our \\\\ninstitutions.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Thank you. With that, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman yields back. Chair recognizes the \\\\ngentlelady from Florida, Ms. Lee, for five minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for having this hearing. \\\\nDirector Peters, thank you for being here with us today and for \\\\nyour testimony about your work with the Bureau of Prisons. The \\\\nlast time you were here with us, one of the things that we \\\\ndiscussed were the conditions at FCI Dublin and the incidents \\\\nof the abuse of female prisoners.\\\\n    You shared with us your plans to ensure that oversight and \\\\naccountability were brought to that facility. Of course, since \\\\nthat time, the facility has been closed. Would you share with \\\\nus more about your efforts in that regard and where the women \\\\nwho were housed at FCI Dublin are now?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you, Congresswoman. So, as we spoke \\\\npreviously, we poured so many resources into that institution \\\\nin hopes that it would succeed, additional staffing, additional \\\\nincentives, additional psychologists, trauma informed training, \\\\nand gender responsive training. We changed the executive team \\\\nthree times over and unfortunately concluded that it still was \\\\nnot meeting expectations.\\\\n    So, we temporarily closed it. We did move individuals to \\\\nother female facilities. For those individuals that had less \\\\nthan five months on their sentence, we moved them to SeaTac, \\\\nour facility in Washington to ensure that they were close as \\\\nthey could be to family. Others have been distributed \\\\nthroughout the country at other female facilities.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. You also mentioned earlier some of the changes \\\\nthat you&#x27;ve made internally to increase accountability and \\\\nprosecutions for those who do commit these types of violent \\\\nacts against people who are in custody. Specifically, you \\\\ntouched on a very large increase in the number of people \\\\nassigned to internal affairs and changing the reporting process \\\\nto not go through a warden but instead go straight to \\\\nheadquarters. Would you give us a summary of your assessment?\\\\n    Are those changes working? Were the people who committed \\\\nthese crimes at FCI Dublin held to account? Would you share \\\\nwith us your perspective on what has been done to ensure this \\\\ntype of treatment of female inmates doesn&#x27;t reoccur?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I think it starts exactly where you&#x27;re at, \\\\nemployee accountability. For the record, I&#x27;d like to say the \\\\nsuper majority of our employees come to work every day doing \\\\nthe right thing, are ethical, and are as disappointed as you \\\\nand I are when people engage in this type of egregious \\\\nmisconduct. So, the realignment that you talk about, the \\\\nadditional staff that we brought on is working.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve closed--since August 2022 when I started, we&#x27;ve \\\\nclosed over 9,500 open matters in the Office of Internal \\\\nAffairs. We have seen more prosecutions. There are still \\\\ninvestigations pending out of Dublin. We may see more.\\\\n    I&#x27;ve worked very closely with the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s as has \\\\nthe Deputy Attorney General to ensure that they&#x27;re prosecuting \\\\nthese cases. The importance of holding people accountable is so \\\\nimportant. Then we&#x27;ve done so many other things.\\\\n    We work closely with the Inspector General who is engaged \\\\nin unannounced visits. The Office of the Deputy Attorney \\\\nGeneral has created SAFER teams that have now visited every \\\\nsingle one of our female facilities. We&#x27;ve done cultural \\\\nassessments now at all our female facilities to see if we can \\\\nsee warning signs, so we don&#x27;t ever get to a place again where \\\\nwe have a culture that is as egregious as the one at Dublin. As \\\\nI mentioned earlier, I am pleased with the passage of the \\\\nOversight Act which will shepherd forward more announced and \\\\nunannounced visits from the Inspector General, because I \\\\nactually believe we can&#x27;t do this work alone.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. I was interested in exactly that point. What about \\\\nthe Federal Prison Oversight Act do you believe that there are \\\\nprovisions in there that are going to be specifically \\\\nimpactful? Of course, I am very pleased to see it pass the \\\\nHouse, pass the Senate. Are there provisions there that you \\\\nthink will help prevent further abuse of women who are in \\\\ncustody?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I do because the act really enhances what&#x27;s \\\\nalready happening with the Office of the Inspector General. It \\\\njust allows for more of the unannounced visits, using data to \\\\nlook at any concerns that we have so that we can see a culture \\\\nchange before it gets into a more difficult place. So, we&#x27;ll be \\\\nseeing more announced visits, more unannounced visits from the \\\\nInspector General. Then I think the ombudsman position is very \\\\npowerful as well for it to have a place where individuals can \\\\nbring forward complaints and somebody there to ensure that \\\\nthose complaints are asked and answered.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. What about women in custody who are feeling \\\\nthreatened or are in danger? What options do they have to \\\\nensure that their concerns are heard and that they are kept \\\\nsafe?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, it&#x27;s our obligation to create a culture \\\\nwhere they feel safe coming forward. That&#x27;s one of the things \\\\nthat we really work on with our trauma informed care and our \\\\ngender responsivity. They have the right to come forward to any \\\\nemployee that they feel safe talking to. They also have the \\\\nability to contact the Inspector General through anonymous \\\\nchannels to be able to report any complaints or concerns that \\\\nthey have.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. The Chair recognizes himself for five \\\\nminutes of questions. Director, I&#x27;ve received certain reports \\\\nthat more than 60,000 First Step Act eligible inmates in the \\\\nsystem face significant delays in their prerelease to a halfway \\\\nhouse or final release to freedom because there&#x27;s not full \\\\ncompliance or you haven&#x27;t been able to fully comply with the \\\\nFirst Step Act yet.\\\\n    There are estimates that these delays range from 3-6 to \\\\neven as much as 12 months depending on the length of sentence \\\\nwhich may be costing the taxpayers as much as five billion \\\\ndollars according to estimates. So, I&#x27;m going to ask you today \\\\nis that do those numbers sound accurate to you? Are they \\\\naccurate?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. I&#x27;d want to confirm with my team on the \\\\naccuracy of the numbers. Anecdotally, that is what I&#x27;m hearing \\\\nwhen I walk the institutions. There&#x27;s a lot of frustration with \\\\nthe adult in custody population about them already qualifying \\\\nfor an RRC.\\\\n    We simply don&#x27;t have the capacity in the community. So, \\\\nyou&#x27;re raising a very important point. The residential reentry \\\\ncenter program was created before FSA. Before FSA, people would \\\\nspend weeks or months in an RRC.\\\\n    Now, they qualify for months and years in a Residential \\\\nReentry Center. So, we are at capacity. Right now, my team is \\\\nassessing what that future need will be in terms of resources \\\\nfor Residential Reentry Centers.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. So, there&#x27;s been a long promise but much delayed \\\\nconditional maximum FTC calculator. What&#x27;s the delay on that? \\\\nIs that happening? When can we anticipate that?\\\\n    Is there a way for you to commit? I&#x27;d like you to commit to \\\\nget that up and running within the next 60 days. Tell me what&#x27;s \\\\ngoing on with that, please.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, Congressman, that was the case. It&#x27;s now \\\\nthe earned time credit calculator.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Right. Projected earned time credit calculator.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. It&#x27;s fully operational. Any errors that we&#x27;re \\\\nhearing about now are because of human input into the system, \\\\nnot because the earned time credit calculator is broken. Then, \\\\njust recently in the last few months, we have expanded the \\\\nearned time credit calculator to do a full on projection so \\\\nthat people can see if they behave in prison, if they stay in \\\\nprogramming and treatment, their earliest release date is X.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. So, thank you for that, and I&#x27;m going to leave \\\\nthat topic for a second. We can maybe talk more about that \\\\nlater offline. We&#x27;ve requested a number of items of information \\\\nand requested some recorded transcribed interviews with the \\\\nguard in Pensacola and the two wardens in Pensacola related to \\\\nthe Galanis case.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve not been able to have those interviews yet. Before we \\\\nfinish today, I want to ask you for that commitment. There&#x27;s \\\\nalso a series of other items, and I&#x27;m going to run through \\\\nthose real quickly.\\\\n    We requested and subpoenaed information on the following. \\\\nWe received less than fulsome responses to some of them. The \\\\npolicies, procedures, and communications regarding Galanis&#x27; \\\\napplication for CARES Act home confinement, we received a \\\\nlittle bit on that.\\\\n    We expect more, all coordination between staff members of \\\\nBOP and the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Southern District of \\\\nNew York, and DOJ in that case, again, the information \\\\nregarding the allegations of sexual assault and sexual \\\\nharassment perpetrated against Galanis by a BOP staff member. \\\\nThen I want to ask you--and then there&#x27;s several other things. \\\\nI&#x27;ll get to those in a second if I&#x27;ve got time. I want to ask \\\\nyou, are you aware the requirements of the Prison Rape \\\\nElimination Act? I&#x27;m sure you are.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. What is the standard operating procedure of the \\\\nBureau for women inmate reports being sexually assaulted by BOP \\\\npersonnel?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. So, we take all allegations of sexual assault \\\\nvery seriously. They&#x27;re referred to the Office of Internal \\\\nAffairs. If there&#x27;s any suspicion of criminal misconduct, it&#x27;s \\\\nreferred to the Office of the Inspector General.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. So, is the only procedure at that point is a \\\\nreferral to IA?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. OIA.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. OIA.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Then OIG.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. There&#x27;s no immediate movement of that personnel \\\\nfrom one area to another?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Oh, yes. There absolutely could be, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. I want that as well, please.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Yes, so we do an assessment around safety, both \\\\nfor the victim--safety for the victim and safety for other \\\\nindividuals in the institutions.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. So, how quickly is it for an inmate to be \\\\nremoved from the facility?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. It&#x27;s common practice for the victim to be moved \\\\nin short order or the employee moved in short order.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. So, when you say short order, what are we \\\\ntalking about?\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Sometimes it could be immediate, Congressman.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. OK. Let&#x27;s see here. I want to see here. There \\\\nwas a judge in Kansas. My time is expired. I&#x27;m going to send \\\\nyou some written questions as well, OK, that we&#x27;re going to \\\\nwant answers to because I want to respect everyone&#x27;s time here.\\\\n    So, I&#x27;ll send you some written questions. I would, again, \\\\nget back to the less than fulsome answers we received on the \\\\nrequest for documents and answers that we&#x27;ve sent. Director, I \\\\nwould ask that you get your team on that right away, so we get \\\\nthat information in and appreciate you being here today. With \\\\nthat, this Committee is adjourned.\\\\n    Ms. Peters. Thank you, Congressman. Thank you, members.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 12:37 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]\\\\n\\\\n    All materials submitted for the record by Members of the \\\\nSub-\\\\ncommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance can\\\\nbe found at: https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent. \\\\naspx?EventID=117533.\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/117545/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"07/24/2024\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"\\\\u201cOversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\\\\u201d\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73196, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"Judiciary\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                        OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF \\\\n                                INVESTIGATION\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n                                 HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                       COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\\\\n\\\\n                     U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             SECOND SESSION\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                        WEDNESDAY, JULY 24, 2024\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                           Serial No. 118-93\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n         Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\\\\n         \\\\n[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]         \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n               Available via: http://judiciary.house.gov\\\\n               \\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                   U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE                    \\\\n56-425                      WASHINGTON : 2024                    \\\\n          \\\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------                \\\\n              \\\\n                       COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\\\\n\\\\n                        JIM JORDAN, Ohio, Chair\\\\n\\\\nDARRELL ISSA, California             JERROLD NADLER, New York, Ranking \\\\nMATT GAETZ, Florida                      Member\\\\nANDY BIGGS, Arizona                  ZOE LOFGREN, California\\\\nTOM McCLINTOCK, California           STEVE COHEN, Tennessee\\\\nTOM TIFFANY, Wisconsin               HENRY C. ``HANK&#x27;&#x27; JOHNSON, Jr., \\\\nTHOMAS MASSIE, Kentucky                  Georgia\\\\nCHIP ROY, Texas                      ADAM SCHIFF, California\\\\nDAN BISHOP, North Carolina           ERIC SWALWELL, California\\\\nVICTORIA SPARTZ, Indiana             TED LIEU, California\\\\nSCOTT FITZGERALD, Wisconsin          PRAMILA JAYAPAL, Washington\\\\nCLIFF BENTZ, Oregon                  J.

I want to begin today&#x27;s hearing by \\\\nrecognizing the fact that we no longer have one of the great \\\\nMembers with us, Sheila Jackson Lee, as we all know passed \\\\naway. She was a dedicated public servant. Her service on this \\\\nCommittee spanned nearly three decades and included shepherding \\\\nthrough countless pieces of legislation. I said yesterday at \\\\nSubcommittee hearing that I don&#x27;t know that there was any \\\\nMember of Congress who got more out of five minutes than Sheila \\\\ndid. She was just a pleasant spirit who we all enjoyed and we \\\\nare thinking about her family. We all certainly will miss \\\\nSheila.\\\\n    I yield to the Ranking Member for comments.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, this room in \\\\nour hearts feels a little emptier today to mourn the loss of \\\\nour dear friend colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee. In the nearly 30 \\\\nyears that I served with Sheila on the Judiciary Committee, I \\\\nwitnessed her boundless energy, her courage, and her character \\\\nas she lent her voice in her legislative talents to nearly \\\\nevery issue that came before this Committee. Whether it was \\\\nadvocating for just and humane immigration reform, working to \\\\nprotect voting rights and preserve our civil liberties, or \\\\ndelving into the technical details of administrative law and \\\\nproperty, intellectual property, Sheila was always at the \\\\nforefront of our work.\\\\n    Sheila made perhaps her greatest mark serving as the Chair \\\\nand later Ranking Member of the Crime Subcommittee. In this \\\\nrole, she worked in a bipartisan fashion to re-authorize the \\\\nViolence Against Women Act and to protect victims of \\\\ntrafficking among many other successes.\\\\n    She was also a leader of such issues as sentencing reform, \\\\ngun safety, police accountability, and racial justice. Sheila \\\\nengaged in many spirited debates, but she always had the \\\\ndeepest respect for all her colleagues, even though to whom she \\\\nvehemently disagreed. She deeply loved the institution of \\\\nCongress and particularly the Judiciary Committee because it \\\\ngave her platform to make a meaningful impact on the lives of \\\\nmillions of Americans.\\\\n    If Sheila took up a cause, she could be relentless in her \\\\ndetermination to see it through whether that meant making one \\\\nextra phone call, going to one more meeting, or frame one more \\\\namendment, or making one more speech. She would not rest until \\\\nshe thought she had done everything she could to fight for the \\\\nissues she cared about. Through it all, she stayed true to her \\\\nvalues and always had the people of Houston close to her heart.\\\\n    We are all better for having known her. The American people \\\\nare better for having had her in their corner all these years. \\\\nI will deeply miss my friend and colleague. May her memory be a \\\\nblessing. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. I want to thank the Ranking Member. Well \\\\nsaid. Now, the Chair will recognize himself for an opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    On July 13th it was a terrible day for America. We all \\\\nagree spirited debate, fighting for what you believe in, is \\\\npart of what makes this country the greatest nation in the \\\\nworld. The First Amendment and robust political debate are not \\\\nconsistent in any way with violence. What happened in Butler, \\\\nPennsylvania, was a tragedy. It took the life of a good man, \\\\nCorey Comperatore, leaving a wife without a husband, and two \\\\ndaughters without a father. Others were injured and of course, \\\\nformer President Trump, by the grace of God, survived the \\\\nassassination attempt.\\\\n    There are a lot of unanswered questions about the security \\\\nfailures that day, questions about decisions made before the \\\\nrally, questions about actions during the rally, and questions \\\\nabout statements made after the event concluded.\\\\n    Prior to the rally, why was the President&#x27;s security detail \\\\ndenied requests for extra resources? Why weren&#x27;t all the \\\\nbuildings secured? There were a finite number of buildings that \\\\nneeded to be secured. Why wasn&#x27;t that done? Why was the \\\\nPresident allowed to walk out on the stage when there was a \\\\nsuspicious person on the property?\\\\n    During the rally, what exactly happened between 6:09 and \\\\n6:14 p.m., those critical five minutes? We know from briefings \\\\nfrom the Director and the Deputy Director of the FBI and other \\\\ninformation we have gathered, that at 6:09, the shooter was \\\\nidentified on the roof. At 6:10, the counter sniper was \\\\nnotified. Counter sniper teams were notified about the shooter. \\\\nAt 6:11, the shooter fired several shots injuring and killing \\\\none person, injuring others. At 6:12, the counter sniper took \\\\ndown the shooter, and at 6:14, President Trump was escorted off \\\\nthe stage by Secret Service agents. We need to know what \\\\nhappened play by play, moment by moment, second by second, the \\\\ncommunications that took place, again, during that critical \\\\nfive minutes.\\\\n    Then, finally, after the rally, why did both the Secret \\\\nService and Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas lie to the \\\\nAmerican people? July 14th, the day after the attack, Secret \\\\nService spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said this,\\\\n\\\\n        The assertion that a member of the former President&#x27;s security \\\\n        team requested additional security resources that the U.S. \\\\n        Secret Service or the Department of Homeland Security rebuffed \\\\n        is absolutely false.\\\\n\\\\nThe next day, Secretary Mayorkas said,\\\\n\\\\n        That is an unequivocally false assertion. We had not received \\\\n        any requests for additional security measures that were \\\\n        rebuffed.\\\\n\\\\n    Five days later, top officials repeatedly rejected requests \\\\nfrom Donald Trump&#x27;s security detail for more personnel, and on \\\\nthe 21st of July, The New York Times confirming what The \\\\nWashington Post reported said,\\\\n\\\\n        Mr. Guglielmi acknowledged that the Secret Service had turned \\\\n        down requests for additional Federal security assets for Mr. \\\\n        Trump&#x27;s detail.\\\\n\\\\nA 180+ change. Why did they initially lie to us in the days \\\\nafter the attack in Pennsylvania?\\\\n    Finally, we hope to learn more today from Director Wray \\\\nabout the shooter, his use of the drone, the explosives that \\\\nwere in his car, how he got on the roof, and a host of other \\\\nquestions. It is our hope that Director Wray&#x27;s testimony can \\\\nbegin to get answers to the American people about all those \\\\nquestions and concerns.\\\\n    So, Director, we appreciate you being here, and we trust \\\\nthat you are going to be as transparent with the Committee and \\\\nthe country as you possibly can. I am sure you understand that \\\\na significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism \\\\nregarding the FBI&#x27;s ability to conduct a fair, honest, open, \\\\nand transparent investigation. That skepticism is based on what \\\\nthey have witnessed over the past several years. The American \\\\npeople have seen a Biden-Harris Justice Department. They can&#x27;t \\\\ntell us who planted the pipe bombs on January 6th. They can&#x27;t \\\\ntell us who leaked the Dobbs opinion. They can&#x27;t tell us who \\\\nput cocaine at the White House.\\\\n    The Biden-Harris Justice Department who raided President \\\\nTrump&#x27;s home, the Biden-Harris Justice Department who worked \\\\nwith social media companies to censor Americans, the Biden-\\\\nHarris Justice Department who let the country believe that the \\\\nHunter Biden laptop was misinformation when they knew at the \\\\ntime it was authentic. Maybe most importantly, a Biden-Harris \\\\nJustice Department who retaliated against whistleblowers who \\\\ncame to this Committee and spoke to us about these issues.\\\\n    Last week, we sent you 12 questions about what occurred on \\\\nJuly 13th. We expect you to answer those questions and the \\\\nothers that I have just outlined. Again, we thank you for being \\\\nhere today and appreciate your willingness to answer the \\\\nquestions that the Committee is going to have. With that, I \\\\nwould yield to the Ranking Member for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, two weeks ago \\\\nour country witnessed the shocking assassination attempt on a \\\\nPresidential candidate. Now, I disagree with Donald Trump on \\\\nalmost every policy area imaginable. I am frequently shocked \\\\nand outraged at the plans he has for our country and the words \\\\nthat come out of his mouth. I have dedicated much of the last \\\\neight years to fighting his agenda. Regardless of my strong \\\\nfeelings about Donald Trump&#x27;s behavior, I unequivocally and \\\\nunabashedly condemn with every fiber of my being the attempt \\\\nagainst his life. This is not just an attack on a man, but an \\\\nattack on our democracy.\\\\n    Political violence erodes the very foundations of our \\\\nNation. The concepts of freedom of speech, of peaceful \\\\ntransitions of power, of a democratic government at its core, \\\\nthese cannot exist if political violence is allowed to fester \\\\nand to go unchecked. If you think that this one assassin&#x27;s \\\\nbullet was a bolt out of the blue, and not quite of a wave of \\\\nviolence that has threatened this Nation for years, then you \\\\nhave missed the point of what my Democratic colleagues and I \\\\nhave been imploring you to hear for some time.\\\\n    Election workers, many of them working for free, face near \\\\nconstant threats of violence. In one recent instance in \\\\nIndiana, a man pleaded guilty to threatening to kill an \\\\nelection worker who said that there were no irregularities in \\\\nthe recent election. That man said, ``Ten million plus patriots \\\\nwill surround you when you least expect it and will, expletive, \\\\nkill you.&#x27;&#x27; That is political violence.\\\\n    In another instance, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s husband \\\\nwas bludgeoned over the head with a hammer by an intruder in \\\\nhis home who had been there to capture Ms. Pelosi, interrogate \\\\nher, and possibly ``break her kneecaps&#x27;&#x27; because of her liberal \\\\nviews. That is political violence.\\\\n    The death threats surging against Vice President Harris, \\\\nformer President Obama, his wife, Michelle, and Governor \\\\nDeSantis, as well as many others, including videos online of \\\\nindividuals holding guns making assassination threats, that is \\\\npolitical violence. The plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen \\\\nWhitmer and overthrow parts of the State Government, that is \\\\npolitical violence. The brutal deadly attack three years \\\\nagainst this very building with rioters breaking through police \\\\nbarriers, running through these halls chanting kill Nancy and \\\\nhang Mike Pence and even hanging a noose outside the building, \\\\nthese rioters battering Capitol Police Officers and forcing the \\\\nMembers of Congress and their staffs to go into hiding, \\\\nsquatting in spaces under desks or in closets, that is \\\\npolitical violence.\\\\n    This assassination attempt, as horrific as it is, should \\\\nsurprise no one. You would think a political party that almost \\\\nlost their Presidential Candidate through an act of political \\\\nviolence would have something to say about the way their \\\\nleaders keep talking about the next election. Donald Trump has \\\\nwarned there will be a ``blood bath&#x27;&#x27; if he loses. The \\\\nRepublican of Ohio State, Senator George Lang said just last \\\\nweek at a rally for J.D. Vance that,\\\\n\\\\n        He is afraid that a civil war might be necessary if Republicans \\\\n        lose the November election.\\\\n\\\\nThe President of the right-wing think tank and Project 2025 \\\\nleader of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, said on \\\\nStephen Bannon&#x27;s podcast,\\\\n\\\\n        We are in the process of the second American Revolution which \\\\n        will remain bloodless if the left allows us to be.\\\\n\\\\nRepublican former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said in August of \\\\nlast year of Trump&#x27;s indictments,\\\\n\\\\n        You want us to be in civil war? Because that is what is going \\\\n        to happen. We are not going to keep putting up with this. We do \\\\n        need to rise up and take our country back.\\\\n\\\\n    I could go on, but it is more and more of the same and to \\\\nhear nothing from the other side of the aisle in this room \\\\nabout these statements. You support a blood bath, if you don&#x27;t \\\\nget the election outcome you want? You justify violence if the \\\\nleft does not agree with you? What exactly has preoccupied this \\\\nRepublican Majority where their allies threaten violence to \\\\ntheir political enemies, real and imagined?\\\\n    We have chased down baseless conspiracy theories designed \\\\nsolely to influence the 2024 election in favor of Donald Trump. \\\\nWe have spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours of \\\\nstaff time and more than 100 transcribed interviews chasing \\\\nfalse accusations against President Biden supporting an \\\\nimpeachment effort that seemed designed to fail and hunting for \\\\na smoking gun that simply does not exist.\\\\n    Instead of admitting that these investigations found no \\\\ncorruption, coercion or unethical behavior for the Biden \\\\nAdministration, Republicans chose to just dig deeper and spend \\\\nmore money. Imagine what could have happened if we had spent \\\\nthese thousands of hours of staff time and those millions of \\\\ntaxpayer dollars addressing even one aspect of the political \\\\nviolence that now threatens our country. Perhaps, had this \\\\nRepublican majority lifted a finger to help a Nation that is \\\\nawash in guns, the assassin in Butler would not have had such \\\\neasy access to the weapon he used to fire on that crowd.\\\\n    Director Wray, your agency is responsible for addressing \\\\nsome of the most serious issues of our time. The Bureau fights \\\\ngun violence which claims the lives of 40,000 Americans every \\\\nyear. It protects election security from growing threats from \\\\nmalign foreign actors who are working tirelessly to influence \\\\nour elections. It protects against domestic terrorists and \\\\nviolent extremists who have been a growing threat in recent \\\\nyears and have carried out horrific mass shootings and deadly \\\\nevents around the country and so, so much more.\\\\n    I apologize to you, Director, that instead of supporting \\\\nyou in these missions in the 118th Congress, some of my \\\\ncolleagues have instead hindered your work, maligned your \\\\nagents, and called to abolish and defund your agency, all for \\\\npolitical gain. It is despicable, especially from the party \\\\nthat claims to ``back the blue.&#x27;&#x27; I know that you and your many \\\\nagents and employees have paid the price to these baseless \\\\nattacks. I know you have faced a barrage of threats, distrust, \\\\nand vitriol from the public as a result of these wild, \\\\npolitically driven conspiracies. I know it has become even more \\\\ndangerous and difficult for you to come to work each day. I may \\\\nnot agree with you on everything, but I sincerely thank you and \\\\nevery employee in your agency who continues to protect our \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    The FBI is vital to keeping America safe and I pray that \\\\ntoday we can focus on the real, substantive work of the agency. \\\\nIt is the least we owe our country in these times. I yield \\\\nback.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. Without objection, \\\\nall other opening statements will be included in the record.\\\\n    We will now introduce today&#x27;s witness.\\\\n    The Honorable Christopher Wray has been the Director of the \\\\nFBI since 2017. He previously served as the Assistant Attorney \\\\nGeneral for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, \\\\nthe Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General, and Associate \\\\nDeputy Attorney General, and as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the \\\\nNorthern District of Georgia. Again, Director Wray, you have \\\\nbeen here many times. We appreciate you being here today. We \\\\nlook forward to your testimony and answering our questions.\\\\n    We will begin by swearing you in. Would you please rise and \\\\nraise your right hand? Do you swear or affirm under penalty of \\\\nperjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and \\\\ncorrect to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief \\\\nso help you God?\\\\n    Let the record reflect that the witness has answered in the \\\\naffirmative. Thank you. Please be seated. We have votes coming \\\\nin about 10 minutes, but we definitely want to get through your \\\\nopening statement as far as we can and this is going to be an \\\\ninteresting day on Capitol Hill with the Prime Minister of \\\\nIsrael here as well.\\\\n    So, Director Wray, you are recognized for your opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n\\\\n           STATEMENT OF THE HON. CHRISTOPHER A. WRAY\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Good morning, Chair Jordan, Ranking Member \\\\nNadler, and the Members of the Committee. I want to begin by \\\\noffering my condolences on the passing of Representative \\\\nJackson Lee who served the people of Texas in this body and on \\\\nthis Committee for so long.\\\\n    Thank you all, for your support of our efforts to protect \\\\nthe American people and uphold the Constitution. I am proud to \\\\nbe here today representing the 38,000 special agents, \\\\nintelligence analysts, and professional staff who make up the \\\\nFBI, men and women who everyday work relentlessly to counter \\\\nthe most complex threat environment I have seen in my tenure as \\\\nFBI Director and maybe in my entire career in law enforcement.\\\\n    Before I go any further, I also want to acknowledge and \\\\noffer my deepest condolences to the victims of the horrific \\\\nassassination attempt in Butler County. To the friends and \\\\nfamily of Corey Comperatore, who by all accounts lost his life \\\\nprotecting others from danger, to the other victims, two of \\\\nwhom were critically wounded, and of course, to President \\\\nTrump, former President Trump and his family.\\\\n    As I have said from the beginning, the attempted \\\\nassassination of the former President was an attack on our \\\\ndemocracy and our democratic process and we will not and do not \\\\ntolerate political violence of any kind, especially a \\\\ndespicable account of this magnitude. I want to assure you and \\\\nthe American people that the men and women of the FBI will \\\\ncontinue to work tirelessly to get to the bottom of what \\\\nhappened. We are bringing all the resources of the FBI to bear, \\\\nboth criminal and national security.\\\\n    Now, there is a whole lot of work underway and still a lot \\\\nof work to do. Our understanding of what happened and why will \\\\ncontinue to evolve, but we are going to leave no stone \\\\nunturned. The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI&#x27;s \\\\ninvestigation is very much ongoing to that point.\\\\n    I also want to acknowledge that I recognize both the \\\\ncongressional and the public interest in this case and the \\\\nimportance of this investigation to the American people. I \\\\nunderstand there are a lot of open questions. So, while the \\\\ninvestigation is very much ongoing and our assessments of the \\\\nshooter and his actions continue to evolve, my hope here today \\\\nis to do my best to provide you with all the information I can \\\\ngive where we are at this point.\\\\n    I have been saying for some time now that we are living in \\\\nan elevated threat environment, and tragically, the Butler \\\\nCounty assassination attempt is another example, a particularly \\\\nheinous and very public one of what I have been talking about. \\\\nIt also reinforces our need at the FBI and our ongoing \\\\ncommitment to stay focused on the threats, on the mission, and \\\\non the people we do the work with and the people we do the work \\\\nfor. Everyday, all across this country, and indeed around the \\\\nworld, the men and women of the FBI are doing just that, \\\\nworking around the clock to counter the threats we face.\\\\n    Just in the last year, for example, in California, the FBI \\\\nand our partners targeted an organized crime syndicate \\\\nresponsible for trafficking fentanyl, meth, and cocaine, all \\\\nacross North America. We charged the Mexican-based suppliers \\\\nwho brought the drugs into the United States, a network of \\\\nCanada-based truck drivers who delivered the drugs, and the \\\\ndistributors in the United States who spread the poison into \\\\nour communities. Staying on threats emanating from the border, \\\\nI have warned for some time now about the threat that foreign \\\\nterrorists may seek to exploit our Southwest border or some \\\\nother port of entry to advance a plot against Americans.\\\\n    Just last month, for instance, the Bureau and our Joint \\\\nTerrorism Task Force has worked with ICE in multiple cities \\\\nacross the country as several individuals with suspected \\\\ninternational terrorist ties were arrested using ICE&#x27;s \\\\nimmigration authorities. Leading up to those arrests, hundreds \\\\nof FBI employees dedicated countless hours to understanding the \\\\nthreat and identify additional individuals of concern.\\\\n    Now, the physical security of the border is, of course, not \\\\nin the FBI&#x27;s lane, but as the threat has escalated, we are \\\\nworking with our partners in law enforcement and the \\\\nintelligence community to find and stop foreign terrorists who \\\\nwould harm Americans and our interests. As concerning as the \\\\nknown or suspected terrorists encountered at the border are, \\\\nperhaps even more concerning is those we do not yet know about, \\\\nbecause they provided fake documents or because we didn&#x27;t have \\\\ninformation connecting them to terrorism at the time they \\\\narrived in the United States.\\\\n    Staying ahead of today&#x27;s threats demands that we work \\\\ntogether and for the FBI that means doubling down on our \\\\npartnerships, especially with State and local law enforcement. \\\\nWhether it is working through our hundreds of Joint Terrorism \\\\nTask Forces to build outsource networks, to identify those who \\\\nslipped through the cracks or targeting the worst of the worst \\\\nresponsible for the violence that still plagues far too many \\\\ncommunities, to our Safe Streets Task Forces, we are taking the \\\\nfight to the cartels responsible for trafficking the dangerous \\\\ndrugs like fentanyl pouring into our country and claiming \\\\ncountless American lives.\\\\n    Staying ahead of the threat also means continuing to \\\\ndisrupt the cyber criminals ravaging businesses, large and \\\\nsmall, and confronting Nation States like China targeting our \\\\ninnovation and our critical infrastructure. At the Bureau, we \\\\nare proud to work side by side with our brothers and sisters in \\\\nFederal, State, and local law enforcement, our partners in the \\\\nintelligence community, and others around the world to fulfill \\\\nour commitment to keep Americans safe.\\\\n    Now, on Friday, the FBI will celebrate its 116th \\\\nAnniversary, 116 years of protecting the American people and \\\\nupholding the Constitution, 116 years of working with our \\\\npartners to safeguard the communities we serve, 116 years of \\\\ninnovating to stay ahead of the complex, evolving and very real \\\\nthreats out there. I am proud of the legacy the men and women \\\\nof the FBI have built and all they have accomplished for the \\\\nAmerican people.\\\\n    So, if I may, as we approach this week&#x27;s anniversary, I \\\\nwould just like to say to all those who are part of the FBI \\\\nfamily, from our current employees to our formers, and to our \\\\npartners across law enforcement and the intelligence community, \\\\nthank you. Thank you for dedicating your lives to this country \\\\nand to its people. It is both humbling and an honor to serve \\\\nalongside you and I look forward to the work we are going to \\\\ncontinue to do together. With that, thank you again for having \\\\nme, and I look forward to our discussion.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of the Hon. Wray follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chair Jordan. Thank you, Director Wray. We will now proceed \\\\nunder the five-minute rule. The gentleman from North Carolina \\\\nis recognized for five minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Director Wray, I am way \\\\ndown here, and I appreciate the Chair giving me this because I \\\\nhave got to leave but let me ask this question. Why doesn&#x27;t the \\\\nFBI disclose to the American people all the investigative \\\\ndetail and evidence that you are gathering as it is gathered?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we have tried to be transparent with both \\\\nCongress and the American people as we are going along in the \\\\ninvestigation, frankly, unusually so for an ongoing \\\\ninvestigation given the sheer nature of it. We have provided a \\\\nlot of information. I expect to continue to provide \\\\ninformation. I expect to be able to provide some additional \\\\ninformation here today in response to your questions and your \\\\ncolleagues, but part of the issue is that as like in any \\\\ninvestigation, as we proceed, facts evolve. Our understanding \\\\nof what somebody said turns out to have more context than we \\\\ndidn&#x27;t have before. We have additional leads out there. So, \\\\npart of our goal is not just to respect the ongoing \\\\ninvestigation process, but also to make sure that we don&#x27;t \\\\nprematurely provide information that then two days later turns \\\\nout to be different than what told people because that is very \\\\nmuch kind of a natural part of any investigation.\\\\n    Mr. Bishop. So, did Crooks fire eight shots?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We have recovered eight cartridges on the roof.\\\\n    Mr. Bishop. Why was Crooks allowed to get off eight shots?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, that, is something we are still digging \\\\ninto. Again, maybe this is a good place for me to make clear \\\\nthe different investigations that are going on. So, certainly, \\\\nI understand--\\\\n    Mr. Bishop. Well, given that I have only got three minutes \\\\nleft, I am really interested because I appreciate your \\\\ninvitation. You said you are prepared to disclose things as \\\\nquestions are asked. So, I don&#x27;t want to waste time. I just \\\\nwant to get to the questions that might--and as many Members \\\\nthat can ask questions that you will answer. I actually think \\\\nyou--I would be glad for you to go on soliloquy, frankly, and \\\\ntell us what you know. I think the American people want to \\\\nknow.\\\\n    Why was President Trump not kept off the stage?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We don&#x27;t know the answer to that, but I want to \\\\nbe clear, and this is important because I think it goes to the \\\\nquestions that I can and cannot answer. Our investigation, the \\\\nFBI&#x27;s mandate, is focused on the shooter and all things related \\\\nto his attack. Now, obviously, I understand very much the \\\\nintense interest and focus on the Secret Service&#x27;s performance, \\\\nactions, decisionmaking, et cetera. There are two separate \\\\nafter-action reviews that the DHS Inspector General and the \\\\noutside independent panel that&#x27;s been convened to focus on \\\\nthis. Now, our investigation--\\\\n    Mr. Bishop. Here is the problem. We are out 13 days, and \\\\nyou say we have been disclosing. We had the colonel from the \\\\nPennsylvania State Police in front of Homeland yesterday. He \\\\nwas quite candid. He disclosed to us that Butler Emergency \\\\nServices Unit personnel were posted into the windows on the \\\\nsecond floor of the AGR Building, that they left there to go \\\\npursue the person that they spotted, Crooks; that they texted a \\\\nphoto of Crooks to the PSP representative in the Command \\\\nCenter. That information was relayed to the United States \\\\nSecret Service. They asked that it be texted to someone else. \\\\nThat was many minutes before President Trump took the stand.\\\\n    What we don&#x27;t know is why they were not keeping him off the \\\\nstand? To the extent--I know we always hear when there is a \\\\ncriminal investigation, you have to wait for that to develop, \\\\nbut do you have any reason--do you have any other target in \\\\nyour criminal investigation other than Crooks who is dead?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We are investigating the shooter both to \\\\ndetermine his motive and his preparations and activities before \\\\nthe shooting, but also to make sure whether or not there are \\\\nany coconspirators, accomplices--\\\\n    Mr. Bishop. At this point, have you developed any evidence \\\\nto suggest that there are any accomplices or cooperators or \\\\nassisters?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Not at this time, but again, the investigation is \\\\nongoing.\\\\n    Mr. Bishop. Here is the thing. Why we wait, maybe for \\\\nmonths, and I hate to say this because I am not trying to take \\\\na pot shot, the country went for years with the understanding \\\\nthat the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation as \\\\noffered by respected former Intel Officials and the whole time \\\\nthe FBI had the laptop and then let that happen in public until \\\\nfinally offering testimony in the case. To the degree we wait \\\\nto hear as a country and as a Congress, what has happened in \\\\nthis event, because the FBI&#x27;s conducting an investigation it \\\\nprovides quarter for the U.S. Secret Service not perhaps to \\\\nreckon with the problems that are obvious to everyone.\\\\n    So, let me get a couple in, well, I have 13 more seconds, \\\\none more question perhaps. Senator Grassley says the records of \\\\nthe day show that there was a counter unmanned aerial \\\\nsurveillance operator onsite. Was there? Why did that person \\\\nnot prevent Crooks from being able to use a drone?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, again, questions about the Secret Service&#x27;s \\\\nperformance are better directed to those other reviews. What I \\\\ncan tell you when it comes to drones, is that Crooks himself \\\\nhad a drone and I am prepared to answer questions here today \\\\nabout the shooter and his use of the drone, for example.\\\\n    Mr. Bishop. My time has expired.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The Ranking Member \\\\nis recognized for five minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. As I said in my opening \\\\nstatement, political violence is a scourge and entirely \\\\nunacceptable no matter the source or the target. Last October, \\\\nthe far-right conspiracy theorists broke into Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s \\\\nhome and bludgeoned her husband. Prominent Republicans mocked \\\\nthe attack and promoted conspiracy theories about it.\\\\n    Last August, an armed Utah man who threatened to kill \\\\nPresident Biden was killed as FBI agents attempted to serve a \\\\nwarrant on him hours before President Biden landed in this \\\\nState. Some on the right claim that the man was simply a \\\\n``Second Amendment enthusiast.&#x27;&#x27; In recent weeks and months, \\\\nthose on the right have repeatedly quoted the civil war with an \\\\nOhio State Senator saying that if Republicans lose the election \\\\n``it is going to take a civil war to save the country and it \\\\nwill be saved.&#x27;&#x27; The president of The Heritage Foundation \\\\nlikewise said that,\\\\n\\\\n        We are in the process of the second American Revolution which \\\\n        will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\\\\n\\\\n    Director, it is obviously important that we respect First \\\\nAmendment protection, but there is clearly a point that with \\\\nsome violent rhetoric crosses over into threats of violence or \\\\nleads to actual violence. Could you describe how the FBI looks \\\\nat this relationship between rhetoric and action and what you \\\\nhave seen around the country?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I appreciate the question, and this is an \\\\nissue that I&#x27;ve been talking about for some time. In our view \\\\nthere is a right way and a wrong way under the First Amendment \\\\nto express your views no matter how passionate or even angry \\\\nyou are. Violence and threats of violence is not the right way. \\\\nWe don&#x27;t care what you&#x27;re upset about or who you&#x27;re upset with, \\\\nfrom the FBI&#x27;s perspective when it turns to violence and \\\\nthreats of violence, that&#x27;s when we have to draw the line. \\\\nThat&#x27;s when we get engaged.\\\\n    There is an alarming phenomenon that we&#x27;ve seen over the \\\\nlast several years of that kind of passion and heated rhetoric \\\\nturning into actual violence and threats of violence. We&#x27;ve \\\\nseen it against public officials of all sorts, we&#x27;ve seen it \\\\nagainst law enforcement. The number of officers shot and killed \\\\nin the line of duty in this country is frankly outrageous and \\\\nalarming. I know that because every time an officer is shot and \\\\nkilled anywhere in this country since the day I started as the \\\\nFBI Director, I personally call the Chief or the Sheriff to \\\\nexpress my condolences and to talk to them about the victim&#x27;s \\\\nfamily.\\\\n    The number of those shootings that are ambush-related, \\\\nmeaning somebody is targeting law enforcement because they&#x27;re \\\\nlaw enforcement, is particularly alarming. I have made around \\\\n400 of those phone calls. It&#x27;s almost every five days that a \\\\nlaw enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty. That is \\\\nan example of the kind of ways in which passions and heated \\\\nrhetoric can bubble over into violence.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you. Members of Congress, their families, \\\\nand their staff have witnessed an alarming rise in threats \\\\nagainst them. I appreciate the work your agency has done to \\\\ninvestigate and address these threats, but I am concerned that \\\\nwe do not seem to be stemming the tide. What is the FBI doing \\\\nto ensure that the Members of Congress, their families, and \\\\ntheir staffs are safe?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, we have a very close relationship with the \\\\nCapitol Police, and we have members of the Capitol Police, for \\\\nexample, who are on some of our task forces. We share \\\\nintelligence information about things that we&#x27;re seeing, trends \\\\nthat we&#x27;re seeing with Capitol Police and others in law \\\\nenforcement. Obviously, if we have specific information about \\\\nan effort to target a Member of Congress, then we&#x27;re getting \\\\nwith Capitol Police in a much more specific way. Those are some \\\\nof the things that we&#x27;re doing.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you. Now, Director, your office is \\\\nleading the investigation into the attempted assassination of \\\\nDonald Trump. Republicans in Congress including Members of this \\\\nCommittee have repeatedly called for defunding the FBI. What \\\\nimpact would the defunding, or even just limiting your funding \\\\nhave on the FBI&#x27;s ability to conduct this and other \\\\ninvestigations?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I understand that there are heated views, \\\\nopinions about us, just like there are about every institution \\\\nin today&#x27;s America, but cutting our funding is incredibly \\\\nshortsighted. The people it really hurts are State and local \\\\nlaw enforcement and the American people we&#x27;re all sworn to \\\\nprotect.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you. During my remaining time I want to \\\\nturn to a different matter. In recent days Republican Members \\\\nof Congress have attacked Presumptive Democratic Presidential \\\\nNominee Kamala Harris as a, quote, ``DEI candidate,&#x27;&#x27; which \\\\npresumably is code for woman and person of color. It is not a \\\\nnew theme for them. In May, Chair Jordan wrote to you claiming \\\\nthat because of DEI initiatives the FBI is no longer hiring, \\\\nquote, ``the best and brightest candidates to fill the position \\\\nof special agent.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    With the remaining time--with my remaining time, Director \\\\nWray, can you please answer the following questions? Is it true \\\\nthat hiring women and people of color means that FBI is no \\\\nlonger hiring the best and the brightest to serve as law \\\\nenforcement officers? Is there any evidence that women and \\\\npeople of color are less effective in law enforcement roles? \\\\nWhat message does it send to perspective applicants when their \\\\nleaders demean them and make judgments about them based solely \\\\non their race or gender?\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The witness may respond.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, any notion that we have lowered our \\\\nstandards, our hiring standards is just not accurate. In fact, \\\\nour standards are as competitive and selective as ever. We have \\\\ntens of thousands of people applying. Our selection rate is \\\\nabout 3.1 percent, which is more selective than just about any \\\\nuniversity in the country. Most of our applicants--I think \\\\nsomething like 50 percent of them are coming from military or \\\\nlaw enforcement backgrounds. About 50 percent of them also have \\\\nadvanced degrees. The average age is around 31, which means \\\\nthey&#x27;re bringing a wealth of personal and professional \\\\nexperience when they arrive.\\\\n    To suggest that those people because of efforts related to \\\\ndiversity or anything like that are less qualified, frankly is \\\\nnot at all consistent with what I see having visited all our \\\\nfield offices and seen these young people in action, I think is \\\\nan insult to those hardworking men and women who&#x27;ve signed up \\\\nto dedicate their lives for this country.\\\\n    Mr. Nadler. Thank you, director. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Director, let me go back to where Mr. Bishop was. Tell me \\\\nabout the drone. You acted like you wanted to fill us in on \\\\nthat. Fill us in.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, we have recovered a drone that the shooter \\\\nappears to have used. It&#x27;s being exploited and analyzed by the \\\\nFBI lab. The drone was recovered in his vehicle. So, at the \\\\ntime of the shooting the drone was in his vehicle with the \\\\ncontroller.\\\\n    In addition, our investigation has uncovered--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Do you know what time of day he flew it and \\\\nif he flew it on the day of--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, in addition, it appears that around 3:50-4:00 \\\\np.m., in that window on the day of the shooting that the \\\\nshooter was flying the drone around the area--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Two hours--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I want to be clear, when I say the area, not over \\\\nthe stage and that part of the area itself, but I would say \\\\nabout 200 yards, give or take, away from that.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We think, but we do not know--so again, this is \\\\none of those things that&#x27;s qualified because of our ongoing \\\\nreview--that he was live streaming, viewing the footage from \\\\nagain about 11 minutes in around the 3:50-4:00 p.m. range.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Two hours before he is flying a drone in the \\\\nvicinity of the rally?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, about 200 yards away. Yes.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK. Two hundred yards? That is important \\\\ninformation. What about the bombs that we have heard about in \\\\nthe shooter&#x27;s car?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, again, the FBI lab is exploiting those \\\\nexplosive devices. We&#x27;ve recovered three devices: Two in his \\\\nvehicle and one back in his residence.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Are these what you would call--your experts \\\\nwould call sophisticated operations or--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I think--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. I don&#x27;t know. That is what I have been told \\\\nby people who have some understanding of this area.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, I think it&#x27;s--we&#x27;ve seen more sophisticated \\\\nand less. I would say these are relatively--again, key word \\\\nrelatively--crude devices themselves, but they did have the \\\\nability to be detonated remotely. So, to that point, in \\\\naddition to the two devices that we recovered out of his \\\\nvehicle there were receivers for those two explosive devices \\\\nwith the devices. Then on the shooter himself when he was \\\\nkilled by law enforcement he had a transmitter with him.\\\\n    Now, I do want to add one important point here is at the \\\\nmoment it looks to us--again, ongoing review, and I can&#x27;t say \\\\nthat too many times--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Right, right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. --at the moment it looks because of the on/off \\\\nposition on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate \\\\nthose devices from the roof, it would not have worked.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That doesn&#x27;t mean the explosives weren&#x27;t \\\\ndangerous.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. I am sure we are going to get into all these \\\\nsubjects a little bit later as well. Tell us what you can about \\\\nthe encrypted platforms we have heard about.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, one of the things that we&#x27;re drilling into \\\\nhard with the shooter in an effort to try to learn more about \\\\nhis state of mind, his motive, his ideology, his contacts, and \\\\neverything else is to look at all his devices, any social media \\\\naccounts he had, et cetera.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Right, right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. One of the things we&#x27;ve learned in finally \\\\ngetting into his phone, which was also a significant technical \\\\nchallenge from an encryption perspective--but in addition, once \\\\nwe got on the phone it turned out he was using some encrypted \\\\nmessaging application.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Again, the same question relative to the \\\\nbombs, was this pretty sophisticated or this is kind of the \\\\nnorm you see with folks in similar situations, or how would you \\\\ndescribe it?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, on this subject I would say this is \\\\nunfortunately now become very commonplace and it&#x27;s a real \\\\nchallenge for not just the FBI, but State and local law \\\\nenforcement all over this country.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Tell me exactly the scope of--does the scope \\\\nof your investigation include what I call that critical five \\\\nminutes from when the--6:09 when--this is based I think on \\\\ninformation you have given to Congress--6:09 when the shooter \\\\nis identified on the roof, and 6:14 when President Trump is \\\\nultimately escorted off, and all that happens, the shots that \\\\ntake place in between there? Do you have access to the \\\\ncommunications that were going on at the time in that critical \\\\nfive minutes?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, our investigation--when you say scope, our \\\\ninvestigation includes that timeframe, although focused again \\\\non the shooter himself and as part of that--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Understand. The shooter is involved in that--\\\\nhe is obviously involved in that timeframe.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Correct. As part of that, as part of our focus, \\\\nour investigation of the shooter and the attack, of course, we \\\\nare interviewing law enforcement from the scene, because those \\\\nare some of the most significant witnesses. We&#x27;re obviously \\\\ngetting access to their materials and that kind of things. The \\\\nSecret Service has been fully cooperative.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. You are getting access to any--you have \\\\naccess to the communications that exist there?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That exact question I don&#x27;t--as I sit here at the \\\\nmoment, I don&#x27;t know the exact answer to that question, but I \\\\nknow the Secret Service has been cooperative with us.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Congress would like access to those \\\\ncommunications as well. Not just that five minutes, although I \\\\nthink that is the critical timeframe. There are lots of \\\\ncommunications we would love to have access to as well.\\\\n    I see my time is up and they have called votes on the \\\\nfloor. I think there are about six minutes left in votes. So, \\\\nthe Committee will stand in recess until approximately 10 \\\\nminutes after votes conclude on the House floor.\\\\n    [Recess.]\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The Committee will come to order.\\\\n    The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from California for \\\\nfive minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Wray, for being here with us today. \\\\nBefore I ask anything let me just echo the comments made by \\\\nothers and especially the Ranking Member decrying the State of \\\\npolitical violence in this country. It is completely \\\\nunacceptable. We have a democratic system that allows us to \\\\ndisagree, but not to take those disagreements to violence. That \\\\nis what we have elections for.\\\\n    I want to also thank you and all the FBI for the work that \\\\nyou do and frankly the abuse, unwarranted abuse and criticism \\\\nthat have been directed to you by conspiracy theorists and \\\\nothers. It doesn&#x27;t make your hard job any easier and I want you \\\\nto know that many of us notice that and appreciate the work \\\\nthat you and your team are doing.\\\\n    Let me just ask a couple of quick questions: First, many of \\\\nus are interested in the motives of the shooter here. When it \\\\nis an assault on a political figure you immediately assume \\\\nthere is a political motive. That may be the case here; we \\\\ndon&#x27;t know yet.\\\\n    I was interested in what you are seeing on his phone. The \\\\npress has reported that he had pictures not only of Mr. Trump, \\\\nbut of Mr. Biden, and various other Members and political \\\\nfigures. Can you discern was there an element of mainly \\\\nRepublicans, mainly Democrats? Was it all over the board? Can \\\\nyou enlighten us about that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, this is a place where it&#x27;s particularly \\\\nimportant for me to reiterate the caveat that I&#x27;ve included \\\\nbefore because in this instance in particular we have a lot of \\\\nlegal process out for additional accounts, and things like that \\\\nthe shooter is associated with. So, we&#x27;re hoping to learn more. \\\\nWe&#x27;re still exploiting a number of the digital devices.\\\\n    Ms. Lofgren. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that we do not yet have \\\\na clear picture of his motive. I think it&#x27;s important for me to \\\\nexplain because I understand of course why everybody wants to \\\\nknow the answers to those questions.\\\\n    Often in an investigation from interviewing people that the \\\\nsubject was in close contact with, looking at the individual&#x27;s \\\\nsocial media accounts, messages, often things--physical \\\\nevidence in the person&#x27;s residence. You might see a manifesto, \\\\nthings like that. We&#x27;re not seeing that yet, but we are digging \\\\nhard because this is one of the central questions for us.\\\\n    What I can say is that the shooter appears to have done a \\\\nlot of searches of public figures in general. So far, we&#x27;re \\\\nseeing news articles and things like that, and so the images \\\\nthat have been reported about. Really what we&#x27;re talking about \\\\nthere are when you do a news search of an article--\\\\n    Ms. Lofgren. I see.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. --the image appears in the cache as opposed to \\\\nlike a search for that specific individual.\\\\n    Ms. Lofgren. For that specific person.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again, I really want to be clear that&#x27;s a place \\\\nthat we&#x27;re doing a lot of work right now. So, more to come on \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Ms. Lofgren. Well, I thank you for that clarification. We \\\\nare interested also in the role of access to weapons when it \\\\ncomes to this terrible crime. The shooter used a semiautomatic \\\\nrifle, really a weapon of war that sadly has also been used in \\\\nmass shootings around the country including in my own district. \\\\nIt seems to me that the assault weapons ban that was once in \\\\nplace has to be a part of the national answer to curbing the \\\\nepidemic of gun violence in America.\\\\n    I wonder if you could, with your help, Director Wray, \\\\nunderstand a few aspects of the investigation. It is my \\\\nunderstanding that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, \\\\nand Explosives, ATF, was quickly able to trace the gun, the \\\\ngun&#x27;s purchaser, using records from an out-of-business gun \\\\nstore, records that the government is required to collect. Some \\\\nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested \\\\nthat collection should stop. There have been efforts to \\\\ndigitize it which have been resisted.\\\\n    Can you tell us about how the origin of this gun purchase \\\\nwas discovered, and the technology used?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I guess what I can say is we located a \\\\nnumber of firearms associated with the shooter and his family. \\\\nI think it was a total of 14 in the house. The weapon that he \\\\nused for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that \\\\nwas purchased legally, that he--it&#x27;s my understanding \\\\nacquired--I think bought actually from his father who was the \\\\none who originally bought it, again legally.\\\\n    Ms. Lofgren. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Chair, my time is expired so I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from California is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. Thank you.\\\\n    Director, I will try to ask questions that are answerable, \\\\ntoo. I think that has been done pretty well on both sides.\\\\n    You do the advanced threat assessment and deliver that \\\\ninformation as to the general threat, and then specifics as to \\\\nprotected people to the Secret Service. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, sort of. The Secret Service does a threat \\\\nassessment, but they&#x27;re doing that based on intelligence that \\\\nthey receive from a number of sources, including of course the \\\\nFBI. So, whenever we have threat information related to a \\\\nparticular individual or protectee, then we share it with the \\\\nSecret Service at a number of levels.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. So, you are a participant but ultimately the \\\\nresponsibility for threat assessment as to these individuals \\\\nbelong to the Secret Service?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well again, the threat assessment for the \\\\nindividual belongs to the Secret Service, but we are an \\\\nimportant part of that because we share threat information if \\\\nwe have any. They get threat information from a variety of \\\\nsources.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. OK. You get them from the same variety of \\\\nsources? They have got no sources that are excluded from the \\\\nFBI, do they?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;m not aware of any that are excluded from the \\\\nFBI, but they may receive information that comes directly to \\\\nthem that didn&#x27;t come to us.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. Sure. OK. Director, do you believe that the \\\\nformer President Trump was a high-risk threat under your \\\\nassessment?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I believe that former President Trump, \\\\nreally frankly like any President or former President, is a \\\\nvery high-profile figure and attracts a lot of unfortunately \\\\nthe kind of threats that we&#x27;ve been talking about.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. So, it is fair to say--not on a scale of one to a \\\\nmillion with little nuances, but on a scale of 1-10, President \\\\nTrump&#x27;s risk was very similar to a current President, very \\\\nsimilar to--because he was the presumptive nominee and leading \\\\nin the polls, and so on that he was a high risk by any \\\\nstandard. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Certainly, there&#x27;s a reason why he had some much \\\\nprotection around him.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. OK. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the son of an \\\\nassassinated Senator and the nephew of an assassinated \\\\nPresident--would you say he was also as a Presidential \\\\ncandidate at significant risk?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again, I think any Presidential candidate raises \\\\nsome level of risk.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. It might vary from candidate to candidate.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. No, but it is clearly a risk. OK.\\\\n    So, in a nutshell the day before this attack President \\\\nTrump was documented not to have gotten on multiple occasions \\\\nfrom the Secret Service what they asked for. The day after it \\\\nlooks like they are getting more. The day before RFK had been \\\\ndenied by the President multiple times Secret Service \\\\nprotection. The day after he now has it.\\\\n    So, now my question is; is the actions of a 20-year-old \\\\nwith--a lone gunman on a roof sufficient to change the risk \\\\nassessment in your mind for President Trump and RFK, or are we \\\\njust realizing the threat that was always there and being more \\\\nappropriate in matching it?\\\\n    I know that is a little vague, but you have been at this \\\\nfor a long time. Hindsight is 20/20. Now that we have \\\\nhindsight, is it fair to say that giving Robert F. Kennedy, \\\\nJr., security, upping the security including drones overhead \\\\nsupport for the President--former President, these are things \\\\nthat in hindsight should have done the day before?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, let me try to answer your question this \\\\nway: Of course, as I said, the assessments of the level of \\\\nsecurity to be provided to individual protectees--\\\\n    Mr. Issa. No, I understand it is the Secret Service&#x27;s \\\\ndecision.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. What I would say to you is that--and I&#x27;ve been \\\\nsaying for quite some time, including in front of the \\\\nCommittees of this Congress, that we are in an elevated threat \\\\nenvironment, and we have been for some time. That comes from a \\\\nvariety of quarters. It is quite frankly a dangerous time to be \\\\na prominent public official.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. Well, in regard to that, the other side has spent \\\\na lot of time talking about what people in the right have said, \\\\nbut there was an attempted assassination on a Supreme Court \\\\nJustice. We have had the highest-ranking Senator on the other \\\\nside of this body saying that there were actions, that they \\\\nwere accountable.\\\\n    We have had multiple Members of Congress in both the House \\\\nand the Senate berating the character of members of the Supreme \\\\nCourt as a result of their decisions made, sometimes 6-3, \\\\nsometimes unanimous, whatever. Are those comments, not any one \\\\nof them, but are those comments and the generation of that sort \\\\nof, oh, this guy is bad for democracy, this Supreme Court \\\\nJustice is a threat to democracy--is that the kind of thing \\\\nthat raises the threat level and would you caution against \\\\nthat?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I do believe that we&#x27;ve seen an increase in \\\\nthreats of violence, which again, that&#x27;s the FBI&#x27;s lane, not \\\\nrhetoric, no matter how despicable or heated it is. Violence \\\\nand threats of violence, we have seen an uptick in threats \\\\ntoward judges, among other prominent public officials, \\\\nincluding as you say a case that we helped investigate \\\\ninvolving a threat to a sitting Supreme Court Justice.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. An attempt.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. An attempt. Correct. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. Yes, thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. It&#x27;s a reflection of a broader phenomenon that we \\\\nare seeing in this country where people--again, very \\\\npassionate. I respect that. Very angry. I respect that. There&#x27;s \\\\na right way and wrong way to express yourself when you&#x27;re \\\\nangry. Violence and threats of violence just can&#x27;t be it. \\\\nThat&#x27;s where we fit in. It&#x27;s not my role as FBI Director to \\\\ncall out particular people&#x27;s rhetoric. There&#x27;s a place for \\\\nthat, but that&#x27;s not my role as FBI Director. When it turns to \\\\nviolence and threats of violence, that has to be treated as \\\\nunacceptable and that&#x27;s the way we look at it.\\\\n    Mr. Issa. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Director, when did the FBI learn that Iran \\\\nwas threatening President Trump&#x27;s life?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I want to be a little bit careful here, not \\\\ntalk about specific classified information. We have been for \\\\nquite some time--and I&#x27;ll stick with what&#x27;s in the open record. \\\\nWe for some time, and I, in particular, for some time have been \\\\ncalling out the efforts by the Iranian government to attempt to \\\\nretaliate for the killing of Soleimani by going after current \\\\nor former prominent U.S. officials. We&#x27;ve had an indictment \\\\nagainst it.\\\\n    That we need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian \\\\nregime including right here in the United States. I expect that \\\\nwe&#x27;re going to see more of it, and I expect there will be more \\\\ncoming on that. I&#x27;m not aware of any threat information related \\\\nto protectees that wasn&#x27;t passed in a timely way, but I can&#x27;t \\\\nreally get into specifics here.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. It is the minority&#x27;s time here, but I just \\\\nfelt that was a question the Committee needed to understand. It \\\\nsounds like you have known that for a long time. That \\\\ninformation was conveyed to the Secret Service?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Any information related to threats against the \\\\nformer President, which again as we&#x27;ve talked about happens all \\\\ntoo often. It&#x27;s something that we have a whole process of. We \\\\nroutinely share with the Secret Service on a number of levels \\\\nin a timely way. To my knowledge that has consistently been \\\\nfollowed.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Thank you for being here, Director Wray. Director Wray, the \\\\nFBI is the independent law enforcement agency under the \\\\nDepartment of Justice, is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Does the FBI Director currently report to \\\\nanyone?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, you mean in a chain of command reporting \\\\nstructure kind of thing?\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, so the FBI is part of the Justice \\\\nDepartment. On the org chart you would see that the FBI \\\\nDirector, and it&#x27;s been true for decades, reports to the Deputy \\\\nAttorney General, who reports to the Attorney General. \\\\nObviously, reports in a communication sense. I report to any \\\\nnumber of people.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. As opposed to a micromanagement reporting \\\\nsystem?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Correct.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. You would take issue, would you not, with any \\\\nproposal that would change or alter that chain of command and \\\\nplace you, or place a FBI Director in the position of reporting \\\\ndirectly to the President, would you not? You would oppose \\\\nthat?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t think that would be a wise reporting \\\\nstructure. I think the structure that we&#x27;ve had for decades now \\\\nmakes sense. I think there&#x27;s a difference between independence \\\\nin a sort of organizational structure perspective and \\\\nindependence in terms of the way you do the work. Obviously, \\\\nthe FBI is part of the Justice Department.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Well reporting directly to the President would \\\\neliminate your independence, would it not?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t think it would help.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Yes. You are familiar with Project 2025, are \\\\nyou not?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;ve seen news reports about it. I&#x27;m not \\\\nparticularly familiar with it.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. You are aware that it is a game plan for \\\\nPresident Trump&#x27;s first 120 days in office, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;m not really familiar with the details. Again, \\\\nI&#x27;ve seen reporting about it.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Well, it is. It is. What he proposes to do is \\\\nto force the FBI Director to report directly to him. That is \\\\nwhat he wants to do within the first 120 days. He also wants to \\\\neliminate the position of FBI General Counsel. That is also set \\\\nforth in Project 2025. Would you recommend that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I think the FBI&#x27;s Office of General Counsel \\\\nserves an incredibly important role, including in terms of \\\\nadvising our workforce. We have 38,000 people. The idea of \\\\nhaving an organization like ours, an independent law \\\\nenforcement agency like ours that doesn&#x27;t have its own General \\\\nCounsel&#x27;s office doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Well, it would seem like any proposal that \\\\nwould force the Director to report to the President and then \\\\nthere would be no legal counsel for the Director of the FBI--\\\\nthat seems like it is an attempt to neuter the FBI, and render \\\\nit accountable only to the President. Isn&#x27;t that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, let me put it this way: I recognize that \\\\nthe FBI Director, this FBI Director and every FBI Director \\\\nbefore me, serves at the pleasure of the President. That&#x27;s part \\\\nof our system. I was appointed by President Trump. I respect \\\\nthat. I think that&#x27;s a part of our structure. Independence in \\\\nterms of how we do our work is what matters to me. We need to \\\\nbe able to do our work in a way that is free from political \\\\ninterference.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Well, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that by \\\\nreporting everything you do to the President and getting his \\\\nauthority and approval before you take action, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t think that would be a wise approach.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Then there is even a proposal to replace many \\\\nof those 38,000 dedicated civil servants who work for the FBI, \\\\nreplace them with a MAGA group that has pledged its allegiance \\\\nto Donald Trump. What danger would that bring to the FBI if \\\\nthat were to happen?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well again, I haven&#x27;t read or reviewed this thing \\\\nthat you&#x27;re referring to, but--\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Well, assuming what I say is true--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. --the FBI is made up of 38,000 dedicated career \\\\nlaw enforcement professionals. It has no political appointees \\\\nof any kind unless you count me as a nominee of the former \\\\nPresident.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. You don&#x27;t want that to change either, do you?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t think that should change. I think that \\\\nis--\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. You don&#x27;t want a bunch of MAGA loyalist being \\\\nthe employees of the FBI?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That is part of how we do our work. Right.\\\\n    We&#x27;re coming up 116 years of the FBI and that&#x27;s the way it \\\\nhas been for 116 years.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. It would be crazy to take 38,000 MAGA \\\\nloyalists and put them at the FBI. That is frightening. That is \\\\nwhat Project 2025 proposes. I am glad to know that you are not \\\\nwith that program. With that I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from Florida is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Was the shooter on the FBI&#x27;s radar in any way \\\\nprior to the assassination attempt?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We did not have any information about the \\\\nshooter. He was not in our holdings before the shooting.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. No communication in any chat rooms? No CIs or \\\\nconfidential human sources have had any interaction with--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. No. We&#x27;ve run a thorough search for the subject \\\\nthrough all our holdings and he was not in them anywhere.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Were there any FBI agents or informants present \\\\nat the Trump rally in Butler?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Not to my knowledge.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Mr. Jordan was talking to you about Iran. Were \\\\nlaw enforcement resources diverted from the protection of \\\\nPresident Trump to John Bolton, as a consequence of concern \\\\nthat Mr. Bolton might have been the target of Iranian malign \\\\nefforts?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That&#x27;s really a Secret Service decision. I don&#x27;t \\\\nknow the answer to that. That&#x27;s really something they would \\\\nknow better.\\\\n    What I can tell you is that there are a number of \\\\nindividuals--you mentioned one--who we have brought a case, a \\\\nspecific criminal case, for the Iranians targeting for \\\\nassassination, but how the Secret Service allocates--\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Are you going to get that answer to us, whether \\\\nor not resources were diverted from Trump to Bolton? Is that \\\\njust going to be part of your review?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I think that&#x27;s going to be part of the reviews by \\\\nthe Inspector, the Inspector General, and the after--\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. The Inspector General for DHS, right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. The DHS and the outside panel after action--\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Right. Got it. That&#x27;s an important point because \\\\nthe Inspector General for DHS has really fallen out of favor \\\\nwith the Administration because he&#x27;s been pointing out all the \\\\nproblems on the border with Mayorkas and Biden. We&#x27;re always \\\\nworried that they&#x27;re about to fire him, which would be a really \\\\nbad idea now that this role that you&#x27;ve identified is so \\\\ncritical. It would be a bad idea to fire the IG for DHS during \\\\nthe pendency of this, right, Mr. Director?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t think that would be a good idea.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. I&#x27;m with you on that.\\\\n    So, I want to zoom out a little bit. How often do you brief \\\\nPresident Biden?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. You mean on this specific case?\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. No, just generally. No, in your role as FBI \\\\nDirector.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know that I could give you a number.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Is it weekly, monthly, or daily?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. It&#x27;s not at a regular cadence. There have been \\\\ntimes when there have been months at a time when I haven&#x27;t, and \\\\nthen, there have been times when several days apart I have. \\\\nIt&#x27;s always with other people.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. The Vice President, is she typically there?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Often has been.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. OK. So, when did you notice his decline?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. In my interactions in my role, all my \\\\ninteractions with the current President have been completely \\\\nprofessional.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Right, but his cognitive decline. I&#x27;m not saying \\\\nhe treated you unprofessionally, just maybe not picking things \\\\nup as quickly as he used to.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again, I don&#x27;t meet with him very often, but what \\\\nyou&#x27;re describing is not something that I&#x27;ve observed during my \\\\ninteractions with him.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. We&#x27;ve had it observed so often that the Ranking \\\\nMember and Mr. Schiff on this Committee have said that he could \\\\nno longer continue as a candidate. So, since you&#x27;re the FBI \\\\nDirector, I was just sort of wondering who&#x27;s running the \\\\ncountry?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. My--\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. If something bad happened, you&#x27;d have to go \\\\nbrief President Biden about it right now, God forbid.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. On any number of occasions, I have briefed the \\\\nPresident, and as I said, those briefings have all been \\\\nuneventful and unremarkable.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Oh, I can imagine them being uneventful.\\\\n    In the work where the Vice President is also present, like \\\\nyou say there&#x27;s more than half the time there&#x27;s these briefings \\\\nshe&#x27;s there, too?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know if I said more than half the time. \\\\nCertainly, there have been times where she&#x27;s been present; \\\\nthere have been other times where she hasn&#x27;t.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. I take you at your word when you say this is the \\\\nmost complicated threat environment you&#x27;ve ever observed over a \\\\nlong career in law enforcement. I&#x27;m just kind of wondering, \\\\nwith this assassination attempt, with the invasion at our \\\\nborder, with all the Hamas that have been let in, that you&#x27;ve \\\\ntalked about and briefed about, is Biden up to it?\\\\n    If he&#x27;s not up to it, and you&#x27;re a guy who&#x27;s been regularly \\\\nbriefing him, who&#x27;s been in on this conspiracy to hide the real \\\\nJoe Biden from all of us for years? It never occurred to you \\\\nthat this guy wasn&#x27;t up to it in all these briefings you did?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. As I said, my briefings with the President have \\\\nall been completely fine. I briefed.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Were they between 10 a.m.-4 p.m.?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. He&#x27;s asked questions. There hasn&#x27;t been anything \\\\nof note in the area that you&#x27;re talking about.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. Yes. Did you ever have to brief him before 10 \\\\na.m. or after 4 p.m.? We hear those are his good hours.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Certainly, the times that I have briefed have \\\\nincluded outside those hours.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. All right. OK. I just think the American people \\\\nwant to know how we got to this point with someone who&#x27;s so \\\\ndiminished, his own party has, basically, put him out to \\\\npasture. Since you had close proximity and the Vice President \\\\nhad close proximity, I&#x27;m just wondering if you are being \\\\nstraight with all us about how things were going with him. I \\\\nguess we&#x27;ll have to figure that out.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. You can count on me to be straight with you, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Gaetz. We&#x27;ll see.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Thank you.\\\\n    First, I&#x27;d like to recognize the unfortunate fact that our \\\\ncolleague and my colleague side-by-side with me for many, many \\\\nyears\\\\nin this Committee, Sheila Jackson Lee is no longer with us. She \\\\nwas a great Member and a force for America, and her loss is \\\\nfelt greatly.\\\\n    Second, I&#x27;d like to say to the FBI Director that there were \\\\nsome remarks made when you were introduced, peremptory remarks, \\\\nsaying that people don&#x27;t have great faith in the FBI now, et \\\\ncetera, et cetera, et cetera. I have great faith in the FBI, \\\\nand I think most of us on this side of the aisle do. We \\\\nappreciate your work and appreciate your being here.\\\\n    Some on the other side of the aisle have cast aspersions on \\\\nthe FBI and on law enforcement. If they don&#x27;t want to support \\\\nlaw enforcement, that&#x27;s their business, but I support law \\\\nenforcement, and the FBI is the top rank of law enforcement in \\\\nour country. So, I thank you and all your people that work with \\\\nyou.\\\\n    Third, there&#x27;s been some questions about the FBI maybe \\\\nbeing weaponized. Did President Biden ever ask you to get \\\\ninvolved in the case in Orlando, Florida, where Kevin McCarthy \\\\nsays that Mr. Gaetz was investigated for some sexual \\\\ninvolvement with a 17-year-old girl? Did the President or \\\\nanybody in the Democratic Party, as Mr. McCarthy has suggested, \\\\nweaponize you and tried to get you involved in that case?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. No, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Good. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure of \\\\nthat.\\\\n    In Butler, Pennsylvania, I read something about a ladder, \\\\nthat he used a ladder to get up on that roof, and that the \\\\nladder was found somewhere a distance away. Is that true?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, we do know that he purchased a ladder. I \\\\nthink, if I recall correctly, it was about a five-foot-tall \\\\ntype of ladder. Importantly, we did not find the ladder at the \\\\nscene. So, it&#x27;s not clear that he used the ladder to get on top \\\\nof the roof.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. So, you don&#x27;t think the ladder--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We&#x27;re still digging into all that, things related \\\\nto the ladder and his access to the roof. He did buy a ladder, \\\\nbut the ladder was not found at the scene.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. The ladder didn&#x27;t have any feet on it?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Any feet?\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. It didn&#x27;t walk off?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Oh, yes, right.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir.\\\\n    There have been a lot of threats against public officials. \\\\nWe&#x27;ve seen Mr. Scalise terribly shot and we saw Gabby Giffords \\\\nshot and other Congress people. Many of us have had death \\\\nthreats, and the FBI is made aware of those to help protect us, \\\\nand I appreciate that greatly.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve also had election officials and poll workers \\\\nthreatened. What is the FBI doing in consultation with other \\\\nlaw enforcement to ensure every eligible voter can safely and \\\\nconfidently cast a ballot this year?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, when it comes to threats to election workers, \\\\nin particular, we participate in the Election Threats Task \\\\nForce that DOJ set up. There have been a number, quite a number \\\\nalready of arrests in convictions under that Task Force.\\\\n    We have got a number of investigations underway that \\\\ninvolve all kinds of threats to election workers, ranging from \\\\nonline threats to--there were even some mailings that included \\\\nfentanyl. So, there&#x27;s been a number of types of threats to \\\\nelection workers. These are, after all, people who are putting \\\\nin their own time for the good of the country to try to help us \\\\nhave a functioning democracy. So, the idea that they would be \\\\ntargeted with violence is just outrageous.\\\\n    We are sharing information with election officials about \\\\nthings to be on the lookout for. We have election crime \\\\ncoordinators in all 50--\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. You&#x27;ll be prepared for Election Day with \\\\nadditional--the FBI will be looking out for the election--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Thank you. Thank you.\\\\n    Jeffrey Epstein has been in the news a lot lately about \\\\ninvolvement with certain people high in politics involved. Did \\\\nthe FBI conduct a raid on his townhouse in New York when he was \\\\nincarcerated in New York? There was a raid on his East side \\\\ntownhouse.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I don&#x27;t know about a raid. I know we \\\\nexecuted a number of searches in the course of our fairly \\\\nextensive investigation related to Mr. Epstein.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Can you tell me if during that search if you \\\\ncame across and have within your possession of the FBI tapes of \\\\nhim with other individuals that he might have taken in, people \\\\nand compromising people--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s anything I can share \\\\nrelated to that. I can see if there&#x27;s information we could \\\\nprovide and maybe get back to you with it.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. If there were tapes of people in prominent \\\\npositions, friends of his he posed for pictures with, possibly \\\\nin compromising positions, it would be--the public I think has \\\\na right to see those.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, how we handle evidence recovered in a \\\\ncriminal investigation has all kinds of rules that apply to it. \\\\nI recognize the intense public interest in the subject, but \\\\nwe&#x27;d have to follow our rules. I&#x27;m happy, like I said, I&#x27;m \\\\nhappy to followup with my team on it.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir.\\\\n    I appreciate your service and thank you for being here \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Will the gentleman yield the last five?\\\\n    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Wray, for being here.\\\\n    How many shots did the shooter fire?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we know that he fired at least eight, \\\\nbecause we recovered eight cartridges on the roof.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. OK. Are all the cartridges and the unspent \\\\nbullets, have they been--do you know how many there are? You&#x27;ve \\\\naccounted for all those? I assume--yes?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We believe we have. We believe we have. Again, \\\\nthere is lots of work still ongoing, but, yes, we believe we \\\\nhave accounted.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Did the recovered shells, the cartridges, match \\\\nthe shooter&#x27;s rifle?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. My recollection is yes.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. You conducted analysis that confirms that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we work with ATF, but, yes. So, some of the \\\\nwork has been divided up, but--\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. How many shells, casings were recovered from the \\\\nlocation of the counter-snipers?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;m sorry? I couldn&#x27;t hear the last part.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. From the counter-snipers&#x27; location?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That, I don&#x27;t have the answer, at least here at \\\\nmy fingertips.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. OK. Did the blood and tissue pattern of the \\\\nshooter, did it match the stories with the witness testimony \\\\nthat you&#x27;ve heard so far?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Can you--well, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m following the \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Well, I assume you&#x27;ve interviewed the counter-\\\\nsnipers, or you have that evidence, and other witnesses \\\\ndescribing the kill of the shooter. I&#x27;m wondering if the blood, \\\\ntissue, and brain matter is consistent with the testimony that \\\\nyou&#x27;re receiving. In other words, does the physical--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. In terms of the manner of death--\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Exactly. Is the physical evidence consistent \\\\nwith where the shot from the counter-snipers took place--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes. So, the autopsy is being handled by, as is \\\\nnot unusual, the State authorities. My understanding is, thus \\\\nfar, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fully complete, which is, again, not \\\\ntotally unusual. So far, nothing remarkable on that front.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. That&#x27;s from the body itself, but from actually \\\\nthe scene where the shooter was found, is everything consistent \\\\nwith the testimony? The physical evidence at the scene, is that \\\\nconsistent with the testimony you&#x27;ve seen, that you&#x27;ve heard so \\\\nfar?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, far, yes. Again, ongoing investigation.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Were you able to determine whether the shooter \\\\ntook the gun up with him when he climbed up to the top of the \\\\nroof? Was it already placed there somewhere?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, that is something that we&#x27;re drilling into \\\\nright now that we don&#x27;t know the answer to yet. I can tell you, \\\\nwhich may be relevant, though, to your question, and I don&#x27;t \\\\nthink this has been reported yet, that the weapon had a \\\\ncollapsible stock, which could explain why it might have been \\\\nless easy for people to observe, you know.\\\\n    Because one of the things that we&#x27;re finding is people have \\\\nobserved him--the first people to observe him with the weapon \\\\nwere when he was already on the roof. We haven&#x27;t yet found \\\\nanybody with firsthand observation of him with the weapon \\\\nwalking around beforehand. So, that doesn&#x27;t mean he wasn&#x27;t, \\\\nobviously, but the collapsible stock is potentially a very \\\\nsignificant feature that might be relevant to that.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Did he have a scope?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I believe so, but I just, as I sit here right \\\\nnow, I don&#x27;t remember.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. OK. You mentioned about two hours before the \\\\nincident that he had a drone, and he was using a drone. Instead \\\\nof me putting words in your mouth, just tell me what, how you \\\\ndiscovered the drone; how you discovered the time, and how you \\\\ndiscovered--if you can describe what he would have been \\\\nobserving with a drone and how you determined that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, this is something that is very much ongoing \\\\nright now. We&#x27;re going back and forth with our lab as they \\\\ncontinue to do work on it.\\\\n    What I would say is, the drone was in his car. As I said, \\\\nwe&#x27;ve been able to, by exploiting the drone, determine its use \\\\nand flight paths. There were no pictures or videos on the drone \\\\nof the day of the rally, for example.\\\\n    We have been able to reverse-engineer the flight path of \\\\nthe drone from the day of the rally, and that&#x27;s how we know \\\\nthat, for about 11 minutes from--I think it&#x27;s around 3:50-4:00 \\\\np.m., somewhere in that range, he was flying the drone, and we \\\\nhave the flight path. It&#x27;s about 200 yards away from where \\\\nformer President Trump would ultimately be speaking.\\\\n    So, that would have primarily given him a vantage point. \\\\nI&#x27;m trying to think of how to describe this. If the former \\\\nPresident&#x27;s podium is that way the drone would be over here--\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. --looking say 200 yards again off this way, \\\\nlooking back. So, it would have shown the shooter, we think--\\\\nagain, we&#x27;re still doing more work on this. I really want to \\\\nqualify what I&#x27;m saying, but I&#x27;m trying to be transparent and \\\\nlean in here.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Right.\\\\n    We think it would have shown him kind of what would have \\\\nbeen behind him--\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. When you say, ``behind him&#x27;&#x27;--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Behind the shooter.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Oh, behind the shooter?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Correct. Like, in other words, almost like giving \\\\nhim a rearview mirror of the scene behind him, except, again, \\\\nhe wasn&#x27;t flying it overhead while he was later back for the \\\\nassassination--\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Sure. He would have had, with the drone, he \\\\nwould have been able to also assess kind of what--because the \\\\nstage, I assume, was already set. He would have been able to \\\\nassess that angle with the rooftop as well, forward and \\\\nbackward, I assume?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, certainly, going toward the podium.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Right. Again, we&#x27;re still trying to figure out \\\\nexactly what he saw. Because we&#x27;re having to, in effect, \\\\nbecause there&#x27;s no recording of what he saw during those 11 \\\\nminutes our hypothesis at this point, the experts think he \\\\nwould have been livestream-ing it.\\\\n    So, we&#x27;re trying to, in effect, say, OK, well, if this was \\\\nthe flight pattern, given these capabilities of the drone, what \\\\nwould you have seen, what could you have seen for those 11 \\\\nminutes? Again, it wasn&#x27;t over the stage or the kind of hub of \\\\nthe rally. It was about 200 yards away, but it looks like it \\\\nwould have been looking at, let&#x27;s say the length of a football \\\\nfield or so, more kind of toward the podium.\\\\n    Mr. Biggs. Right. Great. Thank you, Mr.--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. How many separate times was the shooter on \\\\nthe premises?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, again, with the caveat that we&#x27;re continuing \\\\nto work on it, we believe that the first time he traveled to \\\\nthe grounds was a week before. He spent roughly, 20 minutes \\\\nthere.\\\\n    Then, he went to the grounds again on the morning of the \\\\nevent, it appears, for about 70 minutes but, again, I qualify \\\\nthat. I&#x27;d have to go back and look to be sure of that part.\\\\n    Then, he came back in the afternoon. So, that would be, I \\\\nguess, a third time, for good. That included things like this \\\\ndrone activity we just talked about.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman from California is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Schiff. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Director, thank you for appearing. Thank you for the \\\\nextraordinary job that you&#x27;re doing. Please convey our thanks \\\\nto the men and women at the Bureau for their incredible work. I \\\\nworked with them since I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney more \\\\nthan 30 years ago.\\\\n    Let me start with a threshold question that I&#x27;m curious \\\\nabout. When I applied to be an Assistant U.S. Attorney, I had \\\\nto go through a background check. Do candidates for the FBI \\\\nhave to go through background checks?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Schiff. Would someone with dozens of felony convictions \\\\nsurvive a background check for the Bureau?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. No.\\\\n    Mr. Schiff. So, they would never be hired by the Bureau?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. No.\\\\n    Mr. Schiff. Well, clearly, the Bureau has--you don&#x27;t have \\\\nto comment on this; I know you won&#x27;t but, clearly, the Bureau \\\\nhas higher standards for their hiring than one of America&#x27;s \\\\ngreat political parties.\\\\n    Let me turn to the events of the, the tragic shooting. Have \\\\nyou been able to gain access to the shooter&#x27;s electronic \\\\ncommunications, social media? With the caveats that you \\\\nmentioned that the investigation is still early, have you been \\\\nable to make any deductions or are there any indications of the \\\\nshooter&#x27;s motivation from those electronic holdings?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, in terms of our ability to access it, we have \\\\nbeen able to get into and exploit a number of electronic \\\\ndevices, digital devices, but not all them yet. Then, within \\\\nhis various accounts, we&#x27;ve been able to get access to some of \\\\nthem, but some of them we&#x27;re still waiting on.\\\\n    Some of them, we may never get access to because of the \\\\nencryption issue, that presents an increasingly vexing barrier \\\\nfor law enforcement, not just the FBI, but for law enforcement \\\\nall over the country.\\\\n    We&#x27;re still drilling into that. We have some information. \\\\nSome places we&#x27;ve been able to look. Some places we will be \\\\nable to look. Some places we may never be able to see, no \\\\nmatter how good our legal process is. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking \\\\nat right now.\\\\n    In terms of what we&#x27;ve been able to find so far, a lot of \\\\nthe usual repositories of information have not yielded anything \\\\nnotable in terms of motive or ideology. Having said that, it \\\\ndoes appear fairly clear that he was interested in public \\\\nfigures kind of more broadly and this is important--that, \\\\nstarting somewhere around July 6th or so, he became very \\\\nfocused on former President Trump and this rally.\\\\n    So, one of the things that I can share here today that has \\\\nnot been shared yet is that we&#x27;ve just, in the last couple of \\\\ndays, found that from our review--to your point about devices--\\\\nanalysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter \\\\nreveals that, on July 6th, he did a Google search for, quote, \\\\n``How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?&#x27;&#x27; So, that search, \\\\nobviously, is significant in terms of his state of mind.\\\\n    That is the same day that it appears that he registered for \\\\nthe Butler rally.\\\\n    Mr. Schiff. When you say that his electronic holdings \\\\nindicated an interest in different public figures, without \\\\nrevealing anything you&#x27;re not comfortable revealing about those \\\\npublic figures, can you tell us anything, generally, about \\\\nthem, either the offices they hold, their political party, or \\\\nwas it simply people of a high profile?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, a couple of things. First, the images that \\\\nwe&#x27;ve recovered so far--I can&#x27;t remember which of his various \\\\ndevices--appeared to be what we call cached images from \\\\nsearches of news articles. So, if you do a news article search, \\\\nof course, images, if there are photos on it, those photos get \\\\nstored automatically in your cache, as opposed to me searching \\\\nor him searching for a specific person and getting up images of \\\\nthat person.\\\\n    As far as the pictures that are like that, it doesn&#x27;t seem \\\\nto be a whole lot of rhyme or reason to it so far, other than \\\\nthese are, you know, all prominent public people. They cover \\\\nboth parties. They cover both U.S. people and even some foreign \\\\npublic officials.\\\\n    So, that part doesn&#x27;t appear to--that one repository of \\\\ninformation doesn&#x27;t appear to be overly indicative of motive, \\\\nother than interest in public figures. That could be just \\\\nbecause he was reading news stories.\\\\n    So, we&#x27;re still trying to drill into that. That&#x27;s why all \\\\nthese outstanding legal process returns that we&#x27;re waiting on \\\\nfor various accounts, platforms, et cetera, any one of them \\\\ncould be one that would have very indicative, very important \\\\ninformation.\\\\n    Mr. Schiff. If I could be permitted one very short \\\\nadditional question, Chair?\\\\n    From that, any indication of any other particular target? \\\\nThat is, someone who was not just sort of generically the \\\\nsubject of the searches you described, but for which there was \\\\nmore of an interest than others?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. The information I just described at the moment \\\\ndoes not appear particularly indicative of targeting in its own \\\\nright. Again, that dot, once we get other information, could \\\\nconnect in a way that might be more meaningful.\\\\n    I really--I&#x27;m sharing that piece of information with this \\\\nCommittee and with the American public, but I think it&#x27;s \\\\nimportant that we put down a qualification. This does not \\\\nappear to be some kind of target list, or something like that. \\\\nThis is cached images from running searches of news stories. \\\\nAgain, there&#x27;s nothing at the moment that--there&#x27;s no pattern \\\\nfrom that particular piece of information that is overly \\\\nremarkable so far.\\\\n    Mr. Schiff. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Chair.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from California is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. Mr. Director, you previously told us that \\\\nyou consider the situation on the Southern border to be a \\\\nmassive security threat to our country. Is that still your \\\\nassessment?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I stand by my prior testimony. In fact, just in \\\\nthe last month or so, we&#x27;ve conducted a significant series of \\\\narrests--I say, ``we,&#x27;&#x27; our Joint Terrorism Task Forcing is \\\\nworking with ICE--of a number of individuals with suspected \\\\ninternational terrorism ties.\\\\n    I have also been very vocal about the fact that, since--and \\\\nthis is really since the last time I appeared before you--that \\\\nwe are increasingly concerned about the possibility, not just \\\\nof a foreign terrorist-inspired attack, which is very much, \\\\nvery much a concern, but even the potential for a coordinated \\\\nforeign terrorist attack, perhaps like what we&#x27;ve seen against \\\\nthe concert hall in Russia, for example, but just here in the \\\\nUnited States.\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. Well, the 19 suicide bombers who overstayed \\\\nvisas were responsible for 3,000 American deaths on 9/11. What \\\\nis your best estimate of the number of foreign terrorists who \\\\nare now in our country?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know if I could give you that number. \\\\nWhat I can tell you is we have lots of foreign terrorism-\\\\nrelated investigations. That doesn&#x27;t mean that all of them came \\\\nin illegally or anything like that.\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. It seems to me that the simplest act of \\\\nterrorism would be for dozens of guerillas to attack low \\\\nsecurity, high density venues, for example, Friday night high \\\\nschool football games all across the country at the same hour \\\\nwith bombs and automatic weapons. That would produce thousands \\\\nof casualties from coast to coast in a matter of minutes.\\\\n    How likely is such a scenario?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, what you are describing would require of \\\\ncourse a lot of coordination. What I will tell you, and I think \\\\nyou are onto a particularly important point from my \\\\nperspective, which is that unlike the 9/11 attacks, which, \\\\nagain, I was in FBI headquarters on the day of 9/11, and so I \\\\nremember it vividly, and I spent plenty of time in the period \\\\nafter that in my prior positions engaged with the families and \\\\nthe victims.\\\\n    What we are seeing more and more with the foreign terrorist \\\\nthreat, and frankly, also the domestic terrorism threat, is a \\\\nfocus on what you are talking about, what I would call soft \\\\ntargets. Which is really, for the American people&#x27;s benefit, \\\\njust intelligence community speak for where everyday people \\\\nlive their everyday lives.\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. What terrorist groups have now infiltrated \\\\nour country that you are tracking?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I don&#x27;t know that I would say infiltrated. \\\\nWe have investigations, as we speak, that relate to ISIS and \\\\nits affiliates. We have investigations, as we speak, that \\\\nrelate to Al Qaeda. We have investigations, as we speak, that \\\\nrelate to Al Shabaab. We have investigations as we speak that \\\\nrelate to the Iranian proxies, Hezbollah, and frankly even the \\\\nIRGC Quds Force itself.\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. What foreign criminal gangs are now in our \\\\ncountry that you are most concerned with?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, foreign criminal gangs, we obviously have \\\\ninvestigations, a lot of investigations into gangs like MS-13, \\\\nfor example, and some of its counterparts. Although, I think if \\\\nyou were to talk to most chiefs and sheriffs like I am doing \\\\nevery week, we shouldn&#x27;t underestimate how prevalent \\\\nneighborhood gangs are really. It is a lot of the gang violence \\\\nthat--\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. Well, I am concerned about those that we \\\\nhave allowed in through the Southern border and what threat \\\\nthey are now posing. Do you believe that the vetting performed \\\\nat the Southwest border is adequate to ensure that aliens with \\\\nterrorist or criminal gang ties are not being released into the \\\\nUnited States?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, it is not really for me to speak to the \\\\nvetting. What I would tell you is that--\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. You have to deal with it once they are \\\\nreleased into the United States.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. One of the concerns that I have, which I touched \\\\non briefly in my opening, is there has been a lot of focus on \\\\nthe number of known or suspected terrorists encountered at the \\\\nborder. That number has increased over the last five or six \\\\nyears, and that should be of concern.\\\\n    Frankly, to me, the bigger concern is individuals who \\\\neither weren&#x27;t on the watch list at the time they came in \\\\nbecause there wasn&#x27;t information known yet that ties them to \\\\nterrorism, and it is only after they get in that some new piece \\\\nof information develops somewhere overseas and now we know. \\\\nThat is a bigger concern.\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. We have been warned that they basically vet \\\\nagainst a blank sheet of paper. If they don&#x27;t have a record in \\\\nthis country, Border Patrol probably doesn&#x27;t have any record. \\\\nThey are released into the country, and you find out later \\\\nabout the dangers.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. If they use fake documents and there aren&#x27;t \\\\nbiometrics to connect them. I think sometimes there are people \\\\nwho come in who, because of the nature of the threat \\\\ninformation that puts somebody on the watch list, there weren&#x27;t \\\\nfingerprints from the person at the time. Because not every \\\\npiece of intelligence comes with fingerprints.\\\\n    So, then the guy comes in using a fake ID--\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. Of course--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. There is no reason to connect them.\\\\n    Mr. McClintock. Of course, the two million got-aways you \\\\nknow absolutely nothing about.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Exactly. Well, I don&#x27;t know about absolutely \\\\nnothing, because we may come across them in other things. One \\\\nof the key parts of our collective defense here is that we work \\\\nwith 800,000 sworn law enforcement across the country, and we \\\\ntrain them on the right questions to ask and things like that \\\\nso that we can build in additional eyes and ears.\\\\n    If they do a traffic stop or whatever it happens to be, we \\\\nrun a greater chance of leveraging all that to pick up people \\\\nwho may have slipped through the cracks.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \\\\nCalifornia is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Director, we are about 100 days until the \\\\nelection. Russia has attacked our democracy in past elections. \\\\nAre they seeking to do it in this one?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We assess that the Russian Government continues \\\\nto want to influence and in various ways interfere with our \\\\ndemocracy, with our electoral process.\\\\n    In fact, just in the last few weeks, we announced a \\\\nsignificant disruption of a generative AI-enhanced social media \\\\nbot farm essentially of the Russians that was designed to be an \\\\ninfluence operation and some of the fake, fictitious profiles \\\\nof those bots purported to be U.S. persons.\\\\n    So, they are still at it. We have seen that in election \\\\ncycle after election cycle.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Do the Russians have a preferred candidate?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not sure that I could speak to that here. \\\\nCertainly, what I would tell you is it is not just the \\\\nRussians. I think that is important for people to know too.\\\\n    There is a lot of attention to the Russians, as there \\\\nshould be. We also know, you may recall, that in 2020, Director \\\\nRatcliffe and I announced an effort by the Iranians to try to \\\\ninterfere.\\\\n    More recently, we have had indictments related to China. \\\\nThirty-four Chinese MPS officers creating fictitious personas, \\\\nposting false information online, full of narratives designed \\\\nto sow device and discord, undermine us. I am talking about \\\\nnarratives that they were pushing.\\\\n    Again, purporting to be Americans but actually Chinese MPS \\\\nofficers. For example, trashing any suggestion that COVID came \\\\nfrom a lab leak or trashing U.S. law enforcement on the \\\\noccasion of the anniversary of George Floyd&#x27;s death.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Shifting to the attempted assassination on \\\\nthe former President, I want to make it clear, in America, \\\\nviolence has never been the answer. Not on a certain in January \\\\nor a recent day in July.\\\\n    I just want to go through the shooting just briefly with \\\\nyou. How many armed officers were within the perimeter, just \\\\nballpark figure?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That really goes to the security posture, which \\\\nis the subject of the DHS Inspector General&#x27;s review and the \\\\noutside panel, independent panel that is--\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Would you say probably more than 100, though?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I have to believe that number, but I don&#x27;t, \\\\nagain, I don&#x27;t have that number at my fingertips. Our focus is \\\\non the shooter and his attack.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. The shooter was able to get eight shots off \\\\nbefore he was killed.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That is what it would appear, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Type of weapon used by the shooter was an \\\\nassault rifle?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Was an AR-style rifle.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. So, that means one trigger pull, one round, \\\\nis that right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Essentially.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Do you like to shoot?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Do I?\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Do you know the difference between an AR and \\\\nbolt action rifle?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not going to try to sit here and engage on \\\\nfirearms expertise, but I have fired a variety of weapons.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Had the shooter used a bolt-action rifle, \\\\nwould that have been one trigger pull, one round?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That is my understanding.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. Would there have been more--well, on an \\\\nassault rifle, trigger pull, round, trigger pull, and round. \\\\nBolt action, nonassault rifle, what is the difference? Is it \\\\nfaster, slower?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. He was able to get more rounds off more quickly \\\\nthan he would have with other kinds of weapons.\\\\n    Mr. Swalwell. That is my point, is that we can add \\\\nadditional resources to protect both candidates, and we should. \\\\nThe people who went to that rally deserved to be protected from \\\\ngun violence, just like the students at Parkland deserved to be \\\\nprotected from gun violence. Just the like the babies at Sandy \\\\nHook deserved to be protected from gun violence.\\\\n    So, we will devote more resources. We have added a \\\\nPresidential Candidate who is also now protected. If we are \\\\nbeing honest with ourselves, we have armed this country to the \\\\nteeth. We have allowed the most dangerous people to have access \\\\nto the most dangerous weapons.\\\\n    I say that as a parent of a seven-, five-, and a two-year-\\\\nold, the two oldest who have done multiple mass shooter drills \\\\nin their classrooms. I say that as a brother to two police \\\\nofficers who walk a very violent beat. I say that as an elected \\\\nofficial who believes that my colleagues deserve to be as safe \\\\nas I deserve to be when we are at political rallies.\\\\n    So, we really need to step back and think if we allow these \\\\nweapons to be in our country, can we truly protect our elected \\\\nofficials? Can we truly protect, most importantly, our children \\\\nand the next generation?\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. It is good to have \\\\nMr. Massie back with us today. Some of us had a chance to go to \\\\nKentucky over the last few weeks and visit Thomas and his \\\\nfamily and hear all kinds of wonderful stories about Rhonda. \\\\nAmazing, amazing lady, a gentle spirit. We are glad to have Mr. \\\\nMassie back with us.\\\\n    The next five minutes belong to you, Congressman.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. Thank you, Chair.\\\\n    Director Wray, how many counter-snipers were present at the \\\\nrally that day, and which of the counter-snipers took the shot \\\\nthat took out the would-be assassin?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t have the number of counter-snipers. I \\\\nknow it was a Secret Service counter-sniper who took the shot \\\\nthat eliminated the shooter. We have conducted a number of \\\\ninterviews, including with him.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. So, was it one of the two that we see in the \\\\nvideos on top of the roof, or was it a different location that \\\\nwas faster?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am afraid I don&#x27;t have that at my fingertips \\\\nhere.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. OK. You mentioned that the would-be assassin \\\\nbought a five-foot ladder. You have a credit card evidence of \\\\nthat. It looks like on the scene there was a larger ladder that \\\\nhe might have used.\\\\n    Do you know which ladder he used to get to the roof, and do \\\\nyou have possession of that five-foot ladder and the other \\\\nladder? Do you know how the taller ladder got to the scene?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, this whole business about the ladder is \\\\nsomething we are drilling into more. We do have possession of \\\\nthe five-foot ladder that he purchased close in time to his \\\\nattempted assassination, that we traced the purchase of that \\\\nladder from a receipt, a bloodied receipt that he had on him at \\\\nthe time that his body was recovered on the roof.\\\\n    We do not yet know for sure how exactly he got up on the \\\\nroof. We are looking at various forensic pieces to try to kind \\\\nof piece that together. So, more to come on that.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. Do you know where the five-foot ladder was \\\\nfound or retrieved? Was it near the roof or was it still in his \\\\nvehicle?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Neither. I don&#x27;t have it in front of me, but I \\\\nknow that it was not on scene, and I know that it was not in \\\\nhis vehicle. We can circle back to you and give you that.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. OK. Is there any evidence at all that he may \\\\nhave been in contact with somebody else before this occurred \\\\nthat may have had any prior knowledge or may have helped him \\\\nplan this event?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, needless to say that is the question that \\\\nwe are intensely focused on, because that would obviously be \\\\nincredibly meaningful. So far, underlined, so far, we have not \\\\nfound any evidence of any accomplices or co-conspirators, \\\\nforeign or domestic.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. You are using geolocation data to see if his \\\\ncellphone was near another cellphone, I presume?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Right. We are doing lots of different kinds of \\\\ncellular analysis, geolocation stuff, looking at his accounts. \\\\nHe, from everything we have seen, which is consistent with what \\\\nwe have learned in interviews, a lot of people describe him as \\\\na loner.\\\\n    That does fit with what we are seeing in his devices. His \\\\nlist of contacts, for example, is very short compared to what \\\\nyou would normally see for most people. So, it doesn&#x27;t appear \\\\nto be a whole lot of interaction between him face to face or \\\\ndigital, with a lot of people.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. OK, thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That doesn&#x27;t mean there is not any, and that is \\\\nwhy we are drilling into--we are trying to talk to anybody who \\\\nhas had any engagement with him whatsoever, digital, in-person, \\\\nclassmates, coworkers, etc.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. Right, appreciate that. Now, I want to talk \\\\nabout another possible assassination attempt. I will start by \\\\nsharing a video of President Biden, and this is from recently. \\\\nThis is in the last month. So, if we can play that.\\\\n    [Video shown.]\\\\n    Mr. Massie. OK, and he is referring to January 6th. Were \\\\nthere gallows erected to hang Mike Pence, as the President says \\\\nhere?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not aware of any physical gallows. I can&#x27;t \\\\nremember whether from a demonstration perspective there may not \\\\nhave been some kind of replica or--\\\\n    Mr. Massie. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Symbol of something like that.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. That is my impression.\\\\n    Can you raise that up so he can see it?\\\\n    It looks like there was some kind of prop that was built. \\\\nThe construction doesn&#x27;t look like it lends itself to actually \\\\nhanging somebody. It is more of a prop, as you suggested, that \\\\nwas erected on January 6th.\\\\n    If the President were correct that these gallows were \\\\nerected to hang Mike Pence, that would be a very serious \\\\nallegation, wouldn&#x27;t it?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I would take it very seriously, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. Has anybody been arrested, or do you have any \\\\nleads in conjunction with the erection of these gallows? We had \\\\na picture here on the screen, if you can show it again. It was \\\\njust up there, there is an individual here who is seen on, near \\\\nthese gallows. Has he been arrested? Have you identified this \\\\nperson?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know that I can speak to this specific \\\\nperson or the gallows that are pictured on the image. We have \\\\nhad I think 850 people who have pled guilty to Federal crimes \\\\nrelated to January 6th, and another 180 I think is convicted at \\\\ntrials. So, I just can&#x27;t be sure.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. Some of them merely for going into the capitol. \\\\nHere, the President suggests that individual intended to hang \\\\nVice President Pence, which seems like kind of a wild claim, \\\\nmyself, given the construction of those gallows.\\\\n    If we are to take him seriously, or even if we aren&#x27;t, let \\\\nme just finish by saying this: If you have no leads or you are \\\\nnot sure if anybody who erected those gallows was arrested or \\\\nis being investigated, were there any confidential human \\\\nsources involved from the FBI or any other agency in the \\\\nerection of that prop, those gallows?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not aware of anything like that.\\\\n    Mr. Massie. All right. Thank you, I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentlelady \\\\nfrom Washington is recognized.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Welcome, Director Wray.\\\\n    Political violence of any kind is dangerous, unlawful, and \\\\ntotally unacceptable. Just as we all watched and then \\\\nunequivocally condemned the attempted assassination attempt on \\\\nour former President, I wish that we could all come together to \\\\nunequivocally condemn the act of political violence on January \\\\n6th, instead of defending props that were used that were \\\\nharmful, dangerous props of gallows attempting to show what \\\\npeople wanted to do to Vice President Pence.\\\\n    Extremists attempted to subvert our democracy in the worst \\\\nassault on the U.S. Capitol since the War of 1812. Many of us \\\\nwere trapped in the gallery that day. We feared we would not \\\\nmake it out. Insurrectionists were chasing down former Speaker \\\\nNancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence.\\\\n    I, myself, have been the direct target of political \\\\nviolence when an armed man with a gun showed up at my door, \\\\nthreatened me and my family. We actually ended up having to \\\\nmove our home.\\\\n    So, I understand the increased tenor of political violence \\\\nthat is wracking our country. It has been on the rise, fomented \\\\nby violent and dehumanizing rhetoric from top public officials, \\\\nincluding the former President and Members of Congress, sadly. \\\\nBolstered by the proliferation of easily accessible guns, \\\\nincluding assault-style weapons.\\\\n    All this violence is unacceptable, and I wholeheartedly \\\\ncondemn it. I just hope we condemn all the violence, not just \\\\none or two incidents.\\\\n    Mr. Wray, today I want to focus on the role of the FBI and \\\\nthe need for the Bureau to remain politically neutral and \\\\nindependent. The FBI cannot and should not be subject to the \\\\nwhims of any President. The majority apparently doesn&#x27;t think \\\\nthat the FBI needs to be politically neutral and independent.\\\\n    They want an FBI subordinate to the President, not \\\\naccountable to the American people. That is one part of a \\\\nlarger plan to undermine our democracy, to remove the checks \\\\nand balances that have protected us, and ultimately to subvert \\\\nour freedoms.\\\\n    That agenda, promulgated by the former President, his \\\\nloyalists, and their MAGA allies, is called Project 2025. It is \\\\npublicly available online. I encourage everyone who is watching \\\\nthis to Google it. It includes plans to undermine every part of \\\\nour government, including the FBI.\\\\n    Trump&#x27;s Project 2025 agenda says that the Director of the \\\\nFBI must not be independent of politics, but instead must do \\\\nwhatever the President orders. Under Trump&#x27;s Project 2025, \\\\nTrump loyalists would undermine the nonpolitical and \\\\nindependent structure of the FBI.\\\\n    Project 2025 openly calls on the next conservative \\\\nadministration to support, ``a vast expansion of the number of \\\\npolitical appointees in every office across the DOJ, especially \\\\nthe FBI.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    So, Mr. Wray, given your extensive experience as a law \\\\nenforcement professional at DOJ across multiple Republican and \\\\nDemocratic Administrations, why do you think it is important \\\\nthat the FBI maintain political independence from the \\\\nPresident?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I think the FBI is and needs to stay independent. \\\\nThat means protecting the American people without fear or \\\\nfavor, upholding the Constitution and the rule of law. It means \\\\nfollowing the facts wherever they lead, no matter who likes it.\\\\n    I add that last part because the essence of independence \\\\nand objectivity is not that an investigation is going to always \\\\nyield the result you want. Our independence and objectivity \\\\ncan&#x27;t only be respected when you like the outcome. That is the \\\\nvery essence of objectivity. Sometimes you are going to like \\\\nthe result, sometimes you are not going to like the result.\\\\n    That applies to everyone, including us. A number of times, \\\\nwe are disappointed and frustrated by the results of our \\\\ninvestigations. The alternative is an erosion of the rule of \\\\nlaw, where the only thing that distinguishes one investigation \\\\nfrom another is power.\\\\n    That is what you see in some authoritarian countries around \\\\nthe world. So, I am not familiar with this particular--\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. No, I didn&#x27;t ask you to comment on that.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Project 2025 thing--\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. No, I just wanted to know--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know anything about it. What I can tell \\\\nyou is, from my perspective, the FBI needs to be functioning as \\\\nindependent.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. It doesn&#x27;t mean it is not part of the executive \\\\nbranch, it doesn&#x27;t mean the FBI Director doesn&#x27;t serve at the \\\\npleasure of the President. It does mean that the way we do our \\\\nwork--\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. Has to be objective.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Has to be independent.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. Yes, thank you. I have another question about \\\\nthe role of attorneys at the FBI Office of General Counsel. How \\\\ndo we protect that work?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am sorry, could you repeat the question?\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. The role, what role do the attorneys at the \\\\nFBI Office of General Counsel play in ensuring that the Bureau \\\\nrespects the Constitutional rights of American citizens? How do \\\\nwe protect that work?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, in my experience, the lawyers in the Office \\\\nof the General Counsel play an incredibly important role in \\\\nensuring that our agents have their questions about how to \\\\ncomply with the law and conducting their work answered and \\\\nensuring that we conduct our work in the right way, which means \\\\nscrupulously adhering to the laws and the rules that apply to \\\\nus.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. I just wanted to say, before I yield, Mr. \\\\nChair, that the Project 2025 also eliminates the FBI&#x27;s Office \\\\nof General Counsel in-house lawyers, who are responsible for \\\\nthat role. I appreciate your indulgence, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentlelady yields back. The gentleman \\\\nfrom Wisconsin is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    I think it was when you were here in December of last year, \\\\nMr. Wray, that you said blinking lights were going off in \\\\nregard to the Southern border and what is happening down there. \\\\nHas the border situation improved in terms of your assessment \\\\nwith the security of Americans since you were last here in \\\\nDecember?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I guess a couple things. I appreciate the \\\\nquestion. So, first, the blinking lights comment that I made \\\\nrefers more broadly to the threat environment that I am seeing \\\\nas FBI Director across a wide range of threats. Contributing to \\\\nthat in a variety of ways are the threats that emanate from the \\\\nborder.\\\\n    So, it is not a comment just on the border issues, it is \\\\nthe threat environment that we face more broadly and my \\\\nexperience in law enforcement.\\\\n    I am increasingly concerned that foreign terrorists could \\\\nseek to exploit vulnerabilities at our Southwest border or at \\\\nother ports of entry, or in other aspects of our immigration \\\\nsystem, to facilitate an attack here in the United States. I \\\\nthink that is something we have to be concerned about.\\\\n    There has been a lot of focus on numbers, numbers of this, \\\\nnumbers of that. I understand that. As I think was referenced \\\\nin an earlier question, it doesn&#x27;t take very many foreign \\\\nterrorists to be a real problem.\\\\n    We had 19 highjackers responsible for the 9/11 attacks. We \\\\njust not that long ago had a case, as some of the Members of \\\\nthe Committee will remember, where we charged an individual for \\\\ntrying to smuggle individuals in to assassinate former \\\\nPresident Bush.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Are you concerned that the Border Patrol \\\\nChief, former Border Control Chief Rodney Scott said that \\\\nconcerned about very, very minuscule data that they are \\\\nreceiving.\\\\n    So, there is all this--we are told that illegal aliens are \\\\nvetted against databases. Oftentimes, they are doing biometrics \\\\nas they come into this country but not looking behind it in \\\\ntheir home countries. Does that concern you when there is not a \\\\nreview done in the home country?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we certainly need as much help as we can \\\\nget from the countries of origin. These people, when I say \\\\norigin, not just where they come from originally, but countries \\\\nthey have come through. The biometric enrollment piece is of \\\\ncourse an important one. We have situations where even if--\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Are we doing a thorough enough job of \\\\nreviewing them, their actions and their lives in their home \\\\ncountries before they came here?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we need more help from our foreign \\\\npartners. There is no question about that. I think that is an \\\\nimportant part--\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. How about our domestic partners like the CIA \\\\nand others that are supposed to protect us?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, there has been a lot of discussion, of \\\\ncourse, over the last several years about the pivot to what is \\\\ncalled the hard targets, right, the understandable focus, which \\\\nI support, of focusing on the threat posed by China, Russia, \\\\nand Iran.\\\\n    With that comes, if you look at, for example, the \\\\nwithdrawal from Afghanistan, we start to lose sources of \\\\ninformation about foreign terrorist threats from overseas. That \\\\nis a concern to me.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. My time is running out. Has Vice-President \\\\nHarris met with you in regard to the border?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I have been in meetings with, that have \\\\nincluded the Vice President that in different ways touched on \\\\nborder issues.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Has she specifically asked you for a meeting \\\\nin regard to the threat that is at the border?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not going to get into sort of specific \\\\nmeetings, but I can tell you that I have been in meetings that \\\\nhave included, among other people, the Vice President, that \\\\ntouch on border security issues.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Did she ask questions about what you thought \\\\nneeded to be done in regard to reducing this threat to the \\\\nAmerican people?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I really can&#x27;t get into specific conversations.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Is support for President Trump a security \\\\nconcern within the FBI?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am sorry, I couldn&#x27;t hear.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Is support for President Trump a security \\\\nconcern among your employees?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. No.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Is objection to the COVID-19 vaccine a \\\\nsecurity threat?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Not from my perspective.\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Who approved what is termed the ``Trump \\\\nquestionnaire&#x27;&#x27; within the FBI that done by SIIS? Dena Perkins \\\\nand Jeffrey Veltri were behind it. Who was responsible for \\\\nthat, and did you know that there was a Trump questionnaire out \\\\nthere?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, the document you are asking about is an \\\\ninterview outline that we only recently learned about, and in \\\\nmy view is completely inappropriate. I asked my team to get to \\\\nthe bottom of what happened and to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t \\\\nhappen again.\\\\n    I have learned that it is not an FBI form. That its use was \\\\nisolated. That it was created not by an FBI employee, but by an \\\\noutside contractor, and that individual is no longer affiliated \\\\nwith the FBI. We are sending what we have found to the Office \\\\nof Inspector General to, and we will cooperate, of course, with \\\\nanything they--\\\\n    Mr. Tiffany. Mr. Chair, I will just close with this: We \\\\nkeep hearing about these isolated examples, whether it is \\\\nRichmond Catholics, this instance. When isn&#x27;t it a pattern? I \\\\nyield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Correa.\\\\n    Mr. Correa. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Director Wray, welcome again to this Committee, and I want \\\\nto thank you and your agents for the good job you are doing to \\\\nprotect Americans.\\\\n    Earlier this week, I was part of the group that went out to \\\\nvisit Butler, Pennsylvania, Homeland Security members. I agree \\\\nwith my colleagues that have said violence has no part in our \\\\ndemocracy. I trust you will investigate the events surrounding \\\\nJuly 13th thoroughly.\\\\n    I am going to ask you a question, I hope you will keep it \\\\nin mind as your investigation proceeds, which is who is in \\\\ncharge? Who is in charge of a campaign rally, setting it up? \\\\nSecret Service or a campaign?\\\\n    I ask this question because when I was there, I had a \\\\ncouple of law enforcement individuals alluding to that question \\\\nas well. They gave me an example.\\\\n    They said if a Secret Service says you need to set up a \\\\nline of dump trucks behind the stage to serve to protect the \\\\ncandidate, and the campaign says that is bad optics, who ends \\\\nup winning the debate? So, my question is who is in charge?\\\\n    As you investigate this crime scene, I hope you ask the \\\\nlocally elected officials. I spoke to a county supervisor, \\\\nlocal police and sheriff. They all had information they wanted \\\\nus to know, to relay. We just didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to \\\\nsit down and talk to them.\\\\n    There was a lot of concern that they weren&#x27;t given enough \\\\ntime to prepare for this rally. They thought there were things \\\\nthat could have been done better. Ultimately, what I keep \\\\nthinking, what I keep coming back to is the question who is in \\\\ncharge at these rallies.\\\\n    I think it is an important one because we have an election \\\\nright around the corner. Pennsylvania, Butler, these areas, \\\\nbattleground States around the country will continue to be \\\\nareas where our candidates, both sides, will show up, and the \\\\nthreats will continue to be there.\\\\n    So, I hope, Director Wray, that you will keep that \\\\nstatement in mind as you continue to investigate this crime \\\\nscene.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I appreciate the question. I will tell you \\\\nthat we have conducted well over 400 interviews, but we have \\\\nmany more still to conduct. As is not unusual in an \\\\ninvestigation, I am sure there will be situations where we have \\\\nto go back to people we have already interviewed with followup \\\\nquestions, and our interviews cover a wide range of people.\\\\n    I do think it is important to make sure that the Committee \\\\nand the American people understand the scope of our \\\\ninvestigation versus the scope of others. Our investigation is \\\\nfocused on the shooter and his attack.\\\\n    There is, of course, and I understand completely why there \\\\nare two separate reviews, one by the DHS Inspector General, and \\\\nthe other by this outside independent panel that has been \\\\nannounced that are focused on the security posture, the \\\\nadequacy of the security posture at the rally, Secret Service \\\\ndecisionmaking and actions, and things like that.\\\\n    So, I certainly understand why there are all those \\\\nquestions. Those are in scope of those two other reviews and of \\\\ncourse whatever Congress chooses to do. Our investigation, \\\\nthough, because of our interviews with people who were on the \\\\nscene, will relate to that in some ways. We are going to share \\\\nwhatever we learn that is relevant with those other reviews.\\\\n    Mr. Correa. Director Wray, in my last minute that I have I \\\\nam going to flip quickly to your good job resources. Earlier \\\\nthis year in the Appropriations Committee, you testified that \\\\nyou were, for 2024, your budget was 500 million below what you \\\\nneeded to sustain your 2023 efforts.\\\\n    A few minutes ago, you talked about foreign terrorists. The \\\\nlast few weeks I know information has emerged. That information \\\\ncame from FISA information that was able to be collected \\\\noverseas on these possible terrorist threats.\\\\n    What we have here, today, is a domestic terrorist. What \\\\nlooks to be a lone wolf. Your statements, there is nothing \\\\nreally there that would have tipped anybody off to this \\\\nindividual. Is that what I am hearing from you?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I don&#x27;t know that I would go quite that far \\\\nbecause we are still investigating a lot related to the \\\\nshooter. It does appear so far that we are seeing less in his--\\\\n    Mr. Correa. In my six seconds I would just say, I would ask \\\\nthat you let us know what resources you need to protect the \\\\nAmerican public and our candidates and our democratic system.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I appreciate the question. I would just say this: \\\\nWe are in, as I have said consistently today and for quite some \\\\ntime now, we are in an elevated threat environment covering a \\\\nwide range of threats. The FBI is central to protecting the \\\\nAmerican people from those threats.\\\\n    State and local law enforcement, who depend on us everyday, \\\\nrely on us for all sorts of services, databases, forensic \\\\nsupport, and training. I could go on and on and on. A lot of \\\\nthose departments, unlike the FBI, have had a hard time \\\\nrecruiting.\\\\n    So, this is not a time to pull back on our funding, because \\\\nwe are going to leave our brothers and sisters in State and \\\\nlocal law enforcement twisting in the wind, and then by \\\\nextension, the American people we are all collectively sworn to \\\\nprotect.\\\\n    Mr. Correa. Thank you, and Mr. Chair, I yield.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \\\\nTexas is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. Thank you, Chair.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Wray, for being here. When did you last \\\\nspeak with President Biden?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t have the exact date, but it has been \\\\ncertainly since the shooting.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. So, you have spoken to the President since the \\\\nassassination attempt on President Trump&#x27;s life?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. What was the mental State of the President?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We had a perfectly professional conversation.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. Are you--do you have any scheduled briefings with \\\\nthe President upcoming?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Not at the moment specifically scheduled, no.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. In 2016 and 2015, top FBI officials infamously \\\\ntexted about ``their insurance policy to make sure Trump was \\\\nnever elected or inaugurated as President.&#x27;&#x27; Have any FBI \\\\nagents texted, emailed, or expressed disappointment that Trump \\\\nsurvived the assassination attempt or otherwise editorialized \\\\nabout the assassination attempt?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know about any agents. There have been at \\\\nleast two instances I think, or one instance, of an individual \\\\nwho posted something that I consider outrageous, totally \\\\ninappropriate, and unacceptable.\\\\n    That individual has been referred to our Inspection \\\\nDivision, which is the arm, our sort of Internal Affairs \\\\ninvestigatory arm that does the disciplinary process.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. OK. Will you report back to this Committee any \\\\nother incidents?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I will do my best to share information with the \\\\nCommittee.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. You testified earlier that the FBI maintains high \\\\nstandards irrespective of so-called diversity efforts. Is it \\\\ntrue that in December 2016, former Director Comey lowered the \\\\npassing standards for Phase 1, allowing an influx of previously \\\\nunqualified applicants to continue in the hiring process who \\\\nnormally would have been stopped back in December 2016?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, I can&#x27;t speak to Director Comey&#x27;s--\\\\n    Mr. Roy. What were the standards?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I can tell you that at least since I have been \\\\nDirector, changes that we have made to--\\\\n    Mr. Roy. Specific question, were standards changed, Phase \\\\n1, this specific part of the process, were they changed in \\\\n2016?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I don&#x27;t recall if they were changed in \\\\n2016. Obviously, I started, as your question presupposes, after \\\\nthat. What I can tell you is since that time, we have made \\\\nchanges to various phases of the process, but none of them, \\\\nthis is important, none of them lowered the standards. In fact, \\\\nif anything, they actually increased--\\\\n    Mr. Roy. Are you familiar with the reporting that we have, \\\\nand we have asked questions to you about this, I am not sure \\\\nthe result of the questions, that to more ``easily accommodate \\\\na large pool of available applicants the FBI&#x27;s special agent \\\\nhiring standards have been relaxed and requirements measurably \\\\nlowered,&#x27;&#x27; this according to a group of former agents who have \\\\ntestified about this and written a report and submitted it to \\\\nCongress.\\\\n    In addition, specifically, minority, people with 20-year \\\\ncareers, one in particular, a minority who served for more than \\\\n20 years, wrote in this report and submitted it to Congress, \\\\nsaying these standards were, in fact, lowered. That, in fact, \\\\nif you were hiring, you were moved off of hiring if you put \\\\nquality above these kinds of DEI requirements.\\\\n    Do you reject this report, and do you have comments on this \\\\nreport?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I haven&#x27;t read--\\\\n    Mr. Roy. You are aware of the report.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am aware of the report. I don&#x27;t know that I \\\\nhave read every detail of it, but I can tell you that the claim \\\\nthat we have lowered our standards to be less selective and \\\\nless competitive is not accurate.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. So, do you believe these former agents are lying \\\\nto Congress when they submit a report to Congress stipulating \\\\nand suggesting otherwise? Are you saying that they are lying?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am saying they are mistaken.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. OK, but they are affirmatively on the record, they \\\\nare telling us and submitting a report to Congress saying that \\\\nthose facts are directly contradicting what you are testifying \\\\nhere today. So, I just want to be clear, so we know. We are \\\\nsaying that they are submitting evidence to our record to the \\\\ncontrary that you say is untruthful.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I encounter all the time when I travel around the \\\\ncountry and have conversations with our agents, and one of the \\\\nthings I try to do is have meetings with some of the longer \\\\nserving agents, without executive--\\\\n    Mr. Roy. That is OK, my only question is--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. My point, here is--\\\\n    Mr. Roy. The implication is it is untruthful. So, I mean we \\\\nhave only got one minute left. Are you familiar with the case \\\\nof Paulette Harlow? She is a 75-year-old elderly woman from \\\\nMassachusetts with a debilitating medical condition.\\\\n    She was prosecuted for violating the FACE Act and sentenced \\\\nto two years in prison. She has to go to Texas in two weeks. \\\\nShe was praying at an abortion clinic in Washington, DC. The \\\\nFBI interrogated and investigated her.\\\\n    Do you think it is appropriate for a 75-year-old woman who \\\\nwas praying at a clinic in D.C., to be put in prison for two \\\\nyears for that activity? Just a simple question, do you think \\\\nthat is appropriate?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not familiar with the specific case.\\\\n    Mr. Roy. You are not familiar with that case? It has been \\\\nsignificantly in the headlines. So, you don&#x27;t know how to \\\\ncomment on that case. It is appropriate for a 75-year-old woman \\\\nto be put in prison for two years for praying at a clinic.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again, I am not--since I am not familiar with the \\\\ncase, I don&#x27;t want to start weighing in, because I don&#x27;t know \\\\nall the facts.\\\\n    What I can tell you is that when it comes to FACE Act \\\\nenforcement and abortion-related violent extremism, I think one \\\\nof the things that gets lost, and I appreciate the opportunity \\\\nto clarify it, is that really since the Dobbs decision, \\\\nactually more of our abortion-related violent extremism \\\\ninvestigations have focused on violence against pro-life \\\\nfacilities as opposed to the other way around.\\\\n    We have had a number of investigations. We are using FACE \\\\nAct resources and our JTTFs--\\\\n    Mr. Roy. We are still waiting for responses on letters that \\\\nwe have sent indicating the data to the contrary, that there \\\\nhas been significant amount of efforts and targeting of people \\\\nwho are pro-lifers who go to clinics and that they have been \\\\nprosecuted. Like this case, a 75-year-old woman who is now \\\\ngoing to jail in Texas for two years because she was praying at \\\\na clinic in Washington, DC.\\\\n    We have submitted questions on that, and I would appreciate \\\\na response on it. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentlelady \\\\nfrom Pennsylvania is recognized.\\\\n    Ms. Scanlon. Thank you so much.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Wray, for being here and for the work \\\\nthat your team does, as well as for sharing the information \\\\nthat you have been able to today.\\\\n    You just got a couple questions about, that seemed to imply \\\\nthat there was some problem with the FBI&#x27;s diversity efforts. \\\\nCertainly, the 1950&#x27;s version of the FBI was singularly \\\\nCaucasian male agents, etc. Is the FBI a better force for \\\\nhaving a diverse range of employees and agents?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I think diversity makes us better, but like \\\\neverything else, it has to be done the right way. I think we \\\\ncan have a more diverse workforce and do it without lowering \\\\nour standards. That is, in my view, what we have done.\\\\n    Ms. Scanlon. You haven&#x27;t lowered standards at the FBI.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We have not. I repeatedly come across people who \\\\nare confused about different parts of that, and I appreciate \\\\nthe opportunity to set that straight.\\\\n    Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. Yes, I think we are all concerned \\\\nhere as we have seen the rollout of this Project 2025 that \\\\npurports to try to eliminate any reference to diversity efforts \\\\nacross the entire Federal Government. So, it is sort of a top-\\\\nof-mind concern as it is threatening to become reality.\\\\n    So, what I did want to talk about today is something some \\\\nof my colleagues have mentioned, which is the normalization of \\\\nthreats and violence against public servants at all levels, \\\\nwhether it is election workers or school officials, elected \\\\nofficials and their families, judges, Federal law enforcement \\\\nagents, others.\\\\n    To be clear, I think it is very clear that the majority of \\\\nAmericans wholeheartedly condemn any sort of political violence \\\\nand understand that it is not legitimate discourse and that it \\\\nhas no place in our civic life.\\\\n    Words do matter, and they have consequences, particularly \\\\nwhen uttered by people in positions of leadership. So, that is \\\\nwhy I remain very concerned by the willingness of some Members \\\\nof Congress to repeat disinformation and conspiracy theories \\\\nthat undermine trust in our public institutions, which serve \\\\nall Americans.\\\\n    When elected officials embrace overheated or fact-free \\\\nrhetoric, it becomes dangerous. I have been heartened as many \\\\nnational leaders have unequivocally condemned calls to \\\\nviolence, and I would urge all Members of this body to do so \\\\nand continue to do so, regardless of the party affiliation of \\\\nthe perpetrators or the targets of such threats.\\\\n    You and our other national security officials have \\\\nrepeatedly warned us that foreign actors are actively working \\\\nto spread disin-\\\\nformation to influence our elections and discredit our public \\\\ninstitutions, and we shouldn&#x27;t be aiding and abetting them.\\\\n    So, to live in a country that we aspire to where our most \\\\nvalued democratic processes, like free and fair elections, can \\\\nbe carried out unimpeded and people can run for office, serve \\\\ntheir communities, and exercise their right to vote without \\\\nfear of violence, we have had some concern about violence \\\\naround our elections.\\\\n    In 2020, the endorsement and promulgation of falsehoods \\\\nabout the election results by the former President and his \\\\ncampaign led to threats and attacks against election officials \\\\nand poll workers in Pennsylvania. Those falsehoods also wasted \\\\nmillions of taxpayer dollars on frivolous lawsuits and \\\\nextraordinary security costs.\\\\n    So, as we are again approaching November, we want to ensure \\\\nthat those who implement and defend our elections, our \\\\nneighbors and our nonpartisan civil servants, can do that \\\\nimportant work free from conspiracy theories and threats.\\\\n    So, we know our local law enforcement across Pennsylvania \\\\nare preparing for some disruptions and threats. Because while \\\\nPennsylvania may be a battleground State in the upcoming \\\\nelection, that battle should obviously be a war of words over \\\\npolicy and the vision we are charting for our country&#x27;s future, \\\\nnot an actual civil war.\\\\n    So, how is the FBI working with State and local law \\\\nenforcement to prevent and respond to election-related \\\\nviolence, particularly against election workers?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, in a variety of ways we are partnering with \\\\nState and local law enforcement. Obviously, physical security \\\\nin the first instance, in most of the respects you are talking \\\\nabout is in the ordinary course the responsibility of State and \\\\nlocal law enforcement. We play an important role in a number of \\\\nways.\\\\n    So, we share threat bulletins, information like that about \\\\nthings to be on the lookout for, things we are seeing. If we \\\\never have specific threat information, then we work to get it \\\\nto the right people.\\\\n    We have election crime coordinators, which we have had for \\\\ndecades, in all 56 field offices who have existing \\\\nrelationships with not just State and local law enforcement, \\\\nbut election officials, especially focused on security and \\\\nthreat-related issues.\\\\n    Then of course we are participating in the election threats \\\\ntask force that DOJ set up, which is focused on threats of \\\\nviolence or actual violence against election workers \\\\nspecifically. We have had a number of arrests and even some \\\\nconvictions already on that.\\\\n    Ms. Scanlon. Thank you for your input.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    Director, it is my intention to go approximately another \\\\nhalf an hour, then we will break for the Prime Minister of \\\\nIsrael&#x27;s address to the Congress on the floor, give you a \\\\nchance for lunch, then resume after that. We will keep pushing \\\\nthrough for the next half hour if we can.\\\\n    The gentlelady from Indiana is recognized.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Wray. Think you have a little bit \\\\nbetter tone in conversation, so I appreciate it in answer some \\\\nquestions. So, I appreciate it.\\\\n    Hopefully you will answer also two letters that I sent you \\\\nover a year ago, one related to Durham Report and the other one \\\\nrelated to Russian-infiltrated SBU that collaborated with FBI. \\\\nSo, hopefully we will get these answers and hopefully we&#x27;ll do \\\\nan authorization.\\\\n    Don&#x27;t you think doing an authorization would help us to get \\\\nbetter answers? Congress should probably work on authorizing \\\\nyour agency, don&#x27;t you agree with that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We work very hard to try to get information to \\\\nthis Committee and to other Committees.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. To authorize and spend probably would be a good \\\\nthing for us to do, don&#x27;t you agree?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Oh, I&#x27;m sorry, authorized and what?\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. Oh, spending, not just doing appropriating, but \\\\nactually doing authorization of spendings for this Committee.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. OK, thank you, we might start doing that. We \\\\ncan talk about, and a lot of my colleagues on the other side, \\\\nAR-15 gets a lot of bad rap. Like bring it up this issue.\\\\n    Really there are a lot of hunting rifles that probably may \\\\nbe even more accurate than a lot of ARs. Don&#x27;t you--we have \\\\nlike millions, right. Don&#x27;t you agree, we have millions of \\\\nrifles owned by law-abiding Americans.\\\\n    So, do you think we should be taking them, millions of \\\\nrifles from law-abiding Americans? What do you think about \\\\nthat? Would that be something feasible and really, we should be \\\\ndoing that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, I am not going to be addressing \\\\nanybody&#x27;s specific legislative proposal. From our perspective, \\\\nfrom the FBI&#x27;s perspective, the concern is any dangerous weapon \\\\nin the hands--in the wrong hands.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. All weapons are--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. In the hands of the wrong person.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. All weapons are dangerous, right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am sorry?\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. All weapons are dangerous.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Sure.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. Knives are dangerous and explosives are \\\\ndangerous.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Weapons are by their very definition dangerous.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. Yes, but are we going to be confiscating \\\\nhunting rifles and rifles for millions of Americans? Do you \\\\nthink it is even feasible to do something like that for law-\\\\nabiding citizens?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. It is not something I am advocating.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. OK, well, thank you, I appreciate that. So, we \\\\nhave to go back. That was a catastrophic failure of security \\\\nthat happened recently with attempted assassination, don&#x27;t you \\\\nagree with that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I think former Director Cheatle has already \\\\npublicly acknowledged that it was, I think her words were ``a \\\\nsignificant operational failure.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. Yes. Then we had similar situation and \\\\ndifferent talking about bad optics, Speaker Pelosi at the time \\\\ndidn&#x27;t want to have bad optics on January 6th. We didn&#x27;t have \\\\nproper security here on January 6th. That was a catastrophic \\\\nfailure too.\\\\n    Are we looking at that, any one conclusion was made from \\\\nthat? Have we--making any adjustments? Because not a lot of \\\\npeople got hurt, now, just being here it was a lot of cases \\\\nbrought up with Department of Justice. There were, a lot of \\\\nthem were really just law-abiding Americans that really just \\\\nupset with the government and they have a reason to do it.\\\\n    So, I think we need to think about it before we prosecute \\\\ninstead of actually looking at how we can deal with real \\\\ncriminals and how we can have a proper security when we have \\\\nevents with so many people there.\\\\n    So, did you have confidential human sources? I think you \\\\nnever answered that question on January 6th in the Capitol. Did \\\\nyou have some?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am sorry, what&#x27;s the question?\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. Confidential human sources, did you have them \\\\non January 6th in the Capitol?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, I am never going to be getting into \\\\nwhen and where we have or have not used confidential human \\\\nsources, but--\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. Are you willing to say on the record that you \\\\nhad no confidential human sources that went into Capitol on \\\\nJanuary 6th?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. As I have said consistently, I am not going to \\\\nget into where we have or have not used confidential human \\\\nsources. I can tell you that if you are asking if the violence \\\\nat the Capitol on January 6th was part of some operation \\\\norchestrated by FBI sources or agents, the answer is no.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. I didn&#x27;t ask you that--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. It is a disservice to our people.\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. I ask did you investigate if any confidential \\\\nhuman sources, did you do any investigation in looking at that? \\\\nYou are not answering if you had any or not. So, if you had \\\\npotentially--did you do anything you needed to make sure to \\\\ninvestigate that none of your sources did anything wrong, if \\\\nthey were prosecuted the same way as you are trying to \\\\nprosecute a lot of people that really, even Supreme Court ruled \\\\nrecently that some unconstitutional charges?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Let me just add that there have now been 180 \\\\nindividuals who have gone to trial, in addition to the 850 who \\\\npled guilty--\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. Right, but I think the problem is you put these \\\\ncharges--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Let me--may I--\\\\n    Ms. Spartz. A lot of people would plead guilty. Let me say \\\\njust quickly because I only have 10 seconds really, so I hope \\\\nyou will take seriously what you are doing.\\\\n    Related to the border security is also a crisis. Have the \\\\nVice President was leading on that. Has she, actually--she \\\\ninitiated meetings with you to lead, like weekly or monthly \\\\nmeeting where she actually get briefings from you as a leading \\\\nborder czar that had that function? Have you had that, has she \\\\ninitiated any meetings on a regular basis with you?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentlelady&#x27;s time has expired. The \\\\ngentleman can respond.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Right. On this issue of confidential human \\\\nsources, first, I will say there is a DOJ OIG review that is \\\\nunderway that addresses some of these kinds of topics, I \\\\nbelieve, but I won&#x27;t speak for the Inspector General.\\\\n    Second, as to this suggestion, which I have heard all too \\\\nmany times, that somehow January was orchestrated by FBI agents \\\\nor sources, I will note that, in addition, to my prior \\\\ncomments, that there have now been 850-ish individuals who have \\\\npled guilty, another 180 who have gone to trial.\\\\n    They have all had access to defense counsel, discovery, all \\\\nthe things the Constitution and the rules provide them. It has \\\\nbeen in front of something like 15 different judges, I think \\\\ndozens of juries. Not one has given credence to this notion. In \\\\nfact, I don&#x27;t think any of them have even really seriously to \\\\nraise it.\\\\n    So, it is not just my word for it, look what has happened \\\\nin the cases. Thank you.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for \\\\nfive minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Neguse. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Wray, for being here, for your \\\\ntestimony today, for the work that you do each and every day \\\\nand that your front-line agents across the country do each and \\\\nevery day to protect Americans. They keep our country safe.\\\\n    I am also grateful for the work that you are doing in \\\\ninvestigating the horrific events of July 13th, and the \\\\nattempted assassination of former President Trump, which \\\\neveryone must and has condemned.\\\\n    I would first just ask; do you believe that the FBI has the \\\\nadequate resources to ultimately ensure that your agency gets \\\\nto the bottom of it and fully investigates this terrible crime?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we are devoting massive amounts of \\\\nresources to this specific investigation. We have easily \\\\nseveral hundred FBI agents, analysts, and professional staff \\\\nworking on it. It is, involves over half of the FBI&#x27;s 56 field \\\\noffices, almost every headquarters division.\\\\n    We even have some of our overseas offices working on it. \\\\nYou might say, well, why is that. Well, because some of the \\\\ncompanies that involve accounts or purchases or communications \\\\nor what have you that the shooter used are foreign companies. \\\\nSo, we have to get evidence from overseas from those companies.\\\\n    I talked about our lab a little bit earlier today. We have \\\\ngot our Office of Technology Division working on the digital \\\\ndevices. We have our Behavioral Analysis Unit, our BAU, working \\\\non helping us build out a profile of the shooter. I could go on \\\\nand on and on. So, it is all hands-on deck on this case, as I \\\\nthink is appropriate.\\\\n    Now, when you ask about our resources, I have been public \\\\nabout the fact that the Fiscal Year 2024 budget put us $500 \\\\nmillion below where we needed to be to sustain current \\\\noperations.\\\\n    On Fiscal Year 2025, current House mark would put us \\\\nsignificantly further back behind that and would result in \\\\nsignificant risks across every program and our support to State \\\\nand local law enforcement.\\\\n    We arrested something like 50 violent criminals per day, \\\\nevery day, last year. The current mark would mean more violent \\\\ncriminals on the street, more neighborhoods at risk. We have \\\\nabout a 1,300 percent increase in our investigations related to \\\\nChina and its targeting of us. I can assure you China is not \\\\ncutting its budget. This would mean more threats from China.\\\\n    We have something like 300-400 investigations just into \\\\ncartel leadership. About hardly a week goes by when some FBI \\\\nfield office isn&#x27;t seizing enough fentanyl to wipe out an \\\\nentire State. That mark, those cuts mean more fentanyl on the \\\\nstreet, more people dying.\\\\n    So, the people who suffer the most are State and local law \\\\nenforcement and the American people we are sworn to protect.\\\\n    Mr. Neguse. Let me just--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, look forward to working with Congress, but we \\\\nreally need to be smart about what we are doing. I think that \\\\nwould be a step in the wrong direction, given the threat of the \\\\nenvironment that we face.\\\\n    Mr. Neguse. I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more, Director Wray. \\\\nOf course, we have talked about this in a very previous \\\\nhearings at which you have testified.\\\\n    To be clear, I think the budget that House Republicans have \\\\nproposed, which is about a $325 million cut to the FBI, would \\\\nprecisely what you have described and have deleterious impacts \\\\nfor public safety across our country. The House Democrats are \\\\ncertainly working to prevent those cuts from taking place.\\\\n    You have talked at great length about the events of July \\\\n13th. There is justifiably a lot of public interest in the \\\\ninvestigation, which we understand is ongoing. Wonder if there \\\\nis anything that you would like to disclose or provide to the \\\\nCommittee or to the public that perhaps has not yet been \\\\ngleaned during the course of this hearing and just give you an \\\\nopportunity. Because there are a lot of folks--related to the \\\\ninvestigation.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. One thing I can give an update on, which if \\\\npretty fresh here, we had some conversations with some of the \\\\nMembers about the access to the roof and the ladder and so \\\\nforth.\\\\n    Our evidence response teams and their forensic collection, \\\\nwe now believe that the subject climbed onto the roof using \\\\nsome mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on \\\\nthe side of the AGR building. In other words, we do not believe \\\\nhe used a ladder to get up there.\\\\n    Mr. Neguse. One question, if the Chair might indulge me \\\\nwith just a few extra seconds, there is an article recently \\\\nregarding several former Trump Administration national security \\\\nofficials who had received a duty-to-warn briefing from the FBI \\\\nregarding the potential threat from Iran.\\\\n    I think there is this article made clear deep concern these \\\\nindividuals have, justifiably so, about the threat level, and \\\\nparticularly given the events of the last several months and \\\\nthe need for there to be an increased security posture and \\\\nsecurity personnel for former officials who may very well still \\\\nbe at risk.\\\\n    I don&#x27;t know if you are familiar with that article. I am \\\\ntrying not to use names here, but I think would perhaps \\\\nfollowup with your agency and with the Department of Justice \\\\nmore broadly to ensure that any individuals who are potentially \\\\nfacing a threat from Iran or another hostile actor, foreign \\\\nnation, have the resources they need to have the security \\\\navailable to them.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, again, without reference to any specific \\\\nindividual, I want to be very clear about this, because I have \\\\ntried to be vocal on this, but it sometimes doesn&#x27;t get noticed \\\\nas much, which is that in my view, the Iranian Government has \\\\nbeen extremely aggressive and brazen.\\\\n    We have seen in the last few years an attempt, I am \\\\nspeaking just from public information now, an attempt to \\\\nassassinate a former U.S. National Security Advisor on U.S. \\\\nsoil. We have seen an attempt first to kidnap, and then to try \\\\nto murder, an American dissident/journalist who is a critic of \\\\nthe Iranian regime, right smack in the middle of New York City.\\\\n    We have a cyber-attack against a children&#x27;s hospital in New \\\\nEngland that ties back Iran. We have seen, as I have testified \\\\nbefore, as Director Ratcliffe and I announced, an effort by the \\\\nIranians to target the 2020 Presidential Election.\\\\n    That is all before you even get to the fact that the \\\\nIranian Government is the leading State sponsor of terrorism. \\\\nSo, if that is not enough to convince people that Iran is a \\\\nthreat, I don&#x27;t know what is.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Director, was there a distinction between \\\\nwhat the gentleman from Colorado raised and what you just said, \\\\nthese general concerns and these specific incidents you talk \\\\nabout, and a direct, specific threat on President Trump that is \\\\ndistinct from what you have been describing as this general \\\\nconcern with Iran?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, I can&#x27;t get into specific pieces of \\\\nclassified--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. If so, when, if it was a distinct threat on \\\\nPresident Trump when did that take place?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, all I can tell you, certainly in this kind \\\\nof setting, is targeting of U.S. officials for the Soleimani \\\\nstrike is something that is a reality that the Iranian \\\\nGovernment has at times called for very publicly.\\\\n    Whenever there is reporting--let me try to answer your \\\\nquestion this way: Whenever there is reporting about any of \\\\nthose protectees, we share the information in a variety of \\\\nways, working with the intelligence community, working with \\\\nwhoever is the protective service with responsibility for that \\\\nindividual. We do it in a timely way using the duty-to-warn \\\\nprocess that was just referred to.\\\\n    To my knowledge, everything along those lines that is \\\\nrelevant was shared in a timely way with the relevant people.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Thank you. The gentleman from Wisconsin is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Director Wray, thanks for being here. Where \\\\nwere you when you heard that President Trump was shot, and then \\\\nwhat were your immediate actions/response to that as Director?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I was about to have dinner with my family. I was \\\\nhorrified and angry.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. I am just thinking--the reason I asked the \\\\nquestion is because I am thinking. I am still trying to figure \\\\nout the lanes, what the FBI would respond to and what the \\\\nSecret Service has the responsibility to respond to. Can you \\\\njust kind of cover that again?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Sure. So, the FBI is not responsible for--it&#x27;s \\\\nnever really been part of our mandate or mission for the \\\\nphysical security of venues, of specific protectees or anything \\\\nlike that. That&#x27;s if it&#x27;s somebody within Secret Service&#x27;s \\\\nscope, that&#x27;s their mandate and mission.\\\\n    We are a law enforcement and intelligence agency. So, if \\\\nyou think about it this way, we&#x27;re the Federal Bureau of \\\\nInvestigation. We&#x27;re not the Federal Bureau of Security. You \\\\nmight say, ``Well, what&#x27;s the difference?&#x27;&#x27; Well, there is a \\\\ndifference.\\\\n    We investigate crimes. We investigate threats to national \\\\nsecurity, but we don&#x27;t--questions about security posture, the \\\\nadequacy of resources and assets that were deployed to protect \\\\na specific individual, whether there&#x27;s enough security and \\\\ncertainly the staffing of that security, is not something the \\\\nFBI--again, we&#x27;re 116 years old--has historically done.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. So, at this point, have you been able to go \\\\nthrough the shooter&#x27;s home and document what you found as far \\\\nas evidence goes?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, we were able to search the shooter&#x27;s home. \\\\nSo, again, just sort of tying your first question to your \\\\nsecond question now, our role is to conduct an investigation of \\\\nthe shooter and the attack. So, we&#x27;re going to conduct a \\\\npainstaking, intense investigation of that.\\\\n    We have, among other scenes that we&#x27;ve processed using \\\\nevidence response teams--in addition to the rally scene itself, \\\\nof course, we have been through the individual&#x27;s, the shooter&#x27;s \\\\nhome, his bedroom, other parts of the house, et cetera.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Have you been able to establish that he did \\\\ngo to a range and either zero that weapon in or at least target \\\\nshoot that weapon prior to the assassination attempt?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, we do assess that he went to a shooting range \\\\nthe day--not the only time he went to a shooting range; he was \\\\na fairly--avid might be a little strong, but a fairly avid \\\\nshooting hobbyist. So, he went to--belonged to different sort \\\\nof clubs and went to certain ranges and that kind of thing.\\\\n    We do believe based on what we&#x27;ve seen so far that he went \\\\nto a shooting range the day before and that he shot an AR-style \\\\nrifle at that range the day before. I&#x27;m not sure we know for \\\\nsure that it&#x27;s the weapon that he used, but I think we assessed \\\\nthat it probably is.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Have you been able to interview his \\\\nparents?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, we have.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Was there anything that was gained from \\\\nthat interview that would lead you to believe that they \\\\ncertainly were aware of what was going on?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I guess I want to be careful talking about \\\\nspecific people&#x27;s interviews, but I would say that his parents \\\\nwere cooperative with us. As I&#x27;ve said before--and hopefully \\\\nthis gets to your question--we have not identified any \\\\naccomplices, co-conspirators, or anything along those lines.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. So, is it the FBI&#x27;s position right now that \\\\nhe still acted independently?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again, we&#x27;re still--I know it seems like a \\\\nlifetime since--\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Right. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. --July 13th, but we&#x27;re still early stages. We \\\\nhave not seen anything so far that would suggest to us that he \\\\nacted with others.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. How does the FBI view not just a Trump \\\\nrally but political rallies versus other types of events from a \\\\nsecurity perspective compared to a college football game or any \\\\nmass large crowd-type gathering? Because I can&#x27;t--I think one \\\\nof the things that is most difficult to really swallow at this \\\\npoint is that the idea that these Trump rallies have been \\\\nhappening for years and that there could be such a lax approach \\\\nto the physical security of those fairgrounds that day.\\\\n    I am wondering, where does this fall? Then, on top of that \\\\nthere were other Presidential Candidates out there that didn&#x27;t \\\\nhave full Secret Service protection. RFK, Jr., has been the \\\\nmost vocal about it. I was wondering if you could comment on \\\\nthe facilities as well as providing security for Presidential \\\\nCandidates.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, I want to be a little bit careful to \\\\nstay in my lane because, again, security posture and the \\\\nadequacy of the security posture is really the core expertise \\\\nand responsibility of agencies like the Secret Service. \\\\nCertainly, it is fair to say that outdoor events, whether \\\\nthey&#x27;re political rallies or, as you say a college football \\\\ngame in an open stadium, a concert, these are places that are \\\\noften particularly challenging to secure adequately because the \\\\nrange of threats that can face them are higher.\\\\n    In addition to that, as has been discussed a little bit \\\\nhere already in today&#x27;s hearing, just threats to public \\\\nofficials, including politicians, is an increasingly pervasive \\\\npart of today&#x27;s landscape. So, that adds to the challenge. So, \\\\nyou&#x27;re talking about the combination of individuals who are \\\\nincreasingly targeted for violence combined with venues that \\\\nare softer and harder-to-secure targets, I guess, is the way I \\\\nwould answer.\\\\n    Again, those kinds of questions--the adequacy of the \\\\nsecurity posture, all the resources that were or were not \\\\ndevoted--all that stuff, it is my understanding, would be very \\\\nmuch in scope for the DHS Inspector General investigation and \\\\nthis outside independent panel that&#x27;s been appointed.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Director, I think we are going to be able to get two more \\\\nMembers time to question; then we have to get to the floor for \\\\nthe Prime Minister.\\\\n    The gentlelady from Georgia is recognized.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Thank you, Chair Johnson.\\\\n    Thank you so much, Director Wray, for your transparency and \\\\nyour testimony today.\\\\n    First, I want to say my friend, my mentor, Congresswoman \\\\nSheila Jackson Lee, was known by many as the voice of reason \\\\nhere in Congress. She was my friend before I even came to \\\\nCongress. In my freshman year, she kind of took me under her \\\\nwing, and she showed me the ropes. She was a force to be \\\\nreckoned with. I can say that she will never, ever be replaced. \\\\nShe was a trailblazer, and I know that she will sorely be \\\\nmissed here in Congress.\\\\n    Director Wray, I only have one question for you today. \\\\nBefore we get to that point; I would just like to reiterate \\\\ntoday that political violence is never acceptable. Regardless \\\\nof how different our political values and views are, attempted \\\\nassassinations are a stain to the very democratic ideals of \\\\nthis Nation.\\\\n    We have endured riots on Capitol Hill on January 6th, where \\\\na literal noose was erected on Capitol grounds, intended for \\\\nthen Vice President Pence and Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi; \\\\npolitical violence against election workers--that has been \\\\nexpressed today; an attack on Paul Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s \\\\nhusband; threats against the FBI agents, as you have expressed, \\\\nand prosecutors; and threats to the staff who serve the public \\\\nevery single day. Congressman Connolly&#x27;s staff was targeted and \\\\nattacked last year.\\\\n    Now, we have the attempted assassination of a former \\\\nPresident of the United States--all this within just the last \\\\nthree years. This violence simply needs to end. The \\\\nassassination attempt on Donald Trump was, by the grace of God, \\\\na failure.\\\\n    The weapon the 20-year-old man was able to obtain, an AR-\\\\n15, generally has a shooting range up to 600 yards and shot Mr. \\\\nTrump from almost 150 yards away. This weapon has the ability \\\\nto kill multiple people in seconds. Sadly, Corey Comperatore \\\\nlost his life because of this man and because of this gun. Mr. \\\\nComperatore&#x27;s family will never be the same. Trust me. I \\\\nunderstand that more than anyone else in this room.\\\\n    Is the near loss of a former President enough for this \\\\nCongress to finally take action? Because there are 206 of us \\\\nthat are already standing in the wings ready to take immediate \\\\naction to ban assault weapons today. We need only 12 more of \\\\nour colleagues to join us in courage and move the legislation \\\\nto save the lives of so many of the people that we are elected \\\\nto serve by removing assault weapons from the hands of people \\\\nwho simply should not have them in their possession.\\\\n    We are crippling our democracy, and we are ripping apart \\\\nour fellow Americans until we do. I ask today because, clearly \\\\nit wasn&#x27;t enough to take action when the lethality of assault \\\\nweapons--we lost 26 seven-year-olds and six teachers in 2012, \\\\nwhen I also lost my son to gun violence, or 14 teenagers and \\\\nthree more teachers in 2018. It wasn&#x27;t enough when we lost 19 \\\\nmore children and two more teachers in 2022.\\\\n    Well, is it enough now, now that a former President, the \\\\nvery President that many of you in this room are hoping will be \\\\nreelected, almost lost his life because this Congress has \\\\nfailed to reinState an assault weapons ban, a ban that, by the \\\\nway, Republicans joined with Democrats to pass 30 years ago?\\\\n    Well, fine. You all don&#x27;t like assault weapons ban; we can \\\\nbring another bill that I have introduced to a vote, the GOSAFE \\\\nAct. This bill focuses on the components of semiautomatic \\\\nfirearms and regulates their infrastructure, sale, and \\\\ntransfer. This, again, is not the time for thoughts and \\\\nprayers. This is a time for action.\\\\n    Director Wray, just one question I have for you. Would you \\\\nrather have your officers protected or protect someone against \\\\nan assault weapon being shot from 147 yards away or a standard \\\\npistol with no accessories attached?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, I&#x27;m going to refrain from appearing \\\\nto comment on specific legislative proposals. I can tell you \\\\nthat we are certainly concerned about the danger to law \\\\nenforcement from any kind of high-powered weapon in the wrong \\\\nhands. It hits close to home for us because just not that long \\\\nago, two great agents, Laura Schwartzenberger and Dan Alfin, \\\\ndown in Miami executing a search in a crimes-against-children \\\\ncase, were shot and killed by a subject with an automatic \\\\nweapon.\\\\n    So, again, dangerous weapons in the wrong hands are \\\\nsomething that of course, from a law enforcement perspective, \\\\nconcerns us. I&#x27;m not going to wade into the legislative \\\\nprocess.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Well, thank you for that answer. I would rather \\\\ngive our agents a fighting chance.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from Oregon is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Thank you, Director Wray, for being here today. So, we \\\\nspend $3 billion a year on the Secret Service. Three billion. \\\\nIt would seem that we could and should have had a better job \\\\ndone a few weeks ago on the 13th than what we saw. Will you \\\\nhave anything to say about correcting what are the obvious \\\\ndeficiencies in what the Secret Service did?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, for the most part, the deficiencies or \\\\nadequacy or inadequacy of the Secret Service&#x27;s performance, \\\\ndecisionmaking, resources--all that stuff is in the purview of \\\\nthose two other investigations. That is the DHS Inspector \\\\nGeneral and the outside independent panel that&#x27;s been \\\\nannounced.\\\\n    Having said that, our investigation, which, as I&#x27;ve \\\\ntestified now, involves several hundred FBI employees and every \\\\nasset we can bring to bear of the shooter--again, our \\\\ninvestigation is of the shooter and his attack--of course \\\\ninvolving interviewing law enforcement, including lots and lots \\\\nand lots of Secret Service people. So, we&#x27;ll share all that \\\\nwith those reviews so that they can answer those questions.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. The reason I am asking this is because this \\\\nisn&#x27;t the first time the Secret Service has been before \\\\nCongress. There was a 435-page report issued in 2015 by \\\\nCongress saying, ``Fix yourself.&#x27;&#x27; They didn&#x27;t. In fact, there \\\\nwas a followup in 2019 where they had only done a few of the--I \\\\nthink it was 18 or 19 different specific things they were \\\\nsupposed to do. They had done some, but certainly not all.\\\\n    There was another followup in 2022. Again, the Secret \\\\nService had not done what Congress had asked. I guess my \\\\nquestion to you, Mr. Director, is what should Congress do? You \\\\nhave a 435-page report nine years ago, and still, the Secret \\\\nService didn&#x27;t do what it was told to do then.\\\\n    Can you help, Director Wray? Because this type of \\\\nperformance is not acceptable.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, as I think even former Director Cheatle has \\\\nacknowledged, this was a significant operational failure. If \\\\nthere are ways for the FBI to be helpful beyond what we&#x27;re \\\\nalready doing in terms of our investigation, we stand ready to \\\\ntry to be helpful.\\\\n    I do want to say, as somebody who&#x27;s been in law enforcement \\\\nfor most of my career, I&#x27;ve worked with some phenomenal Secret \\\\nService agents going all the way back to my time as a line \\\\nprosecutor. They have an incredibly hard job, and I have a lot \\\\nof affection and respect for the men and women in the Secret \\\\nService.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. I am sure you do, and I am sure you are right. \\\\nThe trouble is, when Congress says, ``You need to do these 19 \\\\nthings,&#x27;&#x27; and you don&#x27;t, something needs to change. Now, the \\\\nDirector has resigned. You are going to be in a position, \\\\nbecause your Agency is doing such a careful review, to say a \\\\nlot about what should have been done.\\\\n    I guess the real issue is much more of what the higher-ups \\\\nin that Agency are or are not doing. Perhaps that is on us.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. We will share. We will share, with those \\\\nreviews, anything that we come across that could be helpful or \\\\nrelevant to them for those questions.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. Yes. Let me quickly go to some details about the \\\\nactual events. It appeared to a lot of us, as the Secret \\\\nService was taking former President Trump from the stage, that \\\\nhe was clearly still in view of everybody. Had there been \\\\nanother shooter, I didn&#x27;t see him being protected. Are you \\\\ngoing to raise that issue?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I think that&#x27;s really more in scope of these two \\\\nother reviews, probably both of them.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. Let me go to--OK. That&#x27;s fine. Let me go to the \\\\nshooter. As he was on top of the roof, apparently, another \\\\nofficer from another police division saw him and quickly ducked \\\\ndown because the shooter aimed a gun at him. Then the shooter \\\\napparently--was he prone at the time he took the shot toward \\\\nthe President?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, my understanding is that the local officer \\\\nwho they were talking about, with the assistance of another \\\\nlocal officer, was able to kind of get up and see onto the \\\\nroof, where he observed the shooter, I believe in a prone \\\\nshooting position. The shooter then turned and faced him, the \\\\nlocal officer, with the weapon.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. From the prone position?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That&#x27;s my understanding.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. Then he went back to the prone position.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. This was all seconds before the shooter took \\\\nhis--\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. That entire time, the shooter was in the scope \\\\nsight of the counter-sniper, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That one I&#x27;d have to double-check on. I know \\\\nwe&#x27;ve interviewed the counter-sniper, but I&#x27;m not sure I know \\\\nthe answer--\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. The counter-sniper didn&#x27;t take a shot until \\\\nafter the assassin attempted to shoot the former President and \\\\nothers. He got off eight shots before the counter-sniper shot \\\\nthe shooter. What is with that protocol? Can you get that \\\\nfixed?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, I really want to be careful not to \\\\nbe giving the scope of our investigation, somehow second-\\\\nguessing the very difficult act and decision it takes for a \\\\ncounter-sniper to kill another human being in that situation. \\\\nIt&#x27;s all happening in seconds, so--\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. Eight shots.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Bentz. That was after he&#x27;d been seen for 20 minutes.\\\\n    I yield back. Thank you.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Director, that is an important question, \\\\nthough, because you have talked to the counter-sniper. That--I \\\\nmentioned this in our opening statement. That critical five \\\\nminutes from 6:09-6:14 p.m. and what takes place there is \\\\ncritical. I think that is what the gentleman was getting at. We \\\\nare hopeful that you could tell us something about your \\\\ninterview with the counter-sniper.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes. I guess I want to distinguish a couple \\\\nthings. There is some individual, not law enforcement, I \\\\nbelieve, who spotted the shooter on the roof a few minutes \\\\nbefore. I think law enforcement spotted him with the weapon on \\\\nthe roof is seconds before the shot.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK. That is important because--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes. There are two different things going on.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. If what you&#x27;re saying is it wasn&#x27;t--maybe \\\\nthat is--if the bad guy shoots at 6:11 p.m., then you are \\\\nsaying this encounter with local law enforcement that Mr. Bentz \\\\nwas just getting into happened just seconds before that and \\\\nmaybe not two minutes before that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That&#x27;s my understanding, in other words, that \\\\nthere&#x27;s different things here. There&#x27;s individual--at least one \\\\nindividual I can think of, not law enforcement, a member of the \\\\npublic, who observed him on the roof. Not clear whether or not \\\\nthe individual saw a weapon or not but saw him in a way that \\\\nwas concerning.\\\\n    That is some number of--not many, but like just a handful \\\\nof minutes. I think separate from that, as far as law \\\\nenforcement goes in terms of a weapon, this local officer that \\\\nwe just talked about observed the individual, again, literally \\\\njust seconds before the individual, the shooter, took his \\\\nshots.\\\\n    Separate and apart from all that roughly, maybe a little \\\\nless--or around an hour before the shooting, there were local \\\\nlaw enforcement officers who observed the shooter, not up on \\\\nthe roof, not with a weapon, but with, I believe, a range \\\\nfinder like you would use if you were playing golf or \\\\nsomething, in a way that was odd and suspicious.\\\\n    So, that started happening with local law enforcement \\\\nbeforehand. In terms of shooter, meaning with the weapon, law \\\\nenforcement--my understanding is that the first time that \\\\nhappened was this local officer climbing up on the roof seconds \\\\nbefore the shooter--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Again, we want that timeline. I think the \\\\nCommittee wants that timeline and communications that were \\\\ntaking place in that short period of time.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again, as I&#x27;ve said with everything else, I \\\\nreally want to be careful. I&#x27;m leaning in--trying to share as \\\\nmuch as I can here. Facts are evolving. Things may change. We \\\\nare working on a timeline, among other things.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The Committee will stand in recess until \\\\nafter the Prime Minister&#x27;s remarks conclude.\\\\n    [Recess.]\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The Committee will come to order. The \\\\ngentlelady from North Carolina is recognized for five minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you so much Director \\\\nWray for being with us yet again.\\\\n    As you know, we&#x27;ve seen a disturbing rise in domestic \\\\nterrorism and far right extremism across the United States. \\\\nWe&#x27;ve heard from you several times about this.\\\\n    White supremacists and far-right extremist groups continue \\\\nto outpace all types of terrorism and domestic violent \\\\nextremism according to the National Institute of Justice report \\\\nfrom this past January.\\\\n    Part of this dramatic rise in extremist violence and \\\\nthreats stems from a line of foreign actors who are actively \\\\nworking to sow division in American democracy. They&#x27;re \\\\ndesperately trying to inflame extremists and deepen divides all \\\\nto support far right agendas and candidates that will erode our \\\\ndemocracy.\\\\n    The DHS threat assessment has warned, we expect the 2024 \\\\nelection cycle will be a key event for possible violence and \\\\nforeign influence, targeting our election infrastructure, \\\\nprocesses, and personnel. Microsoft has warned that the 2024 \\\\nelection may be the first Presidential election during which \\\\nmultiple authoritarian actors simultaneously attempt to \\\\ninterfere with and influence election outcomes.\\\\n    National security officials and experts have warned that \\\\nforeign governments, mainly Russia, China, and Iran, seek to \\\\ndestabilize the United States via its elections, by sowing \\\\nfurther division in the American electorate. This is happening \\\\nand happening in the current context of increased political \\\\nviolence in our country against a former President, election \\\\nworkers, judges, Members of Congress and their families, and \\\\nother public servants.\\\\n    I cannot emphasize enough that this is a national security \\\\nthreat. Director Wray, reports have found that these propaganda \\\\ncampaigns will sometimes target racial groups.\\\\n    Why would countries like Russia, China, Iran, seek to \\\\ninflame racial tensions via social media?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, of course, it may vary from adversary to \\\\nadversary. The playbook for authoritarian regimes in today&#x27;s \\\\nworld is to try to sow divisiveness and discord to turn us \\\\nagainst each other, to capitalize on existing social tensions \\\\nthat they perceive.\\\\n    To try to, in effect, pour gasoline on the fire and \\\\nintensify those conflicts that may already exist in our \\\\ndomestic political scene.\\\\n    So, rather than if you&#x27;re a foreign adversary that means us \\\\nno good, rather than try to come up with some completely brand \\\\nnew issue or theory or narrative to turn us against each other, \\\\nyou look for things where we&#x27;re already, at the very least, \\\\nquarreling with each other, if not fighting with each other.\\\\n    Then, they try to capitalize on that and amp it up. Of \\\\ncourse, that can then sometimes, as we&#x27;ve seen all too \\\\ntragically, boil over or bubble over into outright violence.\\\\n    Ms. Ross. So, how has the FBI worked to combat this \\\\npropaganda and infiltration on our social media network?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, our focus is on the foreign actor, China, \\\\nRussia, Iran, and on their efforts. So, we work with the \\\\nintelligence community. We work with our foreign partners, our \\\\nfriendly foreign partners to try to uncover what those \\\\ncountries, Russia, China, and Iran, are up to.\\\\n    We try to share information about the hidden hand of the \\\\nforeign actor where it&#x27;s appropriate. We also engage in efforts \\\\nto disrupt those foreign actors.\\\\n    The most recent example with the Russians for example, is a \\\\nRussian government-linked generative AI social media bot farm, \\\\nwhere they were posing as, among others, U.S. persons, and not, \\\\nin fact, U.S. persons, and trying too again, sow various \\\\nnarratives.\\\\n    That case very heavily focused on the issue they picked \\\\nthere was the war in Ukraine. Again, trying to kind of get \\\\neverybody turned against each other.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve also seen that through from China and Iran. I \\\\nmentioned China before, we&#x27;ve had a case where we charged, it \\\\nwas 34 Chinese Ministry of Public Security, MPS Officers for \\\\nmuch the same kind of behavior, creating false personas, \\\\npretending to be Americans, and then trying to kind of sow \\\\nnarratives.\\\\n    In that case, in the Chinese case, their narratives were \\\\ntrying to, for example, undermine any suggestion that Covid was \\\\nthe product of a lab leak or attacking U.S. law enforcement at \\\\nthe anniversary of George Floyd&#x27;s death, for example.\\\\n    Then, Iran, in 2020, we saw them undertake similar kinds of \\\\nefforts that were disrupted in October 2020.\\\\n    Ms. Ross. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentlelady yields back. The gentleman \\\\nfrom Virginia is recognized for five minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Director Wray, thank you for being here. Thank \\\\nyou for the information that you&#x27;ve provided today. I greatly \\\\nappreciate it.\\\\n    This event that occurred, the attempted assassination of \\\\nPresident Trump on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania, was a \\\\nlevel five alarm alert to this country that our elected \\\\nofficials, our leaders, the President, and the former \\\\nPresident, are not safe.\\\\n    We need to reevaluate from the ground up, exactly how we \\\\nare to go about providing that protection. The information \\\\nyou&#x27;ve provided, dealing with eight cartridges from the roof, \\\\nthe drone, the fact that two explosive devices were found in \\\\nthe car, one at home that was a remote detonation device that \\\\nhe had on him, the fact that his phone was using encrypted \\\\nplatforms, he only had one phone, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;m sorry. Yes, he had one phone. Although we&#x27;ve \\\\nidentified other phones that he may have used that may not have \\\\nbeen his phone.\\\\n    So, for example, we think, in certain instances he might \\\\nhave used his dad&#x27;s phone. Again, not necessarily related to \\\\nthe attack.\\\\n    We&#x27;re trying to, we are trying to make sure that we process \\\\nand exploit every device he could have used. We keep, which is \\\\npart of why I keep making this point, which I know you all are \\\\nprobably tired of me making, about this being an ongoing \\\\ninvestigation. Because we keep identifying new pieces of \\\\nequipment, new accounts, what have you.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. The fact that you are, in real time, informing \\\\nus about what you&#x27;re finding as you&#x27;re performing this \\\\ninvestigation, is very helpful.\\\\n    Clarifying the fact that he went to the range the day \\\\nbefore and shot an AR. Now, my understanding is that the AR he \\\\nused on the 13th, was his father&#x27;s. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, yes and no. It was originally; his father \\\\nbought it legally.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Then, our understanding so far is that his father \\\\nthen conveyed it to him, sold it, in fact, to his son. So, \\\\noriginally his father&#x27;s, at the time of the shooting, the \\\\nshooter&#x27;s.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. OK. So, that&#x27;s new information. Was that \\\\nprovided to you by the father?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I think it was partly from that. I think we also \\\\nsaw some documentation to support it.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. OK. Investigators also have said that the \\\\nshooter posted, quote, ``July 13th will be my premier, watch as \\\\nit unfolds,&#x27;&#x27; on an online gaming platform sometime before he \\\\ntried to assassinate President Trump.\\\\n    Can you confirm that? How much time elapsed between this \\\\nposting and the attempt on July 13th?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I&#x27;m really glad you asked about that. Because \\\\nthat is a situation where, again, in our effort to give real \\\\ntime information, since we&#x27;ve provided that information, we \\\\nhave since learned that this July 13th premier profile page on \\\\nthe gaming platform, it turns out it was not the shooter.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That it was some other individual as part of some \\\\nsick joke, who, after the shooting, created a profile page \\\\npretending to be the shooter.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Wow.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, of course, we&#x27;ve now, that person has now \\\\nadmitted to it. Even my point being, among the other challenges \\\\nthat we as investigators have, you have people who create \\\\naccounts, in today&#x27;s world create accounts pretending to be \\\\nsomebody that they&#x27;re, and it&#x27;s not the actual person.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. The shooter--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That&#x27;s troubling, obviously. It makes our jobs \\\\neven harder as investigators.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Thank you for clarifying that. Did he have an \\\\nonline gaming account?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We do believe he was a gamer and that he had \\\\ndifferent kinds of gaming accounts. So, that&#x27;s part of why we, \\\\nyes.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Any the information gleaned from those?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Not yet. Again, some of those are some of those \\\\nlegal process returns I&#x27;m still waiting on.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Now, during the attempted assassination, Crooks \\\\nwas wearing a tee shirt from a popular YouTube Channel. Have \\\\nyou been able to access his selection of YouTube videos that \\\\nhe&#x27;s watched?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I believe we have seen some of his search \\\\nhistory. We&#x27;ve got a ways to go on that.\\\\n    I know there&#x27;s some manual work that we&#x27;re doing on that. \\\\nThe most notable thing that we&#x27;ve found recently, which I don&#x27;t \\\\nthink has been shared until today, is that on a laptop that the \\\\ninvestigation ties to him, that on July 6th, it revealed a \\\\nGoogle search.\\\\n    His search, if it was him, again, it&#x27;s a laptop tied to \\\\nhim.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We obviously believe it&#x27;s him. We&#x27;ll continue to \\\\ninvestigate it. His Google search was, ``how far away was \\\\nOswald from Kennedy?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Right. Horrifying.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Can you clarify that you have in your possession \\\\nall the video that was taken on that day at the scene?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We&#x27;ve collected mountains of video. Part of the \\\\nreason that I--\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Can you commit to providing us with that video?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we&#x27;re going to work with the Committee and \\\\nshare information as best we can. Part of the reason I hedged \\\\non whether we have it all, is as you can appreciate in today&#x27;s \\\\nworld, everybody with a phone--\\\\n    Mr. Cline. Sure.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Has the ability to take footage. So, we&#x27;re \\\\nfinding things kind of left and right.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. You have all the law enforcement videos?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I believe we have all the law enforcement video. \\\\nWe&#x27;re still collecting evidence.\\\\n    Mr. Cline. OK. I hope you would provide that to us and to \\\\nthe American people. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. Director, just to \\\\nbe clear, the photo and the message on the online gaming \\\\naccount, your testimony was to Mr. Cline that that was somebody \\\\nelse posing as the shooter. Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Correct. Somebody after--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. After the shooting.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. July 13th--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK. That&#x27;s all.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Created this profile, pretending to be the \\\\nshooter, and sent us down the rabbit trail, which we&#x27;ve now \\\\ntied off.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. That&#x27;s important information. The gentlelady \\\\nfrom Pennsylvania is recognized.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Director Wray, \\\\nfor being here. I want to add my voice to the chorus of folks \\\\nwho are just devastated by the illness and passing of Sheila \\\\nJackson Lee.\\\\n    What a champion. What a role model. I always called her the \\\\nhardest working Member of Congress. She was everywhere on every \\\\nissue. She&#x27;ll be greatly missed.\\\\n    Director Wray, I thank you for what you said earlier, which \\\\nis leaning in. This is such an extraordinary set of events, the \\\\nattempted assassination of Donald Trump.\\\\n    The stealing of the life of a father, a firefighter, \\\\nsomebody who protected lives, Corey Comperatore, serious \\\\ninjuries to two others. So, I thank you, because you are trying \\\\nto give us what you can without jeopardizing the investigation. \\\\nI think that&#x27;s very helpful.\\\\n    Did the shooter also investigate other high-profile folks? \\\\nWe had heard some reporting around that early on.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, you say investigate other folks. This is a \\\\nplace where we still have a lot more work to do. Part of what \\\\nwe did find was a bunch of cached images of a variety of public \\\\nfigures.\\\\n    Again, cached images are those images that you get when you \\\\npull up a news story from any number of news sites, if there \\\\nare photographs in the article, those images are automatically \\\\nput into your cache on your computer. So, it doesn&#x27;t \\\\nnecessarily mean that you were searching for that person&#x27;s \\\\nimage.\\\\n    We do have the fact that starting around, at least around \\\\nthe period of early July, so this search that I just mentioned \\\\nrelated to Oswald and Kennedy, that&#x27;s about July 6th, which is \\\\nthe same day, we believe, that he registered for the rally. The \\\\nday before, we traveled to the grounds for the first time.\\\\n    So, I think there is a certain amount of searches related \\\\nto former President Trump that during that period we&#x27;re seeing, \\\\nconsistent with some kind of planning or reconnaissance, if you \\\\nwant to call it that, in advance of the rally.\\\\n    That&#x27;s sort of confined to that, or concentrated maybe is a \\\\nbetter word, in that July period after the announcement of the \\\\nrally and before the shooting.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. Can you speak to the conveyance of the gun? This \\\\nis a 20-year-old young man. The father owned the gun \\\\noriginally. An AR-15, am I correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. An AR-styled. Yes, an AR-styled.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. AR-styled. A 20-year-old man. When did the father \\\\nsell the gun to him? What documents do you have? How much money \\\\ntranspired and what date was it?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes. I do know that, I like to say we believe, \\\\nbased on what we&#x27;ve seen, that his father, after purchasing the \\\\ngun legally, sold the gun to his son.\\\\n    I don&#x27;t have the date of that transfer or the amount of the \\\\ntransfer. Although, we may be able to get that to you so far, I \\\\njust don&#x27;t have it in front of me.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. Do you know when the father bought it?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We know. I don&#x27;t, as I&#x27;m sitting here testifying \\\\nin front of you, I don&#x27;t have that in front of me.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I don&#x27;t have it in my period reports.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. I&#x27;m just wondering if it&#x27;s proximate to this \\\\nevent.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I do not believe that the gun was purchased, that \\\\nis the gun that was used, I do not believe it was purchased \\\\nparticularly close in time to the shooting. How far in advance, \\\\nit may have been a year before, give or take.\\\\n    Again, we&#x27;ll go back and double check that on you. I do \\\\nknow that on the day of the shooting, at about 1:30 p.m., he \\\\nbought 50 rounds of ammunition.\\\\n    So, if you think about the day of, or if you back up a \\\\nlittle bit, so the day before, he goes to the shooting range. \\\\nThe day of, he goes to the grounds the morning of the event for \\\\naround an hour.\\\\n    He buys the ammunition at around 1:30 p.m.. At around 3:50 \\\\np.m. is when he&#x27;s back on the grounds of the rally. That&#x27;s when \\\\nhe used the drone that I&#x27;ve talked about already today.\\\\n    Then, of course, fast forward, until just after 6:00 p.m., \\\\nwhen the worst happened.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. We had thought, maybe over the weekend, there was \\\\na conversation around a classified briefing for Members. I hope \\\\nthat will happen as soon as it&#x27;s feasible for you and for the \\\\nother agencies involved.\\\\n    He got off eight shots. The reporting is that this was \\\\nunder six seconds, he got off eight shots, fatal to one.\\\\n    My question that I&#x27;ll leave you with--and I know I&#x27;m over \\\\ntime, Mr. Chair--is, we all decry political violence. We decry \\\\nany violence. We decry the rise in political violence.\\\\n    What can you tell us that we could do better? What do you \\\\nneed for you to be able to help this country reduce the \\\\npolitical violence tendencies?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. This is a moment wherein the most stark way \\\\npossible, all of us as Americans can see how out of control \\\\npolitical violence is in this country. It&#x27;s an opportunity for \\\\neverybody to come together and to try to show that this is not \\\\nthe kind of thing we&#x27;re going to tolerate in this country.\\\\n    The FBI&#x27;s role is to focus on violence and threats of \\\\nviolence. There is a role for others in the public square to \\\\naddress how people communicate in this country.\\\\n    Every day in our jobs, we see in social media in terms of \\\\nthreats that people are, we get thousands and thousands and \\\\nthousands and thousands and thousands of tips reported to us.\\\\n    The language that&#x27;s out there is just mind-bogglingly \\\\nhateful and violent sounding. People, sometimes as figures of \\\\nspeech, use expressions that are very violent expressions.\\\\n    So, that is a part of it. We could all do better in being a \\\\nlittle more thoughtful and measured in our language.\\\\n    Again, the FBI, we&#x27;ve got to stay in our lane. Our lane is \\\\nthe violence and the threat to violence. There&#x27;s a role for \\\\neverybody as Americans to try to see if we can take the \\\\ntemperature down.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. Agree. Thank you. Thank you for the extra time.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. OK.\\\\n    Ms. Dean. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman from North Dakota is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I really appreciate \\\\nyou correcting the gaming thing and about ``this is my coming \\\\nout party,&#x27;&#x27; because we&#x27;re asking you to do something and we&#x27;ve \\\\nhad acrimonious, you and I have actually had acrimonious \\\\nissues.\\\\n    We&#x27;re not here for a gotcha moment. We&#x27;re just not. Not on \\\\nthis. We&#x27;re asking you to give us information before the \\\\ninvestigation is complete.\\\\n    My only recommendation or suggestion would be when that \\\\nhappens, don&#x27;t necessarily wait until you ask, because don&#x27;t \\\\nwait for us to ask. Because there&#x27;s a--and I&#x27;ll go through why \\\\nin a second.\\\\n    I appreciate you coming in and I appreciate you telling us \\\\nthings. I appreciate you guys going against essentially your \\\\nnormal policy of waiting until an investigation is done, \\\\nbecause the American people need to know it.\\\\n    Here&#x27;s why. A guy with a range finder walking around that \\\\neverybody noticed and then couldn&#x27;t find. You know he scaled to \\\\nthe top of a roof within 150 yards, line of sight to the \\\\nPresident or a Republican former Presidential Candidate, by \\\\nclimbing a drainpipe and then, you said, some equipment.\\\\n    He was being pointed out by rally goers everywhere they \\\\ncould. Nobody could figure it out. There&#x27;s maybe supposed to be \\\\nlocal law enforcement in the building, either upstairs or \\\\ndownstairs. All of this is going on.\\\\n    I was talking to a colleague of mine yesterday on the floor \\\\nand it&#x27;s, I hate the conspiracy theories that come out. This is \\\\nnot the FBI&#x27;s purview. This is the Secret Service&#x27;s purview.\\\\n    This is so comically like, inept to the average, to have \\\\nthe average North Dakota citizen is just hey, look at this. \\\\nThey&#x27;re like, how could this possibly happen?\\\\n    So, by you giving us information in a really meaningful \\\\nway, even though we know the investigation is ongoing and \\\\nthings can change, that at least helps us to deal with that and \\\\nfigure out where we&#x27;re at.\\\\n    So, you&#x27;re doing all this. This guy had no combat training. \\\\nNo counter-surveillance training that you&#x27;re aware of, right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;m sorry. I couldn&#x27;t quite hear that.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. He had no combat training.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Oh, no, I don&#x27;t think any, and certainly no, what \\\\nwe would call, what you and I would call combat training. \\\\nObviously, he was a fairly active recreational shooter.\\\\n    So, he did plenty of shooting.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Yes. A lot of guys in Western North Dakota, \\\\nright?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. All of those different things. Somehow we \\\\ncame within under an inch of a Presidential Candidate being \\\\nshot and killed within 100 days out from an election.\\\\n    When you look at it, so just, I just want to be really \\\\nclear, because there is a lot of this. There is no evidence of \\\\nanother shooter, right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Another shooter,--\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. There&#x27;s the counter-sniper who took out the \\\\nshooter. Right, right. You&#x27;re talking about, like, another?\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Anybody else. You&#x27;re looking at his online \\\\nand seeing all that. There&#x27;s no evidence he had any other \\\\naccomplices on the scene that day, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Correct. Not that we&#x27;ve seen yet, certainly.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. You said, and Oversight has had a hearing, \\\\nDHS had a hearing, and we&#x27;re having a hearing now. The \\\\nInspector General is going to investigate. We&#x27;re probably \\\\nannouncing a bipartisan outside panel.\\\\n    There&#x27;s another investigation, too, right? Because somebody \\\\nhas to clear this shooter. Like, even though it is a Secret \\\\nService officer deploying his, when an FBI agent kills somebody \\\\nin the line of duty, what&#x27;s the process?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, we have what we call an agent involved \\\\nshooting, is what you&#x27;re getting at.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Maybe I&#x27;m have--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We have a whole process. Our inspection--\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. They get put on leave, paid leave. Get a \\\\nlawyer, depending on how it is, right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, those, some of those things depend. We \\\\nhave--our inspection division does a shoot review of each time \\\\nthere&#x27;s one of these situations.\\\\n    They sometimes have to coordinate with local prosecutors \\\\nwho are also doing some kind of review. So yes, Secret Service \\\\nwould have a similar kind of process for the counter-shooter.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Because you have to actually establish one \\\\nof the defenses to homicide. Just like you don&#x27;t do it in a \\\\ncourt system the same way everybody else does.\\\\n    You have to justify that this shooting was justified. So, \\\\nwhen the FBI does that, do they conduct that all internally?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Most of the time, yes. Every once in a while, \\\\nthere&#x27;s a situation where the Inspector General gets involved.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Do you know how the Secret Service does it?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. OK. I just think that&#x27;s important, because \\\\nwhen we&#x27;re talking about how this works, and I don&#x27;t think \\\\nanybody&#x27;s arguing it wasn&#x27;t, anybody who&#x27;s seen it and knows \\\\nwhat happened. It&#x27;s just, knowing it and making sure that the \\\\nprocess is handled correctly.\\\\n    I just wanted to shift gears with my last 30 seconds really \\\\nquickly, because we had a hearing on the Northern border in \\\\nGrand Forks. You were talking about specific threats from Iran, \\\\nbut also generally.\\\\n    We have diverted an exceptional amount of resources to the \\\\nSouthern border. Our interactions, 114 percent increase in \\\\napprehension.\\\\n    The one specific thing, with all due respect to my friends \\\\nand my neighbors from Canada, it&#x27;s a lot easier to get into \\\\nCanada from some of these countries where we have these real \\\\nissues with terrorist threats then it is to the United States, \\\\nparticularly Iran.\\\\n    Are you guys monitoring that and making sure whatever \\\\ncoordination you have with Canada, that we&#x27;re paying attention \\\\nto that as well?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We have an excellent relationship, we the FBI, \\\\nwith our Canadian counterparts, both RCMP the Mounties as some \\\\npeople with euphemistically call them, and CSIS, they&#x27;re my \\\\nintelligence service counterparts.\\\\n    We have great relations with them. Terrorism is, I find, \\\\nprobably the No. 1 thing we talk about.\\\\n    Mr. Armstrong. Yes. They&#x27;re understaffed and overworked on \\\\nthe Northern border. They can use all the help you get.\\\\n    With that, I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \\\\nMaryland is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Director, thank you for \\\\ntoday. I greatly appreciate your candor. I know it&#x27;s highly \\\\nunusual to go into this level of detail during an active \\\\ninvestigation.\\\\n    It&#x27;s a special and unique circumstance given the nature of \\\\nwhat happened that day. I&#x27;ll ask my colleagues that we are not \\\\ntry and take advantage of this and other circumstances.\\\\n    We need to be careful about pressuring our investigators to \\\\ndisclose information in the middle of an investigation in a \\\\ncasual or a routine way. Thank you for what you&#x27;ve done here \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    I do want to mention this too, like Congressman Correa, I \\\\nwent up to Butler with Homeland Security Committee and had a \\\\nchance to meet with a number of the people there, including \\\\npeople who were there at the rally.\\\\n    Several of them were elected officials. In fact, one of \\\\nthem that spoke with me a lot, was sitting directly behind Mr. \\\\nTrump when he was shot. She had videos that she had taken, and \\\\nshe would love to share it with you all.\\\\n    She mentioned a couple of things too, that I hope you all \\\\nwill have a chance to have conversations about. I know some of \\\\nit is going to be in the Secret Service lane and some is going \\\\nto be in the FBI lane.\\\\n    One of the things she talked about was the fact that the \\\\nday before the shooting, she and other officials in the town, \\\\nand people who just wanted to prepare the stage, showed up and \\\\nstarted working on putting the bunting up and decorating it.\\\\n    The point she noted was that none of them had been vetted. \\\\nThere was nobody there to keep an eye on them and make sure \\\\nthat everything that was being done was appropriate.\\\\n    She actually thought this in the context of hearing that a \\\\ngun was found, or a gun was perhaps hidden at the site before \\\\nthe shooter was able to get it and use it. I don&#x27;t know those \\\\ndetails.\\\\n    Those were some of the things that came up that day. She \\\\nalso mentioned that there was sort of the outer parameter.\\\\n    So, you had a parameter around the stage that the Secret \\\\nService had set up. Beyond that, you had a field. Then, you had \\\\nthe building where the company was, and the shooter got on the \\\\nroof.\\\\n    Apparently, there was sort of a second level of a parameter \\\\nthere that wasn&#x27;t particularly restricted from an access \\\\nstandpoint, as with the street, it was just beyond that.\\\\n    So, she raised, and another elected official raised as \\\\nwell, issues about security that may actually kind of get into \\\\nwhat you&#x27;re talking about. Where the ladder was there. How the \\\\nguy got on the roof. There were all sorts of issues with \\\\nrespect to that.\\\\n    There were a lot of people, as you said, that had video \\\\ntapes. I talked to three that were showing me videos while I \\\\nwas standing out there in the grounds.\\\\n    I have a couple of questions to ask of you briefly. \\\\nApparently, there was no Secret Service recordation of \\\\ncommunications during that day. There&#x27;s no radio runs, we call \\\\nthem. There&#x27;s no tapes.\\\\n    Do you know if there are any recorded conversations among \\\\nlaw enforcement from that day?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know the details of that. I believe, \\\\nthere may be some. I don&#x27;t have it in front of me exactly what \\\\nwe&#x27;ve seen or heard.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. OK. Then, with respect to email communications. \\\\nThere were a lot of issues about--because my personal, if you \\\\nhave not gone to the site, was that they shouldn&#x27;t, they just \\\\nshouldn&#x27;t have had the rally there. It should not have been \\\\npermitted.\\\\n    I thought there were, there&#x27;s too many roofs. He picked \\\\none, but there was like a half dozen others that he could have \\\\npicked on the other side of the field.\\\\n    As Eli Crane, a Congressman who was a sniper for the U.S. \\\\nmilitary, said, ``there was a water tower that actually would \\\\nhave been a better site.&#x27;&#x27; Probably that Secret Service should \\\\nhave used but could have been used as well.\\\\n    The lead up to that decision, and Congressman Correa raised \\\\nthis, ``who made this decision about how to pick the site?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Apparently, there was some back and forth between local law \\\\nenforcement, Secret Service, and the campaign. I was kind of \\\\ncurious as to whether that&#x27;s something that your investigation \\\\nis going into or not?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, that primarily falls within the scope of the \\\\nother, the two other reviews. That is the inspectors, the DHS \\\\nInspector General review, and the outside panel, independent \\\\npanel that&#x27;s been announced.\\\\n    Certainly, we are interviewing law enforcement personnel. \\\\nThe security preparations, the adequacy of the security \\\\npreparations--\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. That&#x27;s the other lane.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That&#x27;s the other lane.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. All right. I&#x27;ve only got 15 seconds left. Quick \\\\nquestion for you with probably not a quick answer. This \\\\nscenario is kind of the worst-case scenario from a couple of \\\\nstandpoints.\\\\n    You&#x27;ve got a lone wolf shooter with no red flags that we&#x27;ve \\\\nheard of so far. Nobody should have known that this was coming. \\\\nHe didn&#x27;t have a criminal record or that sort of thing. Easy \\\\naccess to an assault weapon.\\\\n    I had a discussion like this with Congressman Roy and \\\\nCongressman Bishop several months ago. What is it we can do to \\\\ntry and preempt those kinds of scenarios?\\\\n    We&#x27;ve got gun violence all over the country, including in \\\\nmy district. This is one example, but this scenario is the \\\\nworst possible that I can think of from the standpoint of no \\\\nintervention prevention efforts that can be put in place to try \\\\nand address it.\\\\n    I&#x27;m kind of curious if you have any thoughts to the \\\\ncontrary on that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know if I have any magic solution to the \\\\nproblem. I certainly don&#x27;t want to be proposing legislative \\\\nideas. That&#x27;s not really my role.\\\\n    Certainly, dangerous weapons, especially high-powered \\\\nweapons in the hands of the wrong person, represent a real \\\\nconcern for law enforcement. Including to law enforcement \\\\nsometimes as the victims, as we saw very tragically down near \\\\nMiami, with two of our agents killed.\\\\n    That&#x27;s probably all I can say about that. I do, while we&#x27;re \\\\non the subject of firearms, Mr. Chair, I have an answer to \\\\nCongresswoman Dean&#x27;s question.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Go ahead.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I might as well do it now.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Go right ahead.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Which is probably the purchase of the firearm. \\\\nI&#x27;m told that the father purchased the firearm in 2013. So, \\\\nquite a while ago. Then, he sold it to his son in October 2023. \\\\nThank you.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back. Thank you, \\\\nMr. Director, for your great work.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. I&#x27;d ask unanimous consent that we enter into \\\\nthe record, a statement from Representative Kelly and some \\\\nquestions for the Bureau.\\\\n    Representative Kelly represents Butler, actually, that&#x27;s \\\\nhis hometown. Without objection, those will be entered into the \\\\nrecord and we&#x27;ll make sure you get those Director.\\\\n    The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Before I begin, and \\\\nthis is not directly with you, actually. I just wanted to \\\\nstraighten something out.\\\\n    I know my colleagues, the gentlemen and the gentleladies \\\\nfrom Georgia, Washington, California, and Pennsylvania, you all \\\\nmentioned Project 2025. Well, I don&#x27;t know how they expect you \\\\nto know about that, No. 1. I&#x27;m pretty damn involved. I don&#x27;t \\\\nreally know a whole lot about it.\\\\n    President Trump has made it clear, and we&#x27;re going to say \\\\nit again, we&#x27;ll say it over and over again, that there are some \\\\nof the things he disagreed with, some of the things he agreed \\\\nwith that he wasn&#x27;t that familiar with. It was from The \\\\nHeritage Foundation.\\\\n    That was just raw politics to be honest with you. It was \\\\njust because 2025 has some things in it, that they believe, \\\\nthat are really going to offend American people, and it very \\\\nwell may. So, they want to pin it on the Presidential \\\\nCandidate.\\\\n    He didn&#x27;t author it. He didn&#x27;t condone it. He didn&#x27;t put \\\\nhis seal of approval on it. It&#x27;s getting old. It really is. We \\\\ndo this sort of thing.\\\\n    Just like in this Committee, when everything goes wrong, \\\\nanything, somehow Donald Trump&#x27;s name has to be brought into \\\\nit. It gets tiring. It&#x27;s politics over reality.\\\\n    The second thing about picking the site, I was intimately \\\\ninvolved in the Wildwood rally, the biggest rally President \\\\nTrump&#x27;s ever had. The biggest political rally in the State of \\\\nNew Jersey.\\\\n    I had spoken to the President about it. He wanted to do it \\\\non the beach, because we had over 100 thousand people. Let me \\\\ntell you, we had everybody out there, because they were \\\\nconcerned, the Secret Service, the local police, the country \\\\npolice, and just about every entity could be.\\\\n    So, they had behind it was that iconic setting. They had \\\\nthe ferris wheel on the pier, and all the stuff. They had \\\\nagents up in there.\\\\n    They had agents in the ocean, in the water, and in boats. \\\\nThey had people coordinating, working with each other and \\\\ntalking with each other, because they knew it was a risk.\\\\n    So, we chose a site that was difficult. The President did, \\\\nand I thought it was a great site. Nevertheless, the law \\\\nenforcement responded properly.\\\\n    Something went wrong here. You can&#x27;t blame this on Donald \\\\nTrump as well. The site was chosen. It&#x27;s the responsibility of \\\\nthose who serve in law enforcement to make sure that he was \\\\nsafe, period. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find out why.\\\\n    On another tangent here, I&#x27;ve got to wonder how many \\\\nqualified people were passed for Director Cheatle to get her 30 \\\\npercent quota. That&#x27;s a lousy way to run an agency, especially \\\\nwhen it&#x27;s dealing with law enforcement, to say, we&#x27;ve got to \\\\nhave 30 percent of anything.\\\\n    I worry about these practices, because it&#x27;s policy over \\\\nprotection. Director Wray, I know that some things were left to \\\\nyou. I understand that. One of your early acts on the Biden \\\\nPresidency was hiring the FBI&#x27;s very first Chief Diversity \\\\nOfficer.\\\\n    Since that time and even before your time, but--and you&#x27;re \\\\ngoing to disagree with me. Respectfully, I&#x27;m going to disagree \\\\nwith you. Recruitment standards under your lead have resulted \\\\nin deterioration in many areas including physical fitness, \\\\nillicit drug use, financial irregularities, mental health \\\\nissues, full time work experience, and integrity.\\\\n    I know you dismissed them, but, in October 2023, they are a \\\\nprestigious group of retired FBI Special Agents and Analysts, \\\\nboth, expressed concern regarding the FBI&#x27;s willingness to \\\\nrecruit agents that quote, I&#x27;m not saying this, they said it, \\\\nnot me,\\\\n\\\\n        Can&#x27;t even pass the new relaxed standards for fitness, who are \\\\n        illiterate in some cases, and need lessons, educational \\\\n        lessons, don&#x27;t want to work weekends or after hours . . .\\\\n\\\\nTheir words,\\\\n\\\\n         . . . and have serious disabilities or mental health issues, \\\\n        which is not the place for them.\\\\n\\\\nMost of your agents are great people. I love them. I love them \\\\nfor what they do. I&#x27;m not criticizing most. These new \\\\nstandards, don&#x27;t you think this is a hindrance and reduces the \\\\nmorale of the vast majority of good people that you have in the \\\\nFBI?\\\\n    I ask you for a quick answer because I have a few other \\\\nthings.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I respect our retired agents. Many of them \\\\ncome to our graduations now. I can tell you emphatically that \\\\nthey are mistake--those who think that we have lowered our \\\\nstandards, whether it&#x27;s on physical fitness or anything else, \\\\nare mistaken.\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. You can prove that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. The facts back me up on that.\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. That the standards are the same today as they \\\\nwere a decade ago?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again--\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. They&#x27;ve changed in some ways that are \\\\nappropriate.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, in fact, the physical fitness standards, it \\\\ndepends on how far back you go, but the physical fitness \\\\nstandards that our current graduates have to have to graduate \\\\nfrom Quantico, actually exceed some of the physical fitness \\\\nstandards that were in place, if you go back far enough, with \\\\nsome of our retirees.\\\\n    What I would tell you, part of the reason there&#x27;s \\\\nconfusion, and again, I accept that these folks are raising \\\\ntheir concerns in good faith, but we have actually access to \\\\nthe facts.\\\\n    Part of the reason there&#x27;s confusion, just take the \\\\nphysical fitness thing as an example, is that before, you had \\\\nto pass the physical fitness test before you showed up to \\\\nQuantico.\\\\n    Now, you have to pass it to get a badge at Quantico. The \\\\nstandard hasn&#x27;t changed. You still have to pass the same test, \\\\nthe same 12-point standard, et cetera, all that stuff applies.\\\\n    The only difference is you can pass it while you&#x27;re at \\\\nQuantico. If you don&#x27;t pass that same test that&#x27;s been in place \\\\nfor a long time now, you don&#x27;t get a badge.\\\\n    We will dismiss people from Quantico, and we do, who don&#x27;t \\\\npass that test.\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. Director, I have to wrap this up and I \\\\nappreciate that. If you could get us information that \\\\nsubstantiates what you say, that should be easy enough to do, \\\\nfor the whole Committee, I would appreciate it.\\\\n    Feelings in this Administration are more important than \\\\nfunctionality. It&#x27;s resulted in a border crisis. We don&#x27;t have \\\\ntime to talk about that. You&#x27;ve spoken out about it. I \\\\nappreciate that you&#x27;ve spoken out about it.\\\\n    It&#x27;s also resulted in shortages in our Nation&#x27;s law \\\\nenforcement and our military. It makes us less safe.\\\\n    So, I look forward to seeing those statistics and that \\\\nproof, because I have people talking in my ear that tell me \\\\notherwise. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \\\\nAlabama is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Director Wray, I \\\\nappreciate you being here today. I certainly appreciate your \\\\nforthcomingness and giving us information that the American \\\\npeople want.\\\\n    To me it&#x27;s--you have a very difficult job right now. In the \\\\npast, and under Comey, certainly, the Russian collusion \\\\nnarrative got out pretty heavily.\\\\n    That came out of the FBI with the FISA warrants and that \\\\nsort of stuff, spying on General Flynn. Then, the laptop issue, \\\\nthe Hunter Biden laptop issue, which the FBI actually had in \\\\ntheir possession.\\\\n    So, I have 800 thousand people thereabouts that I \\\\nrepresent. Our job is to restore trust. So, in a lot of the \\\\nhearings we&#x27;ve had this week they&#x27;ve said, well, the FBI is \\\\ninvestigating that.\\\\n    Every answer was, the FBI is investigating this. So, in \\\\nsome ways it kind of landed in your lap. I appreciate you being \\\\nhere.\\\\n    It&#x27;s just, for me, the question of how does a 20 year old, \\\\nacting alone, get a long gun, a range finder, we know he bought \\\\na ladder. I guess he reconned the area and realized he didn&#x27;t \\\\nneed the ladder to get on top of the building, so he left it at \\\\nthe house, get on a roof within 150 yards of one of the most \\\\nfamous people in the world, I guess, now, and a former \\\\nPresident, how does that happen?\\\\n    How do we restore trust in the American people if the FBI \\\\nand the DHS, who is under Mayorkas&#x27; directorate now, how do we \\\\nverify and get trust back to the American people that these \\\\nagencies are really working to protect the President?\\\\n    I&#x27;m not trying to place blame specifically. I never thought \\\\nthat we&#x27;d raid his house. I never dreamed that they&#x27;d raid a \\\\nformer President&#x27;s house.\\\\n    I certainly never imagined that they would actually indict \\\\nhim. I felt, well, they&#x27;ll never find him guilty. Now, he&#x27;s had \\\\na threat on his life.\\\\n    So, how do we restore trust in the government of this \\\\ncountry and the agencies that are here, that we pay and provide \\\\n$3 billion a year to the Secret Service to protect some of the \\\\nleading political candidates in America?\\\\n    That&#x27;s a lot. I&#x27;m sorry. That&#x27;s a lot of questions. I&#x27;m \\\\ngoing to give you a little room to talk.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Right. No, no, listen, obviously you included a \\\\nlot, as you said, in your question. As you might imagine, I \\\\ndisagree fairly strongly with a number of parts of it.\\\\n    Sensitive to the time, I guess what I would say this, I can \\\\nspeak to my approach to running the FBI. Again, the FBI was not \\\\ninvolved in the physical security of the rally. We come in as \\\\nthe investigators afterwards. As I&#x27;ve said before, our \\\\ninvestigation is an investigation of the shooter and his \\\\nattack.\\\\n    There are separate investigations, the Inspector General at \\\\nDHS, and this outside independent panel that&#x27;s been announced, \\\\nthey will be looking at the Secret Services&#x27; performance. Those \\\\nwill be important to trust and confidence, if you will, in \\\\nSecret Service.\\\\n    From the FBI perspective, we can&#x27;t promise that everybody \\\\nis going to like the results of what we do. Right? What we can \\\\npromise is that we&#x27;re going to do our best to do the work in \\\\nthe right way. That&#x27;s all we can do.\\\\n    So, I keep telling our folks every day, on this and on \\\\neverything else, our focus has to be, we&#x27;ve got to do the work \\\\nin the right way. We&#x27;ve got to make sure we do the work in the \\\\nright way.\\\\n    Then, no matter who likes it, because everything we do, \\\\nsomebody doesn&#x27;t like it.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. It&#x27;s a credibility issue at this point. Do the \\\\nAmerican people trust what the FBI and the DOJ is going to tell \\\\nthem?\\\\n    That&#x27;s the thing with this, when I was early on, and I&#x27;ve \\\\nonly been here about 3\\\\\\\\1/2\\\\\\\\-4 years now, but the American \\\\npeople fear the weaponization of government. So, now, we have \\\\nthis issue.\\\\n    Tucker Carlson asked the President, he said, ``Are you \\\\nafraid they&#x27;ll kill you?&#x27;&#x27; I remember that interview and I \\\\nthought, wow, I can&#x27;t believe he went there, but here we are.\\\\n    So, as we work through this process, I think, it&#x27;s so \\\\nimportant. The Chair hit on this, is the audio of the shooter, \\\\nyou&#x27;ve interviewed the sniper, the Secret Service sniper that \\\\ntook out the target. Was he waiting for a green light? What was \\\\ngoing on? Why did Mr. Crooks have a chance to get off eight \\\\nrounds? We knew he was on the rooftop, I don&#x27;t know for how \\\\nlong.\\\\n    We know he was a marked target. So, was he trying to get \\\\nthe green light? Was somebody not giving it to him?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, again, the performance, the adequacy of the \\\\nperformance of Secret Service will be the subject of the \\\\nInspector General investigation and this outside independent \\\\npanel.\\\\n    What I can tell you, and I&#x27;m glad you asked the question, \\\\nbecause this goes to something that was part of an earlier \\\\nexchange, the first time that anybody from law enforcement saw \\\\nthe subject on the roof, was a few minutes before the shooting.\\\\n    Not with a gun. They didn&#x27;t, at that point they didn&#x27;t \\\\nknow--\\\\n    Mr. Moore. Right. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Local law enforcement, a few minutes before, saw \\\\nhim on the roof and started radioing it in.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. Did he have a backpack going up the roof? Did \\\\nthey--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Nobody has, we haven&#x27;t found anybody yet who saw \\\\nhim climbing up the roof.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. The reason we, the reason why I&#x27;ve talked about \\\\nhow we think he got on the roof, is that&#x27;s based on forensic, \\\\nour evidence response to and forensic analysis that we&#x27;re \\\\nwithout getting into all the details, footprints and things \\\\nlike that we can fingerprints, et cetera, that we can see how \\\\nhe got on.\\\\n    We don&#x27;t have an eyewitness at the moment who saw him \\\\nclimbing up. So, a few minutes before the shooting, local law \\\\nenforcement saw him on the roof. Again, no weapon identified at \\\\nthat point.\\\\n    A few seconds before the shooting, is when the law \\\\nenforcement officer that I&#x27;ve talked about already, is the one \\\\nthat was assisted by another officer, who saw on the roof, saw \\\\nthe shooter in a prone shooting position with the gun turn--\\\\n    Mr. Moore. How long did that happen before?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That sighting is the first time to my knowledge, \\\\nthe first time anybody from law enforcement saw him with a \\\\nweapon, that is seconds before he shot at President Trump.\\\\n    Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. So, did the counter-sniper not see the bad \\\\nguy, the shooter until after he fired a shot?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Until after the subject fired a shot?\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Until after the shooter.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, I don&#x27;t know the answer to that. It&#x27;s \\\\npossible we&#x27;ve already determined that. I just, as I sit here \\\\nright now, I don&#x27;t have that. I can, yes.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. That&#x27;s the logical next question with where \\\\nthe gentleman from Alabama&#x27;s question was going.\\\\n    The gentleman from California is recognized for five \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. Director Wray, to the best of your \\\\nunderstanding, how close did the assassin&#x27;s bullet come to \\\\nkilling President Trump?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. My understanding is that either it or some \\\\nshrapnel is what grazed his ear. So, I don&#x27;t know that I have \\\\nthe actual distance.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. Very, very close though?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. What&#x27;s that?\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. Very, very close you would agree?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. Is this the biggest security failure that you&#x27;ve \\\\nseen in your career?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, certainly, Director, former Director \\\\nCheatle has already acknowledged that this was a significant, \\\\nat the very least a significant operational failure. I forgot \\\\nher exact words.\\\\n    I will defer on that. It speaks for itself.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. Well, we really haven&#x27;t seen anything like this \\\\nin at least decades in this country, right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. The attempted assassination of a President, \\\\ncurrent or former, is an historic event.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. Was this a sophisticated plot that Thomas Crooks \\\\ncarried out?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, it probably depends on your definition of \\\\nsophisticated, right? So, on the one hand he&#x27;s a 20-year-old, \\\\nit seems, from what we&#x27;ve seen so far, a loner without a lot of \\\\nelaborate criminal--without any criminal history or anything \\\\nlike that.\\\\n    On the other hand, he did clearly do some level of planning \\\\nand recon.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. When did the planning start to the best of your \\\\nknowledge?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. What&#x27;s that?\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. When did the planning start?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we&#x27;re still drilling into that. We know, we \\\\nassess that on July 6th--\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. So, a week in advance.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. For example, it seems to be that, he seems to \\\\nbecome very focused on it. Because that&#x27;s when, as I&#x27;ve \\\\ntestified here today, that&#x27;s when it, as the laptop that we&#x27;ve \\\\ntied to him has the Google search, ``how far away was Oswald \\\\nfrom Kennedy?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. That seems like an indication of a total \\\\namateur, right? Someone who&#x27;s searching for that and he&#x27;s doing \\\\nit a week in advance?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Again, I don&#x27;t want to characterize him. I, \\\\nfrankly, don&#x27;t want to give him the credit of characterizing \\\\nhim as amateur or a professional.\\\\n    What I will say is that there are some things he did that \\\\ninvolve a certain amount of planning and preparation. On the \\\\nother hand, if you&#x27;re telling me, do I think this is the most \\\\nsophisticated ever, of course not.\\\\n    We deal with much more sophisticated adversaries all the \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. You probably prepare for much more sophisticated \\\\nplans to target high-level officials.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;m sorry, could you repeat?\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. You probably prepare for more sophisticated \\\\nplans to target high-level officials, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, we don&#x27;t do physical security, but, yes. \\\\nObviously, we&#x27;re investigating much more sophisticated attacks \\\\nall the time.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. How about the encrypted applications on his \\\\nphone? Were those there for a while?\\\\n    Did he download them in the days or weeks leading up to the \\\\nassassination attempt?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t have the answer to that sitting here \\\\nright now. It may vary from platform to platform, because he \\\\nhad a number of encrypted messaging apps on it.\\\\n    Again, as I&#x27;ve said, we&#x27;re trying to get access to that \\\\ncontent. That&#x27;s important. It&#x27;s important for everybody on this \\\\nCommittee to understand that this is a real problem for law \\\\nenforcement.\\\\n    That these companies, let&#x27;s be clear here, these companies \\\\nare designing their platforms in a way to, no matter how \\\\nheinous the crime, no matter how rock solid the legal process \\\\nto have access--\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. I&#x27;m sorry to interrupt. I&#x27;m running out of time, \\\\nbut I want to get--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. To the next question. At this moment, are you \\\\nconfident that high-level protectees, Presidents, former \\\\nPresidents, are well protected?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That&#x27;s not really for me to say. I have a lot of \\\\nrespect for the men and women of the Secret Service who provide \\\\nprotection, just as I do for their counterparts at other \\\\nagencies.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. You can&#x27;t say one way or the other, your \\\\nassessment as Director of the FBI, whether the President is \\\\nsafe?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;m not an expert on protective details and \\\\nphysical security. What I would tell you is that we have a very \\\\nrobust system for sharing threat information with those \\\\nagencies. In my experience, the men and women of the Secret \\\\nService are professionals who are hard-working, who are \\\\nliterally willing to take a bullet for their protectee.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. You mentioned a thwarted assassination attempt \\\\nagainst former President Bush. Are there any other thwarted \\\\nassassination attempts against current or former Presidents \\\\nthat you could discuss?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Not that immediately comes to mind. I&#x27;d have to \\\\ngo back and think about that. Obviously, we&#x27;ve been around for \\\\na while. Current and former Presidents are high-profile targets \\\\nwho are attractive to all kinds of bad guys.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. There&#x27;s also been reports that the shooter&#x27;s \\\\nparents called local law enforcement to say he was missing on \\\\nthe day of the shooting. Is that correct?\\\\n    If so, is that something that you would see as sort of a \\\\nnatural thing for them to do? It seems like a 20-year-old who&#x27;s \\\\nbeen missing for three hours, maybe his parents don&#x27;t, first \\\\nthing they do, call the police.\\\\n    What was going on with that situation?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, my recollection, I don&#x27;t have this in front \\\\nof me. My recollection is that they did call, concerned that he \\\\nwas missing.\\\\n    My recollection though, is that they didn&#x27;t call until, \\\\nthis was after the event.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. I see.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I&#x27;m not certain of that. So, I want to hedge on \\\\nthat slightly, because I have to get back to you to confirm \\\\nthat.\\\\n    I believe that part of the issue was that when he last saw \\\\nhis father, he indicated to his father that he was going to \\\\nshoot at the range. Then, of course, he didn&#x27;t go to the range. \\\\nHe didn&#x27;t come back from that. So, that may have added to the \\\\nlevel of concern.\\\\n    Mr. Kiley. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentlelady \\\\nfrom Wyoming is recognized.\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Director Wray, I am \\\\ngoing to go a little bit different route with my questioning.\\\\n    In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in \\\\nDecember of last year, you stated that the FBI is ``especially \\\\nconcerned about the possibility of Hamas supporters engaging in \\\\nviolence on the group&#x27;s behalf&#x27;&#x27; and that the threat from a \\\\n``terrorist organization who may exploit the attacks on Israel \\\\nas a tool to mobilize their followers around the world.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    We have seen a lot of conduct today that I think is \\\\nconcerning to many people in terms of Hamas terrorists and \\\\ntheir sympathizers. Reports have surfaced alleging that many of \\\\nthe groups intimidating and violating the civil rights of \\\\nJewish American students, like the Students for Justice for \\\\nPalestine, received guidance and financial support from \\\\nAmerican Muslims for Palestine and that AMP&#x27;s directors \\\\nallegedly have links to groups which fund-raised for Hamas.\\\\n    Director Wray, is the Bureau aware of or investigating \\\\nwhether these groups violating the civil liberties of Jewish \\\\nAmericans are connected to or affiliated with Hamas or other \\\\nterrorist organizations?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, we are investigating a lot of attacks and \\\\nthreats against the Jewish community. I have been very vocal on \\\\nhow big of a concern that is. Certainly, that was already \\\\nheightened even before October 7th. Since October 7th, it went \\\\nto a whole other level. We are actively engaged with the Jewish \\\\ncommunity both locally and nationally.\\\\n    When it comes to foreign terrorist organizations and their \\\\nrole or foreign adversaries and their role, we are looking hard \\\\nto see if we can find linkage, for example, funding or things \\\\nlike that. Nothing that I can report at this time. It is \\\\nsomething that--\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. You are investigating it?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. --it is the kind of thing that we are looking \\\\nfor, absolutely, because we know that there is an interest in \\\\ntheir part to foment--\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. We are watching it in real time today.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Right, yes.\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. There are other reports that Mayor Bitar, \\\\nNational Security Council Coordinator for Intelligence and \\\\nDefense Policy and Deputy Assistant to the President, was an \\\\nactive member in Students for Justice in Palestine at \\\\nGeorgetown University, which is one of the groups alleged to \\\\nhave ties to Hamas.\\\\n    Is the Bureau investigating whether the Biden-Harris \\\\nAdministration is compromised by pro-Hamas groups and \\\\norganizations?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, we are having quite a number of \\\\nHamas-related investigations. I can&#x27;t--\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. I am asking specifically--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes, I can&#x27;t--\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. --about whether you are investigating whether \\\\nthe Biden-Harris Administration has been compromised by pro-\\\\nHamas groups.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. There is nothing along those lines that I can \\\\nthink of to report.\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. I also want to talk to you a bit about the \\\\nFBI&#x27;s investigation and involvement with the Russia collusion \\\\nhoax. The FBI was involved with that because of its potential \\\\nrelationship to election interference. Is that correct? The \\\\nFBI&#x27;s involvement in investigating the Russia collusion hoax \\\\nthat was because there was concern about election interference, \\\\nis that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, the FBI was involved and staffed as \\\\ninvestigators in the Special Counsel Mueller investigation into \\\\nefforts by the Russian Government to influence and interfere.\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. With the election, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. All right. So, is the FBI investigating what \\\\njust happened with Joe Biden being forced out of the race after \\\\nwinning the Democrat primary as election interference? Is the \\\\nFBI investigating that right now?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not aware of any investigation along those \\\\nlines.\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. It has happened just in the last couple of \\\\nweeks.\\\\n    OK. Director Wray, it was reported in March that the FBI&#x27;s \\\\nForeign Influence Task Force resumed communication with social \\\\nmedia companies. An FBI spokesman has stated that,\\\\n\\\\n        In coordination with the Department of Justice, the FBI \\\\n        recently implemented procedures to facilitate sharing \\\\n        information about foreign malign influences with social media \\\\n        companies in a way that reinforces that private companies are \\\\n        free to decide on their own whether and how to take action on \\\\n        the information.\\\\n\\\\n    Director Wray, what specifically is the FBI doing to \\\\nreinforce that such decisions are in fact for the private \\\\ncompanies to make and not the Administration?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I think the best way to summarize it is that \\\\nthe guidance takes all kinds of additional steps to underscore \\\\nthat the FBI has no interest in participating in any way \\\\nwhatsoever in the companies&#x27; decisionmaking and that companies \\\\nare completely free to take any actions on their own.\\\\n    That we are simply passing information on to them for them \\\\nto do whatever it is they want to do independently, consistent \\\\nwith, I should say, I very much appreciate the Supreme Court&#x27;s \\\\nfinding that no evidence that the FBI coerced platforms to take \\\\ncontent down.\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. Well, I don&#x27;t believe that is what the Supreme \\\\nCourt found. What the Supreme Court found was that the parties \\\\ninvolved didn&#x27;t have standing. I think there is a whole body of \\\\nevidence and legal analysis demonstrating that in fact this \\\\nAdministration was violating the First Amendment rights of \\\\nfolks through social media companies.\\\\n    I am just going to ask one final very quick question. If \\\\nthe FBI was involved in the removal or restriction of speech of \\\\nAmericans, do you agree that this would be a violation of the \\\\nFirst Amendment?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, I am not going to engage in hypo-\\\\ntheticals. My understanding and my strong view from everything \\\\nI have seen is that we did not violate the First Amendment.\\\\n    Ms. Hageman. OK.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentlelady yields back. The gentleman \\\\nfrom Texas is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Gooden. Thank you, Director. I have just got two easy \\\\nquestions for you. In February, Donald Trump, Jr., received a \\\\nletter containing a white suspicious powder that read, ``Lee \\\\nHarvey Oswald&#x27;s grandson must complete his contract.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    The United States Secret Service and the FBI said they \\\\nwould investigate the matter, and five months later no more \\\\ninformation has been released. I have also visited with Mr. \\\\nTrump, and he has not received any information either. Why is \\\\nthat?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, as I sit here right now, I am not familiar \\\\nwith the specific investigation, but I do know that we have had \\\\nunfortunately quite a few investigations of threatening \\\\nmailings and white powder letters and things like that.\\\\n    So, I am happy to drill into it and have us circle back to \\\\nyou and see if there is more information we can share about it.\\\\n    Mr. Gooden. Thank you. Would you maybe circle back to Mr. \\\\nTrump and Donald, Jr. I think they would like an update as \\\\nwell.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. All right. Sure. Let me--again, like I said, I am \\\\nnot familiar with the specifics, but I am happy to have us look \\\\ninto it and get back to whoever we need to get back to.\\\\n    Mr. Gooden. Thank you. The next question, the Pittsburgh \\\\nField Office is now handling the assassination attempt \\\\ninvestigation, is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, there are several--the Pittsburgh Field \\\\nOffice is the lead office. We obviously have lots of--I think \\\\nit is about half, maybe over half, of the FBI&#x27;s field offices \\\\nare working on this, including almost every headquarters \\\\ndivision. So, we have lots and lots and lots, several hundreds \\\\nof employees working on it, but yes.\\\\n    Mr. Gooden. All right. Pittsburgh is the lead. OK. This is \\\\nthe same office that botched the Hunter Biden laptop case. \\\\nThey, in my view, my constituents, and many Americans displayed \\\\na clear reluctance, quote, ``reluctance to really do any \\\\ntasking&#x27;&#x27; and ``effectively failing to investigate,&#x27;&#x27; according \\\\nto the U.S. Attorney on the case.\\\\n    My question is how can we trust this office and why does it \\\\nkeep reappearing in critical election related investigations or \\\\nis that just dumb luck?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I want to be a little bit careful in what I \\\\ncan say here because some of what you are talking about relates \\\\nto an ongoing investigation being led by the Special Counsel, \\\\nMr. Weiss, but what I can tell you is that the Pittsburgh Field \\\\nOffice&#x27;s involvement in the matter you are talking about was \\\\nthe choice by the\\\\nAttorney General, Attorney General Barr, to have the U.S. \\\\nAttorney and the FBI Field Office in Pittsburgh handle that \\\\nparticular matter.\\\\n    As to your summary or characterization of what U.S. \\\\nAttorney, now former U.S. Attorney Brady actually said, I would \\\\nhave to see the whole context. I am not quite sure that&#x27;s what \\\\nhe said. As to your overall question about confidence, what I \\\\nwould tell is we have--that is the point I am trying to make \\\\nabout the sheer breadth of our investigation.\\\\n    Yes, the Pittsburgh Field Office is the office on the \\\\nground. That is where the attempted assassination happened. We \\\\nare using the full might of the FBI, criminal and national \\\\nsecurity. That is why I am pointing out that multiple field \\\\noffices, over half of our field offices, almost every \\\\nheadquarters division, several hundreds of employees. These are \\\\npeople who are working around the clock to deal with this \\\\nhistoric attack.\\\\n    I have the utmost confidence in those hundreds of \\\\nemployees, agents, analysts, professional staff, and the \\\\nAmerican people should, too.\\\\n    Mr. Gooden. I yield to Mr. Jordan.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. \\\\nDirector, I guess I am not clear exactly where you said there \\\\nwere eight-shell casings on the roof so eight bullets were \\\\nfired. We obviously know that Mr. Comperatore lost his life, \\\\ntwo other rally goers were injured, seriously injured, and then \\\\nthe one that hit President Trump.\\\\n    Does that account for--were some of these individuals hit \\\\nmultiple times? Where did all eight bullets go, I guess, is my \\\\nquestion?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t have that in front of me. I am happy to \\\\ncircle back and get that to you. That is assuming we have that \\\\ninformation. As I said, I think with respect to former \\\\nPresident Trump, there is some question about whether or not it \\\\nis a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear. So, it is \\\\nconceivable.\\\\n    As I sit here right now, I don&#x27;t know whether that bullet, \\\\nin addition to causing the grazing, could have also landed \\\\nsomewhere else. I believe we have accounted for all of the \\\\nshots and the cartridges. So, let us get--\\\\n    Chair Jordan. It is my understanding that the very first \\\\none was the one that hit the President. Is that the very first \\\\nshot or is that not accurate?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. As I sit here right now, I don&#x27;t know the answer \\\\nto that. I believe we know the answer to that. I just don&#x27;t \\\\nhave it in front of me.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK. Is there any chance this--it seems to me \\\\nthat this bad guy, this shooter, was focused on President \\\\nTrump. You indicated that he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition, \\\\nI believe, earlier that day.\\\\n    Do you have any indication thus far in your investigation \\\\nthat in addition to going after and trying to assassinate the \\\\nformer President, he was also looking to do a lot more damage \\\\nto other individuals?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. That&#x27;s a hard question to answer. What I would \\\\nsay is I agree with you that his preparatory activity, what we \\\\nhave seen so far, the limited information that has been \\\\nrelevant and interesting about his preparatory activity, does \\\\nseem to be that he had settled on former President Trump as a \\\\ntarget, and this rally as his moment to try to take a shot.\\\\n    In addition to the 50 rounds, of course, you have the issue \\\\nof these explosive devices.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, what else he may have had in mind is \\\\nsomething that I think is very much of an open question.\\\\n    On the one hand, you have these explosive devices, \\\\nincluding the one still back at his home that wasn&#x27;t in quite \\\\nthe same stage as the one in the vehicle--the ones in the \\\\nvehicle. He clearly had those explosive devices for some \\\\nreason. So, we are trying to figure that out.\\\\n    As I have said before, sometimes in these kinds of \\\\nsituations you find like a manifesto or something like that.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. It is frustrating to us, and I am sure \\\\nfrustrating to you and the American people, that we haven&#x27;t \\\\nfound anything quite like that.\\\\n    We would love to have a road map that tells us exactly what \\\\nhe was thinking. We haven&#x27;t found that yet. It doesn&#x27;t mean we \\\\nwon&#x27;t. We are looking all over the place. We are going to leave \\\\nno stone unturned.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Thank you. The gentleman from Texas is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. Hunt. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Director, for \\\\nbeing here today. I know it has been a very long day, a busy \\\\nday on Capitol Hill. Also, I want to apologize in advance if \\\\nthere is any repetitive questions from me.\\\\n    I have to ask, given that our sitting President resigned \\\\nfrom the campaign on Sunday and the Secret Service Director \\\\nresigned yesterday, you don&#x27;t plan on resigning any time soon, \\\\ndo you, sir?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. No, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Hunt. Good. Good to go. Earlier today, you told this \\\\nCommittee that you recovered eight bullet cartridges from the \\\\nroof next to the shooter.\\\\n    Given that testimony, I have two questions for you. How \\\\nmany shots were fired at President Trump, and how many shots \\\\nwere fired in total of the entire day? I know I keep hearing \\\\neight, but were there anymore that were unaccounted for?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. The best information I have right now is eight \\\\nshots. As to the sequence, I am not sure I have that sitting \\\\nhere right now. As I said to the Chair, I am going to go back \\\\nto my team and see if we have got that nailed down yet. If we \\\\nhave, I am happy to share it with you and the rest of the \\\\nCommittee.\\\\n    Mr. Hunt. Please do, sir. Thank you very much for that.\\\\n    You also mentioned that the shooter used encrypted messages \\\\nto communicate. Specifically, do you know what apps that he was \\\\nusing to communicate? Can you confirm if he was communicating \\\\nwith any foreign nationals through the encrypted messages?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, as to the names of the apps, I don&#x27;t have \\\\nthat right here in front of me. As far as communicating with \\\\nany foreign actors, I will say two things:\\\\n\\\\n    (1)  We haven&#x27;t, as I have testified before, we have not, \\\\nat the moment at least, identified any accomplices or co-\\\\nconspirators, foreign or domestic.\\\\n    (2)  As to foreign contacts, of course, that is part of why \\\\nwe want to get access to the encrypted messages, because that \\\\nmight tell us whether he had been in contact with somebody.\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Hunt. Thank you. Let&#x27;s talk about motive. I know the \\\\nFBI has taken a lead role in investigating the assassination of \\\\nPresident Trump. Your team has searched the shooter&#x27;s phone, \\\\nconducted countless interviews, done extensive research into \\\\nhis motives. As of today, July 24, 2024, do you and your team \\\\nknow the motive of the shooter or have any idea what could have \\\\ndriven it?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, ``know&#x27;&#x27; and &#x27;&#x27;have any idea&#x27;&#x27; are two very \\\\ndifferent things.\\\\n    Mr. Hunt. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We do not know the motive. That is obviously one \\\\nof the central questions in our investigation. It has been very \\\\nfrustrating to us that a lot of the usual kind of low-hanging \\\\nfruit places that we would find that have not yielded \\\\nsignificant clues about his motive.\\\\n    Having said that, we have seen indications that he was \\\\ninterested in public figures. In the period around July 6th \\\\nleading up to July 13th, he does seem to become very focused on \\\\nthis particular rally and former President Trump. Exactly what \\\\nhis thought process was in doing that is something still very \\\\nmuch under investigation.\\\\n    Mr. Hunt. I want to make something clear to the American \\\\npeople to try to help out with motive. Could they--again, it is \\\\nnot my job to steer it, but here are some of my thoughts.\\\\n    I am not sure about motives either specifically. I can tell \\\\nyou that after the assassination attempt, people on both sides, \\\\nboth parties, need to tone down the rhetoric.\\\\n    Recently, just on Monday in fact, President Biden called \\\\ninto the Harris campaign event and said that President Trump \\\\nwas a threat to democracy.\\\\n    Just take a look behind me at these photos. This is a \\\\nmagazine cover of The New Republic from June 2024, published \\\\njust one month before the assassination attempt on President \\\\nTrump. In a Tweet explaining the cover, The New Republic said \\\\nthis:\\\\n\\\\n        Today, we, at The New Republic think we can spend this election \\\\n        year in one of two ways: We could spend it debating whether \\\\n        Trump meets the 9 or 17 points that define fascism. Or we could \\\\n        spend it saying he is damn close enough, and we better fight. \\\\n        We unreservedly choose the latter course.\\\\n\\\\n    Now, sir, I know you said that the FBI doesn&#x27;t have a clear \\\\nmotive yet, and you have explained that. In your professional \\\\nexperience as an investigator, do you think that language like \\\\nthis could radicalize someone to engage in political violence?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I certainly understand the point of the question. \\\\nWhat I would tell you is that respectfully, I don&#x27;t think it is \\\\nappropriate for me, as the FBI Director, to be characterizing \\\\nor engaging in public commentary on specific people&#x27;s rhetoric.\\\\n    That&#x27;s because it is not that I don&#x27;t understand why you \\\\nare raising the question, but I am saying that in my role, I \\\\nhave to be very careful to make sure that we speak through our \\\\nwork and we speak through our cases and our intelligence \\\\nproducts, not the FBI Director chiming in on the public square \\\\non different people&#x27;s public political commentary.\\\\n    Mr. Hunt. I understand. For the record, there was an \\\\nassassination attempt on an American President. I will be \\\\nasking these same questions even if it were President Biden.\\\\n    My message to the American people is that we need to do \\\\nbetter. I yield back the rest of my time. I thank you for being \\\\nhere, sir. I know it has been a very long day.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \\\\nSouth Carolina is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Director, for \\\\nbeing here. Actually, it is refreshing. I was in the Oversight \\\\nhearing earlier this week, and although we don&#x27;t have an idea \\\\non everything, your ability to come in here and actually give \\\\nway more than Director Cheatle ever did is somewhat refreshing. \\\\nYou saw some pretty bipartisan frustrations exhibited in that \\\\nparticular hearing. I am sure you have seen part of it.\\\\n    I want to followup on a couple lines of questions that I \\\\nhad with Director Cheatle that she actually answered, which was \\\\nremarkable.\\\\n    One she had indicated that Secret Service at the Trump \\\\nrally did not have any radio recordings. In your investigation, \\\\nis that accurate?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not sure I know the answer to that. I \\\\nbelieve we have--there may be some recordings on the local law \\\\nenforcement side. As to whether or not we have recordings on \\\\nthe Secret Service side, I would have to drill back into that.\\\\n    The reason I am--you might say, well, how the heck can you \\\\nnot know, well, we certainly have interviewed lots of Secret \\\\nService employees.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. Correct.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, what we know from the interviews versus some \\\\nother source, as I sit here right now, I don&#x27;t know.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. So, on this particular case, but in your \\\\nexperience, and again, it is a different agency, but she had \\\\nindicated, Director Cheatle had indicated, that recordings \\\\nsometimes are done from radio recordings, I guess, what happens \\\\nat a Trump rally or any other thing that they are engaged in.\\\\n    Is that your experience as well that sometimes there are \\\\naudio recordings of communications between law enforcement \\\\nofficials?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Just speaking very broadly--\\\\n    Mr. Fry. Broadly.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. --certainly, there are times when there are \\\\nrecordings. It would be hard for me to be more precise than \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. I know you can&#x27;t answer whether they were here in \\\\nthis instance or not, but what would cause recordings to not \\\\nexist for the Trump rally if, as a hypothetical, what would be \\\\nthe reason that this would happen?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am afraid I don&#x27;t know the answer to that. If \\\\nthey didn&#x27;t record, there may be situations where they just \\\\ndon&#x27;t record in the first place. Why that would be though, I am \\\\nnot sure I can answer that.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. Thank you. Let me ask you this, and this is \\\\nanother line of questioning. Director Cheatle had indicated \\\\nthat seconds before the would-be assassin fired the shot, is \\\\nroughly seconds, is when he became a person of suspicion to an \\\\nactual threat. Would you agree with that assessment from \\\\nDirector Cheatle?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, let me try it this way. I think there are \\\\nsort of three--in my mind, there are sort of three, let&#x27;s say \\\\nthree significant moments on this continuum that you are kind \\\\nof getting at.\\\\n    There is roughly an hour before the shooting when local law \\\\nenforcement observes the individual, the shooter, at that point \\\\nas somebody that was a person of concern. I forgot the exact \\\\nphrasing. That was based on seeing him with this range finder. \\\\nNo observation of a weapon, but there was something odd and off \\\\nabout him that caught local law enforcement&#x27;s attention. So, \\\\nthat is the first moment.\\\\n    Then, there is a second moment which is just minutes before \\\\nthe shooting where local law enforcement observed him on the \\\\nroof, but didn&#x27;t see a weapon is my understanding at that \\\\npoint. At that point, their level of concern, obviously, was \\\\neven higher.\\\\n    The third moment, which is that moment when local law \\\\nenforcement saw him, the officer who climbed up with the \\\\nassistance of his colleague, and saw the shooter in the prone \\\\nposition with the weapon. That is seconds before the event.\\\\n    So, the terminology I&#x27;m not sure.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. It seems to me there is an evolution of concern \\\\nover that time period.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. Correct, an escalating concern. At what point--and \\\\nthis again, I just don&#x27;t know so I&#x27;m curious. At what point is \\\\nsay the sniper who killed Mr. Crooks, at what point is he able \\\\nto fire a shot and does he have to have authorization in which \\\\nto do that?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know that I know Secret Service&#x27;s rules \\\\nof engagement in that situation. It is possible that our \\\\ninterview of the counter-sniper has uncovered that.\\\\n    Again, our focus has been--I certainly understand why you \\\\nare asking the question. Our focus has been on the shooter \\\\nhimself and his actions in the attack. These two other reviews, \\\\nthe DHS Inspector General and the outside independent panel are \\\\nboth looking at the performance of the Secret Service, which \\\\nwould, I am confident, include the question that you are \\\\ntalking about.\\\\n    Mr. Fry. Thank you, Director. I actually think from a \\\\nlegislative purpose and what this body will probably ultimately \\\\ndo, it&#x27;s of great importance that we break down barriers of \\\\ncommunication and that we allow officers to do their job \\\\nwithout so this doesn&#x27;t happen again.\\\\n    I appreciate you being here. Thank you, Director.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \\\\nOhio is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. Well once again, as Congressman Fry said, we \\\\nwant to thank you for your time and a lot more information \\\\ntoday than Monday. So, thank you for that.\\\\n    I just have a handful of questions. I would love to have \\\\njust a simple yes or no so we can get done with this.\\\\n    So, on day one, President Biden issued an Executive Order \\\\nmandating DEI programs in the Executive Branch.\\\\n    You responded by hiring FBI&#x27;s first ever Chief Diversity \\\\nOfficer. You are even on the Bureau&#x27;s website quoting, saying,\\\\n\\\\n        That diversity and inclusion of the workforce is something I \\\\n        care deeply about because the success of our efforts impacts \\\\n        our operations, our culture, and our future.\\\\n\\\\n    So, Director, just a simple yes or no. Do you still find \\\\nDEI hiring practices to be central to the FBI&#x27;s operations, \\\\ncultures, and future?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I believe that diversity is an important part--is \\\\na core value of a high-performing organization.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. Do you have any concerns that our homeland \\\\nsecurity efforts will be hampered if the FBI continues to use \\\\nDEI as a primary hiring measure?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t believe that we use DEI as a primary \\\\nhiring metric. I would say that we have not lowered our \\\\nstandards.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. Yes or no, please.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Let me--if I could finish. It is not a yes or no \\\\nquestion. We have not lowered our standards, and the facts back \\\\nthat up.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. Are you aware of a 112-page report compiled by \\\\nsenior agents and analysts which stated,\\\\n\\\\n        If the current trajectory of the FBI special agent recruitment \\\\n        and selection continues using DEI as the primary and sole \\\\n        measure, our homeland security efforts will be significant \\\\n        hampered.\\\\n\\\\nDo you know about that 112-page report?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am aware of a report from a number of anonymous \\\\nformer employees.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. Thank you. Do you agree that protecting the \\\\nformer President falls under the umbrella of Homeland Security?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, protecting the former President, the \\\\nphysical security, the protective detail on the former \\\\nPresident, is the province of the Secret Service, which is part \\\\nof the Department of Homeland Security.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. It is my understanding that historically the FBI \\\\nhad 100,000 applications for special agents on file at any \\\\ngiven time of the year.\\\\n    So, talking about supplementing recruitment, are you aware \\\\nthat in February 2024, a letter from the FBI&#x27;s Assistant \\\\nDirector for Training Division, which reported that FBI only \\\\nreceived an estimated 48,000 applications over a two-year \\\\nperiod?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know if we are comparing apples to \\\\napples. What I can tell you is that in the time that I have \\\\nbeen FBI Director, the number of Americans applying to be \\\\nspecial agents has gone up dramatically to the tune of in some \\\\ncases double or triple the pace of--\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. So, the 48,000 is wrong?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. --if I could finish, sir, if I could finish, \\\\nplease--to a rate that is higher--you would have to go back \\\\nabout a decade or so to find the number of Americans applying \\\\nto be special agents that are currently applying.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. OK. So, for the record, that 48,000 is probably \\\\nwrong then in your eyes?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t have the letter in front of \\\\nme. What I am not sure of is that we are comparing apple to \\\\napple in terms of time periods and everything else.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. In advance of the Trump shooting, United States \\\\nSecret Service Special Agent in Charge Tim Burke reportedly \\\\ntold law enforcement partners that the NATO Summit in \\\\nWashington, DC, limited his resources available to the Trump \\\\nrally.\\\\n    The Service has similar DEI hiring aims and failed their \\\\nzero-fail mission to protect President Trump. Director Cheatle \\\\nhas since stepped down. Could the hyper fixation on hitting \\\\nBiden Administration&#x27;s imposed DEI rules be causing the FBI and \\\\nthe Federal law enforcement agencies to not only miss their \\\\ncandidates, but also potential threats?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, I can&#x27;t speak to Secret Service&#x27;s hiring \\\\npractice. What I can tell you is that in my view, diversity, \\\\nlike everything else, is something that has to be done in the \\\\nright way. Just like everything, there is a right way and a \\\\nwrong way to achieve it.\\\\n    I think we can and have achieved improvements in diversity \\\\nand at the same time not lowering our standards. I think part \\\\nof the reason we have been able to do that is because of the \\\\nencouraging increase in the number of Americans applying to be \\\\nspecial agents.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. Thank you. The investigation into the planting \\\\nof pipe bombs at the RNC and DNC headquarters has been going on \\\\nfor over 3\\\\\\\\1/2\\\\\\\\ years and will soon have lasted longer than the \\\\nBiden Presidency.\\\\n    I look forward to you proving yourselves because we haven&#x27;t \\\\nreceived any update, right now, on the Trump shooting since \\\\nJuly 15th and the people really need that.\\\\n    Can the public expect a more transparent and timely \\\\ninvestigation into the attempted assassination of former \\\\nPresident Trump?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I have been testifying here all day about the \\\\ninvestigation into the attempted assassination of former \\\\nPresident Trump. We have done multiple briefings, and I have \\\\nanswered multiple questions.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. We appreciate that because like I said--\\\\n    Mr. Wray. OK. If that&#x27;s what you were asking.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. --well, it just seems like there hasn&#x27;t been a \\\\npress conference to the people to go through all the different \\\\ndetails that were already presented today.\\\\n    I will just leave you with one final question. The \\\\ngovernment is not doing their job. Do you feel as the Director \\\\nthat perhaps not only the FBI, but the Secret Service needs to \\\\nhave a complete reconstruction? Do you think it is still put \\\\ntogether the way that it could be do its job?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. The FBI that I see every single day, having \\\\nvisited all 56 of our field offices at least twice, many of \\\\nthem three times, the FBI that I see engaging with State and \\\\nlocal law enforcement from all 50 States that I hear about from \\\\nprosecutors, judges, business leaders, community leaders, and \\\\nforeign partners, is an FBI that is respected, trusted, \\\\nappreciated, and it is there for people when they need them the \\\\nmost. That is the FBI that I see. I am very proud to be a part \\\\nof them.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. Any comment on the other agencies?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not going to comment on another agencies.\\\\n    Mr. Rulli. I appreciate your time, sir. I yield back to the \\\\nChair.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. The gentleman yields back. Director, I have \\\\njust a couple quick questions, but I want to give the Ranking \\\\nMember a chance to say some remarks or questions, and then we \\\\nwill be done.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I would like to say \\\\nas somebody when I grew up watching the Untouchables. I think \\\\nEliot Ness would be proud of you. I don&#x27;t know about J. Edgar \\\\nHoover, but Eliot Ness for sure.\\\\n    Let me ask you this. In Memphis, you put Memphis and \\\\nNashville&#x27;s FBI together, and consolidated in one office. We \\\\nhave--I know you have worked with our U.S. Attorney and others \\\\nto work on the crime situation there, and it has gotten better. \\\\nIs this change in the FBI relationship there, we are not going \\\\nto have an office necessarily. Tell me how that is going to \\\\naffect Memphis.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, I want to be very clear. We are not leaving. \\\\nWe are not leaving Memphis. What we are doing is--\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Nobody should leave Memphis.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Most of the songs are about people going to \\\\nMemphis. They leave Nashville. They go to Memphis.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. We are recognizing population growth and the \\\\nthreat to the environment. We have instead taken, if you look \\\\nacross the State, instead of having two field offices in \\\\nKnoxville and Memphis, we are creating a Tennessee division \\\\nheadquartered in the middle in Nashville. We are keeping the \\\\noffices in Knoxville and Memphis.\\\\n    In fact, when it comes to Memphis specifically, not only \\\\nwill it not result in any decrease in the number of agents \\\\nthere to work, actually, strange as it might sound, it is going \\\\nto allow us to increase the number of agents who will be \\\\nassigned to the Memphis office, including to tackle things like \\\\nviolent crime, which I know is of huge concern.\\\\n    The reason for that is really, the effect of this \\\\nreorganization is, to be able to reduce administrative roles \\\\nthat will be more consolidated in the middle of Nashville. It \\\\nwill allow us to increase the operational roles, the agent \\\\nroles, the number of them in Memphis.\\\\n    So, not only are we not leaving Memphis, we are actually \\\\nincreasing our investigative presence in Memphis as part of \\\\nthis. We are going to be able to continue to collaborate \\\\nclosely with our great partners there without skipping a beat.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Thank you. That is reassuring. One of the \\\\nquestions that was asked over here was about previous \\\\nassassination attempts on the Presidents. Obviously, I know you \\\\nare a lot younger than me, did you ever watch the Untouchables?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I have watched them, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. One of the programs was on Mayor Cermak. Do you \\\\nknow Mayor Cermak?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am sorry. I couldn&#x27;t hear you.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. Mayor Cermak, do you know who he was?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I do not.\\\\n    Mr. Cohen. He was the mayor of Chicago. In February 1933, \\\\nthere was an assassination attempt on Franklin Roosevelt in \\\\nMiami, Florida. Mayor Cermak, C-E-R-M-A-K, was killed and said, \\\\n``I am glad it was me and not you.&#x27;&#x27; Allegedly, he said that. \\\\nAnyway, that was an attempt and it failed. The Untouchables \\\\nbrought it into my consciousness.\\\\n    Thank you for your work. I appreciate it very much. I \\\\nappreciate you are not looking into changing our Democratic \\\\nnominee. That is something we normally do. Thank you.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Director, I am still not clear in my mind. \\\\nWhen did the counter-snipers, the good guys, when did they \\\\nfirst get eyes on the bad guy, the would-be assassin, on the \\\\nroof of the AGR building?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I am not certain, but I will make my best effort \\\\nhere.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. I guess, I am sorry to interrupt.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Yes?\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Did they have eyes on him before the local \\\\nenforcement was looking up on the roof and engaged with the bad \\\\nguy shooter?\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I don&#x27;t know the answer to that. I will look into \\\\nthat and get to you. I believe we have the answer. I just don&#x27;t \\\\nknow that I have it. I want to make sure I answer accurately.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Because we thought from the briefings that \\\\nMr. Abbate gave us.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Abbate.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Excuse me, Abbate gave us, and the briefings \\\\nyou gave to Congress that they did. It wasn&#x27;t clear from your \\\\ntestimony. So, if you can get that answer to us that would be \\\\nhelpful.\\\\n    I want to circle back just a third time, if I could, to the \\\\nIranian threat to President Trump and some others, former \\\\nmembers of our government. The reason I want to go back there \\\\nbecause we now know that the Secret Service and Homeland \\\\nSecurity denied resources to President Trump&#x27;s detail that they \\\\nhad asked for.\\\\n    It seems to me if that all happened after you guys knew \\\\nabout the Iran threat and had briefed the Secret Service on \\\\nthat real threat that is an even bigger problem. That is why I \\\\nwas trying to get that timeline down, when you knew about it \\\\nand when you briefed the Secret Service on the Iranian&#x27;s threat \\\\nto kill President Trump.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. So, again, I really want to be careful to both be \\\\naccurate, but also not to kind of stray into any kind of \\\\nclassified information or confirm the existence of classified \\\\ninformation. So, let me see if there is a way for us to get \\\\nback to you on that question.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. I understand why you are asking. It may be easier \\\\nto answer than I think. At the moment in an open hearing, I am \\\\nnot sure if I can see the right way to do that.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. Fair enough. We will expect answers to both \\\\nthose questions. If you can get back to us, that would be \\\\ngreat.\\\\n    Finally, is there anything else you want to tell us that we \\\\ndidn&#x27;t ask? You came today and you told us some things that \\\\nweren&#x27;t even prompted by questions. I just want to make sure if \\\\nthere is anything else you want to tell us regarding July 13th, \\\\nand what you discovered, now is the time.\\\\n    Mr. Wray. Well, again, we are going to continue to engage \\\\nwith the Congress. I think we have covered a lot of the points \\\\nthat I really wanted to make sure that I got across--and just \\\\nas I am looking at my list--in one way or another through the \\\\ncourse of today&#x27;s questioning. I think we have gotten through \\\\nmost of it.\\\\n    Chair Jordan. That concludes today&#x27;s hearing. We thank our \\\\nwitness for appearing before the Committee today.\\\\n    Without objection, all Members will have five legislative \\\\ndays to submit additional written questions for the witness or \\\\nadditional materials for the record.

The Subcommittee on \\\\nCapital Markets will come to order.\\\\n    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a \\\\nrecess of the subcommittee at any time.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s hearing is entitled, ``Examining the Agenda of \\\\nRegulators, SROs, and Standards-Setters for Accounting, \\\\nAuditing.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I now recognize myself for 5 minutes to give an opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    I want to thank you all for joining us today to discuss our \\\\nfinancial regulatory landscape. It is incumbent upon this \\\\ncommittee to highlight the indispensable roles of the Public \\\\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the Financial \\\\nIndustry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Financial \\\\nAccounting Standards Board (FASB), in upholding transparency, \\\\naccountability, and stability within our markets. However, \\\\nrecent developments have raised significant concerns, \\\\nnecessitating a thorough review of their approaches and \\\\nimpacts.\\\\n    Let&#x27;s begin with the PCAOB. Recently-proposed amendments, \\\\nnotably the Noncompliance with Laws and Regulations (NOCLAR) \\\\nproposal, raise red flags regarding the potential overextension \\\\nof auditors&#x27; responsibilities. As Full Committee Chairman \\\\nMcHenry and I noted in an August letter to the PCAOB, these \\\\namendments not only divert crucial resources from the primary \\\\nfocus on auditing financial statements but may also compromise \\\\naudit quality. And the anticipated costs associated with these \\\\nchanges are staggering, potentially comparable to the Sarbanes-\\\\nOxley Act (SOX). This could lead to an alarming $18.2-billion \\\\nfee increase, a burden that would ultimately fall on everyday \\\\ninvestors. Moreover, the PCAOB&#x27;s new approach upends U.S. \\\\nauditor independence and forces them to function as law \\\\nenforcement agents.\\\\n    Now, turning to FINRA, I, and many of my colleagues are \\\\nconcerned that FINRA has strayed too far from its original \\\\npurpose. It has developed into an overzealous and \\\\nunaccountable, I am going to say quasi-governmental entity, \\\\nthat looks and acts a lot more like the SEC than the member-\\\\ndriven SRO that Congress originally established. The \\\\ncomposition of its board, primarily consisting of individuals \\\\nnot directly involved in the industry, raises particular \\\\nconcerns around accountability. Moreover, we have questions \\\\nabout FINRA leadership&#x27;s supervision of its operations and \\\\nactivities, including its enforcement function, which market \\\\nparticipants tell me is inflicting unnecessary and excessive \\\\ncosts and uncertainty on the industry.\\\\n    As a self-regulatory organization (SRO), we would also \\\\nexpect to see increased formal engagement from FINRA on issues \\\\ncritical to the brokerage industry. These include, but are not \\\\nlimited to, the SEC&#x27;s proposed Regulation Best Interest (Reg \\\\nBI), a rule which FINRA has had on its books and effectively \\\\nenforced for decades; the so-called predictive data analytics \\\\nrule, which would strike at the heart of the brokerage \\\\nindustry&#x27;s ability to serve its customers with basic \\\\ntechnology; and the substantial costs and privacy concerns \\\\nassociated with the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT).\\\\n    And yet, FINRA has declined to provide formal comments to \\\\nthe SEC on many of these key issues, showing too much deference \\\\nto SEC Chair Gensler and his progressive agenda. For far too \\\\nlong, FINRA has escaped serious oversight from this committee, \\\\nand now, under Republican leadership, those days are over.\\\\n    Finally, FASB&#x27;s recent initiatives warrant attention, \\\\nparticularly its approach to income tax disclosures and the \\\\ninclusion of sustainability reporting in its 2023 Strategic \\\\nPlan. While supporting FASB&#x27;s goal of offering valuable \\\\ninformation to investors, we must ensure that these new \\\\nprojects are not influenced by activists and don&#x27;t serve as a \\\\nconduit for pushing social and political agendas into Generally \\\\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In light of these \\\\npressing issues, it is imperative for Congress to closely \\\\nscrutinize proposed changes, regulatory expansions, and their \\\\ncomprehensive effects on market efficiency, investor trust, and \\\\nthe robustness of our financial systems.\\\\n    I want to urge all panelists today to engage in thoughtful \\\\nand collaborative discussions addressing these concerns. \\\\nCongress keeps a vigilant eye on these developments, and it is \\\\nimperative that our regulatory frameworks align with market \\\\nneeds, bolster accountability, and stimulate growth, while \\\\nupholding the highest standards of integrity and transparency. \\\\nAnd I thank you all for being here today.\\\\n    The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the \\\\nsubcommittee, the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, for 4 \\\\nminutes for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Thank you for holding this hearing. Nothing \\\\ncould bring more joy to a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who \\\\nserves on this committee than bringing these witnesses before \\\\nus.\\\\n    A lot of us in Congress make sacrifices because we want to \\\\nplay an important role in making national policy, so we are a \\\\nlittle jealous of the people in front of us since they also \\\\nmake very important national policy, but they get to do so at \\\\nprivate-sector salaries and with a level of anonymity of which \\\\nmany of my friends and colleagues who have had demonstrations \\\\nin front of their homes could only dream.\\\\n    We have a democracy in which we elect the people who have \\\\ngovernmental power. With the Executive Branch, you elect a \\\\nPresident, who then appoints the people with governmental \\\\npower. With the PCAOB, you get third degree: you elect a \\\\nPresident, who appoints an SEC, who then appoints the PCAOB. \\\\nBut with the other two entities in front of us, there is no \\\\nconnection between the voters, on the one hand, and the \\\\nexercise of governmental power on the other.\\\\n    It is said that elections have consequences, but not when \\\\nit comes to the FASB or FINRA. And I am not surprised at all \\\\nthat the crypto world and the crypto billionaire bros want \\\\ntheir own SRO so that they can have a patina of regulation, be \\\\nin control themselves, and not have that regulation answerable \\\\nin any way to the American people. We hold the President \\\\nresponsible for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), we \\\\nhold the President responsible, in large part, for the economy, \\\\nand yet the folks in front of us here have very substantial \\\\neconomic impact over which no elected official has much \\\\ninfluence, although we do get to invite them here and talk to \\\\nthem.\\\\n    Speaking of listening to anybody, I have been working on \\\\nFASB, to repeat FASB No. 2, which requires the immediate write-\\\\noff of research expenses. If you build a laboratory, you \\\\ncapitalize the cost of building the laboratory. If you do \\\\nresearch in a laboratory, you have to immediately expense and \\\\nhurt your earnings per share for the work done in that \\\\nlaboratory.\\\\n    It is true that the financial world has adjusted to this \\\\npernicious, unjustified, and theoretically bankrupt \\\\npronouncement, so they think they are already dealing with it. \\\\nBut I suggest that if we made people write off the cost of \\\\nbuilding laboratories, fewer laboratories would be built.\\\\n    FASB now has a rule for putting crypto on the balance \\\\nsheet. I think crypto is a collection of pet rocks and it does \\\\nnot belong on the balance sheet. But what FASB has not done is \\\\ngive us accounting standards for environmental, social, and \\\\ngovernance (ESG) factors, for human resources, or for just \\\\nbasic things like same-store sales. I am glad that they are \\\\nworking on a definition of EBITDA (earnings before interest, \\\\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization), but there are so many \\\\nmeasures, and in 100 years, very little has been done in the \\\\naccounting world beyond the income statement, balance sheet, \\\\nand funds statement.\\\\n    I would say that the pressure on FASB is that the only \\\\npeople they listen to are the stock analysts, and the analysts \\\\ndo not have the national economy in mind. They do not have in \\\\nmind the interests of those people who do not use stock \\\\nanalysts but make their own decisions. But what the stock \\\\nanalysts want is for you to predict the future, which you \\\\ncannot do verifiably, and which you cannot do accurately. But \\\\nwhat a stock analysts wants to know is not what happened in the \\\\npast, but what is a stock going to be worth in the future.\\\\n    With PCAOB, I&#x27;m glad we have pretty much dealt with the \\\\nChina issue. I led the effort here in the House on the Holding \\\\nForeign Companies Accountable Act, and the Accelerating Holding \\\\nForeign Companies Accountable Act, with strong support from \\\\nthis committee, and I want to thank everyone involved. And now, \\\\nMr. Luetkemeyer and I have the Holding Chinese Listed Companies \\\\nAccountable Act, to call for the PCAOB to look at these \\\\nstatements annually. Of course, we have seen the recent $8-\\\\nmillion fine of one Hong Kong-based accounting firm.\\\\n    So, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses here. And \\\\nI thank you for having this hearing.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. Thank you, Ranking Member Sherman. The \\\\nChair now recognizes the ranking member of the full Financial \\\\nServices Committee, the gentlelady from California, Ms. Waters, \\\\nfor 1 minute.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman.\\\\n    Today, we will hear what happens when Wall Street and other \\\\nparts of the industry police themselves. So-called self-\\\\nregulatory organizations, like FINRA, are tasked with \\\\ngovernment functions that most Americans would assume are done \\\\nby government officials, like writing rules, examining records, \\\\nand levying fines.\\\\n    FINRA, whose leadership is appointed by Wall Street, \\\\nimposes weaker penalties compared to government regulators. It \\\\nlets brokers&#x27; misconduct go unchecked, permits board member \\\\nconflicts-of-interest, and lacks any cap on executive \\\\ncompensation. In fact, FINRA&#x27;s CEO, Mr. Cook, made $3.6 million \\\\nlast year, which is roughly 15 times the salary of SEC Chair \\\\nGary Gensler. Moreover, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking \\\\nBoard (MSRB) has broad-sector, wide regulatory authority \\\\nsimilar to FINRA, and it was not even invited to testify here \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    Reforms are long overdue. I have already started planning, \\\\nand I hope Members will join me in writing legislation to \\\\nfinally rein them in.\\\\n    Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my time.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    Today, we welcome the testimony of Ms. Erica Williams, the \\\\nChair of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; Mr. \\\\nRobert Cook, the President and CEO of the Financial Industry \\\\nRegulatory Authority; and Mr. Richard Jones, the Chair of the \\\\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board.\\\\n    I want to thank each of you for taking the time to be here. \\\\nEach of you will be recognized for 5 minutes to give an oral \\\\npresentation of your testimony, and without objection, each of \\\\nyour written statements will be made a part of the record.\\\\n    Ms. Williams, you are now recognized for 5 minutes to give \\\\nyour oral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n     STATEMENT OF ERICA Y. WILLIAMS, CHAIR, PUBLIC COMPANY \\\\n               ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (PCAOB)\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you, Chairwoman Wagner, Ranking Member \\\\nSherman, Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and members \\\\nof the subcommittee. I am grateful for the opportunity to \\\\nappear before you today to discuss our shared commitment to \\\\nprotecting investors in the U.S. markets.\\\\n    I am obligated to note that I am testifying on behalf of \\\\nmyself, as Chair of the Public Company Accounting Oversight \\\\nBoard, and my comments do not necessarily reflect the views of \\\\nother board members or PCAOB staff.\\\\n    I want to start by thanking you for your commitment to \\\\nholding China accountable. Because of the leadership of the \\\\nU.S. Congress in passing the Holding Foreign Companies \\\\nAccountable Act, the PCAOB secured complete access to inspect \\\\nand investigate registered public accounting firms in China for \\\\nthe first time in history. As a direct result of that access, \\\\nthe PCAOB recently announced historic enforcement actions \\\\nagainst China-based audit firms and individuals.\\\\n    The days of China-based firms evading accountability are \\\\nover. Our work holding firms in China accountable is just \\\\nbeginning. Investors in U.S. markets are more protected today \\\\nbecause of Congress&#x27; leadership, so thank you for your ongoing \\\\nefforts.\\\\n    My path to the PCAOB starts with my grandmother. She and my \\\\ngrandfather were farmers in Alabama, and she quite literally \\\\nkept what little money she had under her mattress. She did not \\\\ntrust it to a bank, let alone the stock market. The problem \\\\nwith money under the mattress is that it does not grow. \\\\nBuilding wealth requires investing, and investing requires \\\\ntrust. So when I became the first person in my family to go to \\\\nlaw school, I chose to go into securities enforcement in order \\\\nto hold wrongdoers accountable and help bolster the integrity \\\\nof, and breed confidence in, our capital markets.\\\\n    I am proud to continue serving investors at the PCAOB. As \\\\nwith our work in China, protecting investors drives everything \\\\nwe do, from workers saving for retirement in Missouri, to \\\\nfamilies investing in California, to businesses creating jobs \\\\nin North Carolina because they can raise money through sound, \\\\nliquid markets, and to anyone across this country who depends \\\\non the integrity of the U.S. capital markets to realize their \\\\nversion of the American Dream. Quality audits protect people, \\\\nand protecting people is what the PCAOB&#x27;s mission is all about.\\\\n    We have three key goals to accomplish that mission: \\\\nstandards, inspections, and enforcement. When the PCAOB was \\\\nfirst getting off the ground in 2003, it adopted existing \\\\nstandards that had been set by the auditing profession on what \\\\nwas intended to be an interim basis. Unfortunately, far too \\\\nmany have not been significantly updated in at least 20 years. \\\\nOur capital markets do not stand still. They evolve constantly. \\\\nPractices change, technology advances relentlessly, and new \\\\nrisks emerge.\\\\n    To keep investors protected, our standards must keep up, \\\\nwhich is why we are working to advance an ambitious agenda to \\\\nmodernize PCAOB standards and rules. The public comment period \\\\nis an absolutely essential part of that process, and we \\\\ncarefully weigh each and every comment we receive.\\\\n    At the same time, our Inspections Division is also hard at \\\\nwork. Our teams inspect roughly 800 audits in more than 30 \\\\njurisdictions around the world each year. This year, we \\\\nenhanced our transparency by including a new section on auditor \\\\nindependence, and a range of other improvements in our \\\\ninspection reports, and we rolled out new features on our \\\\nwebsite to help users access and compare inspection report \\\\ndata.\\\\n    Finally, we are strengthening our enforcement program to \\\\nensure accountability, promote deterrence, and protect \\\\ninvestors. Last year, we imposed the highest penalties in PCAOB \\\\nhistory. And this year, we have nearly doubled that record.\\\\n    Our capital markets are the envy of the world, and they are \\\\nfueled by investor confidence. The role of auditors is to \\\\nbolster that confidence by providing investors with assurance \\\\nthat the financial reporting they rely on to make decisions is \\\\naccurate. The role of the PCAOB is to hold auditors accountable \\\\nfor living up to that responsibility.\\\\n    I am proud of the work we are doing every day on behalf of \\\\ninvestors, and I look forward to answering your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Williams can be found on \\\\npage 56 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. Thank you, Ms. Williams.\\\\n    Mr. Cook, you are now recognized for 5 minutes to give your \\\\noral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n       STATEMENT OF ROBERT W. COOK, PRESIDENT AND CEO, \\\\n       FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (FINRA)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Chairwoman Wagner, Ranking Member Sherman, and \\\\nRanking Member Waters, thank you so much for the opportunity to \\\\ndiscuss the important work that FINRA is doing to fulfill our \\\\nmission under the Federal securities laws to protect investors \\\\nand safeguard market integrity, while facilitating vibrant \\\\ncapital markets--I inadvertently left out members of the \\\\nsubcommittee, so thank you all as well.\\\\n    The last several years have witnessed a period of \\\\ncontinuing evolution for the securities markets. Throughout \\\\nthis time, FINRA has continued to adapt and innovate under the \\\\nclose supervision of the SEC, and drawing on our status as a \\\\nprivate, not-for-profit self-regulatory organization, to \\\\nleverage the expertise of those we regulate, which helps us \\\\nunderstand and react quickly to market events, enhance our \\\\nregulatory programs, promote compliance, and tailor our \\\\nrulemaking and other initiatives to meet regulatory objectives.\\\\n    This afternoon, I would like to focus on three main areas: \\\\nprotecting investors; maintaining confidence in the markets; \\\\nand supporting capital formation.\\\\n    FINRA&#x27;s regulatory programs work every day to protect \\\\ninvestors, particularly retail investors and those most-\\\\nvulnerable to potential abuse. We regularly monitor and examine \\\\nclose to 3,400 member firms for compliance. When firms fall \\\\nshort of their regulatory obligations, we investigate and \\\\nrespond appropriately, including through disciplinary actions \\\\nthat address wrongdoing, deter misconduct, obtain restitution \\\\nfor investors, and remove bad actors from the broker-dealer \\\\nindustry.\\\\n    The U.S. capital markets are the best in the world, and \\\\nwhile the vast majority of firms and individuals that FINRA \\\\noversees are dedicated to serving their clients with integrity \\\\nand professionalism, outliers can pose significant harm to \\\\ninvestors.\\\\n    We recently implemented innovative rules to identify and \\\\naddress risks posed by firms and brokers with a significant \\\\nhistory of misconduct before they can do more harm to \\\\ninvestors. And we continue to prioritize protecting senior \\\\ninvestors and vulnerable adults. For example, we adopted a rule \\\\npermitting a member firm to contact a customer&#x27;s designated \\\\ntrusted contact person if they suspect financial exploitation, \\\\nand place a temporary hold on questionable transactions or \\\\ndisbursements, as well as a rule that limits brokers from being \\\\nnamed a beneficiary or holding similar positions of trust on \\\\nbehalf of a customer.\\\\n    And we are not just focused on senior investors. Research \\\\nby the FINRA Foundation has shown that many new retail \\\\ninvestors have joined the markets in recent years. These \\\\ninvestors tend to be younger and more racially and ethnically \\\\ndiverse, with lower household incomes and much smaller account \\\\nbalances. They also report using complex products and relying \\\\non social media for investment information. FINRA is seeking to \\\\nadapt and expand our educational content and other tools to \\\\nbetter support informed decision-making by these investors, \\\\nincluding delivering content where newer investors seek \\\\ninformation.\\\\n    In addition to protecting retail and institutional \\\\ninvestors, FINRA, in recent years, has invested heavily in \\\\ntechnology so that we can better protect market integrity by \\\\nconducting ongoing surveillance of billions of market events \\\\neach day for potential misconduct. FINRA deploys a range of \\\\nsophisticated algorithms to analyze market data and detect \\\\npotential rule violations across markets. We also promote \\\\ntransparency by making information on market transactions \\\\navailable to the public, which helps inform investors and \\\\nreduce transaction costs.\\\\n    Finally, FINRA continually looks for opportunities to \\\\nsupport capital formation where consistent with investor \\\\nprotection, both by addressing unnecessary barriers and by \\\\nstopping activities that could undermine confidence in the \\\\ncapital formation process. In recent years, FINRA launched two \\\\ninitiatives to identify how FINRA can support capital \\\\nformation. These initiatives have produced results, from \\\\nmodernizing our corporate financing rule and public offering \\\\nsystem, to removing impediments to smaller firms participating \\\\nin the capital formation process.\\\\n    In conclusion, as the markets continue to change, and \\\\nretail investors are presented with both new opportunities and \\\\nrisks, FINRA remains firmly focused on its statutory mission. \\\\nWe look forward to maintaining our ongoing engagement with \\\\nCongress, other regulators, market participants, and the \\\\ninvesting public.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today, and I \\\\nlook forward to answering your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Cook can be found on page 32 \\\\nof the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. Thank you, Mr. Cook.\\\\n    Mr. Jones, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your \\\\noral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n        STATEMENT OF RICHARD R. JONES, CHAIR, FINANCIAL \\\\n              ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Jones. Thank you, Chairwoman Wagner, Ranking Member \\\\nSherman, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the \\\\nsubcommittee. My name is Richard Jones, and I serve as the \\\\nChair of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, also known \\\\nas the FASB.\\\\n    Before joining the Board in 2020, I spent over 30 years in \\\\npublic accounting, where I was responsible for interpreting and \\\\napplying FASB standards across a wide range of industries. That \\\\nrole gave me a deep appreciation for the importance of \\\\naccounting standards in accurately depicting and transparently \\\\ncommunicating a company&#x27;s financial condition to its investors \\\\nand other capital allocators.\\\\n    Today, I am honored to be a member of an organization that \\\\nplays such a key role in our capital markets. I am also honored \\\\nto appear before you today and answer your questions.\\\\n    Founded in 1973, the FASB&#x27;s mission is to establish and \\\\nimprove financial accounting and reporting standards to provide \\\\ndecision-useful information to investors and other allocators \\\\nof capital. This includes all investors and allocators of \\\\ncapital that use financial statements to make capital \\\\nallocation decisions, from the smallest pension plan seeking to \\\\nmaximize returns for its participants, to the largest actively-\\\\ntraded mutual fund. We accomplish our mission through a \\\\ncomprehensive and independent process that encourages broad \\\\nparticipation, objectively considers all stakeholder views, and \\\\nis subject to oversight by the Financial Accounting \\\\nFoundation&#x27;s board of trustees.\\\\n    Independent standard-setting is both a great asset and a \\\\ngreat privilege. It is a great asset because it allows the FASB \\\\nto solicit and incorporate diverse views into our process, \\\\nproviding investors and other allocators of capital with \\\\nrelevant, unbiased information in the most cost-effective way \\\\npossible.\\\\n    And it is a privilege because the FASB must continuously \\\\nearn the right to set standards. Every day, we work to earn \\\\nthat right by engaging in a robust and inclusive and \\\\ntransparent process with the active participation of our \\\\nstakeholders. We are judged by how well we execute that \\\\nprocess.\\\\n    Members of the FASB come from diverse professional \\\\nbackgrounds. While each of us brings different experience to \\\\nthe table, we are equally committed to our mission to provide \\\\ndecision-useful information to investors and other allocators \\\\nof capital, and the continuous improvement of standards that \\\\nconstitute U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \\\\n(GAAP). Our standards are designed to provide investors and \\\\nother allocators of capital with financial, accounting, and \\\\nreporting information for investment decisions. Even so, we \\\\nrecognize that other parties may choose to use that information \\\\nas a starting point for other purposes, including regulating \\\\ncertain industries, taxation, and other public policy matters. \\\\nHow and when GAAP information is used in the adjustments that \\\\nare made is within the discretion of the bodies who choose to \\\\nuse GAAP as a starting point.\\\\n    We are always available to all parties to answer questions \\\\nabout how our standards operate, and we are always open to new \\\\nways of increasing participation in our process. History shows \\\\nthat we make the best decisions when we consider all views, \\\\nwhich is why stakeholder outreach is at the heart of everything \\\\nthat we do. For our standards to be successful, they must be \\\\nable to be applied by accountants, audited by auditors, and \\\\nprovide unbiased decision-useful information to investors and \\\\nother allocators of capital.\\\\n    The participation of those parties, and other parties in \\\\nour process, is essential. For example, during our most-recent \\\\nagenda consultation process, we solicited a broad range of \\\\nstakeholders&#x27; views to help us set the direction of our \\\\nstandards-setting efforts. We went out with an open mind, and a \\\\nclean sheet of paper, and applied a rigorous process. And the \\\\nfeedback from all of our stakeholder groups was tremendous, \\\\nincluding a 300-percent increase in investor participation \\\\nsince our last agenda consultation in 2016.\\\\n    The FASB has made significant progress in addressing that \\\\ninput by adding new projects to our agenda, setting direction \\\\nfor existing projects, and executing on that revised agenda. \\\\nOur work does not end when a standard has been issued. Our \\\\nongoing post-implementation reviews of the revenue recognition, \\\\nleases, and credit losses standards continue to help us fine-\\\\ntune these areas.\\\\n    We recognize that high-quality accounting standards that \\\\nfacilitate the effective operation of the capital markets are \\\\nin the public interest. The FASB continues our 50-year journey \\\\nto earn the privilege of setting standards by engaging in the \\\\nrobust, inclusive process that has built the comprehensive body \\\\nof GAAP that we have today.\\\\n    My written testimony provides more detailed information \\\\nabout the FASB and our projects and activities. Thank you for \\\\nthe opportunity to appear here today, and I look forward to \\\\nanswering your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Jones can be found on page \\\\n50 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. Thank you very much, Mr. Jones.\\\\n    We will now turn to Member questions, and I recognize \\\\nmyself for 5 minutes for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cook, as a self-regulatory organization (SRO), there is \\\\nan anticipation for heightened formal engagement from FINRA \\\\nregarding critical issues within the brokerage industry. This \\\\nincludes: first, the SEC&#x27;s proposed Regulation Best Execution \\\\n(Best Ex), a rule that FINRA has effectively enforced for \\\\nyears; second, the Predictive Data Analytics (PDA) Proposal, \\\\nwhich could significantly impact the industry&#x27;s technological \\\\nservices to customers; and third, the substantial costs and \\\\nprivacy concerns linked to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT).\\\\n    Let me ask you first, Mr. Cook, has FINRA sent formal \\\\ncomment letters to the SEC on its Best Ex and PDA proposals?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you, Chairwoman Wagner. We have on the Best \\\\nExecution proposal. I do not believe we have on the Predictive \\\\nData Analytics proposal.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. Are you going to?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. We do not have a plan at the moment, but we are \\\\nstill reviewing the content of the proposal, and it is possible \\\\nthat we will.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. FINRA has its own Best Execution Rule, \\\\ncorrect?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. That is true, yes.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. How long has it been in place, and how \\\\nmany times has it been updated over the years, based on \\\\nindustry feedback, sir?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I could not answer that question for you today. I \\\\ncan say it has been a long time that we have had that rule in \\\\nplace, and it has been modified and interpreted with guidance \\\\nmultiple times.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. Multiple times. Is FINRA&#x27;s Best \\\\nExecution Rule so deficient that the SEC needs to impose its \\\\nown rule, sir?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I do not believe FINRA&#x27;s Best Execution Rule has \\\\nbeen deficient. I do believe it is important to recognize that \\\\nthere has always been kind of two tiers of regulation here. The \\\\nSEC has had an approach to Best Execution through the anti-\\\\nfraud rules for a long time, and it has had engagement with \\\\nSROs on their Best Execution Rules for a long time.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. I am just concerned about expensive and \\\\ncostly redundancy here.\\\\n    And let me move on. Chair Williams, I am deeply, deeply \\\\nconcerned with the PCAOB&#x27;s NOCLAR proposal, which could compel \\\\nauditors to extend their responsibilities far beyond financial \\\\nstatement audits and essentially force them to function as law \\\\nenforcement agents. Over the last 2 years, more than 300,000 \\\\nauditors and accountants have left their positions, with many \\\\nof them citing the regulatory environment as a main factor for \\\\nleaving.\\\\n    Do you think that this proposal, which adds new liabilities \\\\nand costs to auditing firms and their employees, will make it \\\\nmore attractive to join this profession?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you for the question. The NOCLAR \\\\nproposal right now is just at the proposal stage, and it is \\\\ncritical for us to make sure that we are getting public comment \\\\non the proposal so that we can make sure that we get the final \\\\nrule right.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. Good. I hope that you are taking \\\\neverything into account here, Chair Williams, from a lot of \\\\ndifferent stakeholders. The NOCLAR proposal is anticipated to \\\\nhave a significant financial impact, with estimates indicating \\\\na substantial increase in auditing fees by $18.2 billion, \\\\naccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and overall \\\\ncompliance costs possibly reaching upwards of $83 billion, \\\\naccording to the Audit Committee Council.\\\\n    Could you provide details on the expected surge in auditing \\\\nfirms hiring attorneys and specialized experts to adhere to \\\\nNOCLAR, and what estimates has the PCAOB made regarding the \\\\nassociated costs?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you for that question. The PCAOB has \\\\nincluded an economic analysis in our proposal, and we are very \\\\ninterested in making sure that we receive comments on that \\\\nproposal. We thank you, Chairwoman Wagner, and Chairman \\\\nMcHenry, for the comment letter that you provided. We are \\\\nreading and weighing every comment that we receive. Many \\\\ncommenters have asked us to hold a public roundtable so that we \\\\ncould receive even more feedback on that proposal.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. I would encourage you to do that. These \\\\ncosts are just exorbitant. We have accountants and auditors \\\\nleaving the field, and I do not want to make them police \\\\nofficers; they are auditors.\\\\n    In addition to auditor fees, I am very concerned that \\\\nNOCLAR would result in an audited company needing to spend \\\\nadditional capital and use more company resources than they \\\\nwould have previously. Could you elaborate on the anticipated \\\\nfinancial impact on public companies, specifically on their \\\\nfinance teams and other relevant departments, resulting from \\\\nthe implementation of NOCLAR?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes. We are going to be holding the public \\\\nroundtable in the new year in response to the comments that we \\\\nreceived thus far. And our intent in the NOCLAR proposal is to \\\\nmake sure that hardworking Americans are not put at risk by \\\\ncompanies who violate rules and standards. We believe that the \\\\nauditors currently have a role to make sure that companies are \\\\nnot engaged in fraud, and we are weighing all of the comments \\\\nto make sure that ultimately, we get that final----\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. My time has expired, Ms. Williams. I am \\\\nso sorry. And if you have any more information regarding this \\\\nquestion, please submit it for the record.\\\\n    And I now recognize the distinguished ranking member of the \\\\nsubcommittee, Mr. Sherman, for 5 minutes for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Thank you. I think there is support for your \\\\nwork in NOCLAR, but a lot of investors are at risk when \\\\ncompanies flagrantly violate the laws that govern them. Sam \\\\nBankman-Fried is just one example. And I know that you will \\\\nconsult with industry and others and try to fine-tune that \\\\nproposal.\\\\n    With regard to FASB, I think you are making some real \\\\nprogress on software and allowing those costs to be capitalized \\\\nor causing yet software development and other kinds of research \\\\nare almost indistinguishable as to the accounting issues they \\\\nraise, and I hope that you will look at not only doing what you \\\\nare going to do on software, but applying those same standards \\\\nto research.\\\\n    Congress spends many billions of dollars incentivizing \\\\nresearch, and while you can say that your rule of requiring it \\\\nto be immediately written off does not influence behavior, I \\\\nhave yet to meet an honest corporate executive who tells me \\\\nthat they do not care about earnings per share and bonuses \\\\nwhich usually rely on that figure.\\\\n    But there are a number of other things on the FASB plate. \\\\nBasically, we have dealt with three accounting statements for \\\\nover a century. The third one is only about 50-years-old, and \\\\nthat one is just a rate compilation of what is in the income \\\\nstatement and the balance sheet. We need more information where \\\\nyou write the definitions and we can rely on the number.\\\\n    You are working on EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, \\\\nDepreciation, and Amortization) but that is just a \\\\nrecompilation of numbers you already have on the income \\\\nstatement. Maybe a little fine-tuning.\\\\n    Can you give me yes-or-no answers? Do you currently have a \\\\nproject to define same-store sales?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. No, we do not.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. How about human resource metrics, such as \\\\naverage tenure of each employee or turnover rate?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. No, we do not.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. And anything on carbon or carbon footprint?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. No, we do not.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Then, you have a lot of work to do.\\\\n    Ms. Williams, I think we have already dealt with this, but \\\\ncan we count on you to have these roundtables and other \\\\ndiscussions as you develop additional rules, particularly the \\\\nones that the chairwoman was talking about?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes, we are going to be holding a public \\\\nroundtable on the NOCLAR proposal in the new year.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Okay. Mr. Cook, you now have a system where I \\\\ncan pick the name of an individual broker or brokerage firm and \\\\nuse BrokerCheck to see whether it has been designated for \\\\nmalfeasance. But what you do not do is just publish the whole \\\\nlist, so I can just browse and see names that might be in my \\\\ncommunity. Is there some reason why you do not just publish the \\\\nwhole list so I can look at it?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Do you mean the whole list of brokers or the \\\\nwhole list of----\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Those that are listed in BrokerCheck as having \\\\nhad a history of malfeasance.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. You can search in BrokerCheck. Do you mean a \\\\nspecial list just for those?\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Yes. Just publish the whole list of everybody \\\\nwho comes up as malfeasance.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I think the challenge there is we would have to \\\\ndefine what we mean by malfeasance. BrokerCheck requires a wide \\\\nrange of disclosures in the interest of full transparency, but \\\\nthey are not all the same. Sometimes, if you just have a \\\\ncustomer complaint that is unverified, you have something in \\\\nBrokerCheck.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. And can you just browse the whole list and \\\\nlook at every name and see what complaints or whatever they \\\\nhave?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. There is not one specific list for a particular \\\\ntype of malfeasance, but we certainly could----\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Or just a list including those who have no \\\\naccusations of malfeasance.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I am happy to take back whether there are ways we \\\\ncan change the presentation of the database to address that.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. The SEC is currently working on a Best \\\\nExecution standard as part of its market equity structure. You \\\\nhave a Best Execution standard. Have you been talking to the \\\\nSEC about what kind of standard they might have, and is there a \\\\nneed for us to have a different standard than the Best \\\\nExecution standard that FINRA has?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. We have had conversations with the SEC about the \\\\ndesign of their proposal. Of course, it is important for us \\\\nthat they understand what our rule has covered and our \\\\nexperience with the rule.\\\\n    They have laid out their own reasons why they may want to \\\\nhave their own rule, to be able to enforce it, to be able to \\\\ndefine policy. I think the question about duplication is an \\\\nimportant one here, and we would need to address that. If the \\\\nSEC adopts a rule, it does not make sense to have firms try to \\\\nfigure out if there is daylight between our two rules, and we \\\\nwill need to adjust that accordingly.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. If their rule is tougher, you might not need \\\\nyours.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \\\\nrecognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I was a member of \\\\nthis committee during the oversight hearings held to examine \\\\nthe extraordinary market movement back in 2010 known as the, \\\\n``flash crash,&#x27;&#x27; in which the Dow Jones lost nearly 600 points \\\\nin just 5 minutes, before recovering. In response to the crash, \\\\nthe Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) was established to monitor \\\\nequities and options data across the U.S. markets. FINRA and \\\\nthe national exchanges have adopted rules for the CAT with \\\\nwhich members must comply.\\\\n    Mr. Cook, I would like to discuss the operational cost of \\\\nCAT. It is fair to say that CAT has been much more expensive \\\\nthan originally anticipated. Does the cost of operating the CAT \\\\nhave an impact on the SEC or FINRA&#x27;s budget, or are all of \\\\nthose costs passed on to the members?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you, sir. To be clear, the CAT is operated \\\\nby the consortium of SROs, and I cannot speak for them, but I \\\\nwill try to answer your question as best I can.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Please.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. That consortium filed a rule proposal with the \\\\nSEC for how the cost would be allocated amongst the SROs and \\\\nthe members of the industry. It does not come out of the SEC&#x27;s \\\\nbudget. It comes out of a fee allocation that has been approved \\\\nby the SEC. We commented negatively on that proposal, I think \\\\ntwice, but it has been approved. And it is now being challenged \\\\nin court.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. What steps have been taken to reduce operations \\\\ncosts?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Managing the cost is a critical element here. I \\\\nwant to point out that the initial estimates for CAT were based \\\\non an assumption about how much volume there would be, \\\\nessentially, and those estimates turned out to be way off. We \\\\nare now seeing volumes that are 10 times what they were \\\\nestimated to be. And of course, volumes translate to processing \\\\ncosts, and storage costs for data, so naturally, the costs are \\\\nhigher.\\\\n    But it is very important to continue to work to reduce the \\\\ncosts. I think there are opportunities to do that going \\\\nforward.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Continuing down that line, do you have an \\\\nestimate for how much of the costs of CAT are driven by usage \\\\nfrom regulators and SROs versus simply the processing of the \\\\nincoming data?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I cannot speak for CAT LLC on this, but to try to \\\\nanswer your question, I think most of the costs, maybe 75 \\\\npercent, have to do with processing the data. I do not know how \\\\nmuch of the costs are associated with extracting the data.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Last question on this topic. Is there a \\\\nmechanism in place for market participants to examine the CAT&#x27;s \\\\nfunding and decision-making?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. The funding went through notice and comment, sort \\\\nof an SEC approval process, so there were opportunities for the \\\\nindustry to weigh in at that point. Some people objected to it, \\\\nas we did. Also, within the CAT structure, I think concerns \\\\nhave been raised about the lack of industry participation in \\\\nit. I recognize those. Again, I cannot speak for the CAT LLC, \\\\nbut there is a formal advisory committee that helps provide \\\\nadvice to CAT LLC, but they do not have voting power.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Chair Jones, you discussed in your testimony how \\\\nFASB is proactive with stakeholder outreach to identify areas \\\\nof improvement and to potentially develop new accounting \\\\nstandards. Are there any new accounting standards that FASB is \\\\nproactively seeking feedback on right now?\\\\n    Mr. Jones. Yes, sir. In fact, it is our whole agenda. We \\\\nare benefitting right now from extensive outreach that we did 2 \\\\nyears ago. As I mentioned in my opening testimony, we do go out \\\\nto our stakeholders with a blank sheet of paper, and ask them \\\\nwhat should be our highest priorities. I would say we have an \\\\ninvestor-driven agenda, and we focus on investors who actually \\\\nuse those financial segments to drive accounting decisions. And \\\\nas you look through our agenda, those projects all align with \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Do you believe there are reporting matters that \\\\nCongress would need to first provide a clear directive on \\\\nbefore FASB introduces a change, or in other words, what topics \\\\nmust Congress address before FASB can act?\\\\n    Mr. Jones. Sir, I cannot think of any that we need Congress \\\\nto address. I think that we are taking our charge of setting \\\\naccounting standards very seriously, very appropriately, and we \\\\nare focused on that and solely on that, the accounting \\\\nstandards for investment purposes.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. On that thought, I yield back, Madam Chairwoman.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \\\\nrecognizes the ranking member of the Full Committee, the \\\\ngentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman.\\\\n    Chair Williams, did I understand from your testimony that \\\\nyou are an attorney?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. And you worked at the SEC?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. And you were in the Enforcement Division?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. That is correct.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. So, you came to this job with a great \\\\nbackground and experience.\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you. I understand that there have been \\\\nRepublicans who have criticized you and questioned your ability \\\\nto lead the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) \\\\nbecause they say, ``Oh, she is not a certified public \\\\naccountant.&#x27;&#x27; I want you to know, Chair Williams, that I find \\\\nthese criticisms to be entirely without merit and quite \\\\nunacceptable.\\\\n    Did you know that all four previously appointed Chairs of \\\\nthe PCAOB were all White men, and were also not CPAs?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. That is correct.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. It is interesting that this criticism is coming \\\\nfrom Republicans now that we have the first Black woman serving \\\\nas the Chair of the PCAOB. Further, current law limits the \\\\nnumber of CPAs that can serve on PCAOB&#x27;s board to a maximum of \\\\ntwo. This was because Congress designed the PCAOB to have a \\\\nvariety of expertise on its board. And today&#x27;s PCAOB board \\\\nalready has two CPAs.\\\\n    Chair Williams, I know better than most that when women of \\\\ncolor rise to positions of power, we are often subjected to \\\\nunwarranted criticisms like this, so I wanted to set the record \\\\nstraight. And I also want to applaud you for your leadership. \\\\nFor example, the agreement that you reached with China&#x27;s \\\\nsecurities regulator better protects U.S. investors. This is an \\\\nagreement that none of the previous Board Chairs were able to \\\\ndo.\\\\n    With that, I want to pivot to ask you, Chair Williams, \\\\nabout the independence of auditors in the aftermath of the \\\\nrecent bank failures. KPMG served as the auditor for all three \\\\nof the banks that failed recently, causing many to wonder if \\\\nKPMG was operating on a sufficiently-independent basis.\\\\n    What steps has the PCAOB taken to ensure that auditors of \\\\nbanks maintain sufficient independence? What other lessons are \\\\nto be learned here, and do you have any recommendations for \\\\nCongress as we continue to look for ways to prevent future bank \\\\nfailures?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you for that question. Auditor \\\\nindependence is absolutely critical. We have taken several \\\\nsteps. First, we have added independence and ethics to our \\\\nstandards-setting agenda to make sure that the interim rule and \\\\nthose interim standards are up to today&#x27;s challenges.\\\\n    Second, we have expanded the independence information that \\\\nwe are providing in our inspection reports. And third, when we \\\\nfind independence violations, we do not hesitate to hold those \\\\nwho violate our independence and ethics rules accountable, and \\\\nthat is an example of one of the recent actions we brought in \\\\nChina.\\\\n    With respect to the bank failures from earlier this year, \\\\nlast year, in June of 2022, the PCAOB put out an alert \\\\nnotifying auditors that fluctuations in interest rates could \\\\npose financial reporting and auditing risks. And then, we \\\\nfollowed up by adding financial institutions that could be \\\\nsubject to those risks to our inspections as a priority area. \\\\nSo, that is an area on which we are very focused.\\\\n    I cannot talk about enforcement matters, but know that \\\\nanyone who is violating our rules will be held accountable to \\\\nmake sure that investors are protected.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. To clarify something that \\\\nI have been thinking about, when you talked about the \\\\nfluctuation in interest rates, was that caused because of \\\\ninflation and the securities that they were holding the \\\\ninterest rates at changed, had gone down quite substantially?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. In our alert, we notified auditors that \\\\ninterest rate fluctuations could definitely pose risks to \\\\nfinancial reporting and audits.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Let me go back to Mr. Cook. Mr. Cook, FINRA was designed by \\\\nCongress to serve the public interest. Unfortunately, Wall \\\\nStreet has gamed the system to stack the boards they would be \\\\nregulating with industry representatives, damaging the \\\\nconfidence of investors and policymakers. To understand how \\\\nthis infiltration of Wall Street interests has compromised the \\\\npublic interest missions of SROs, look no further than FINRA&#x27;s \\\\nrefusal to rid its membership of high-risk broker firms that \\\\nprey on investors, targeting communities of color, immigrants, \\\\nand senior citizens.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. The gentlelady&#x27;s time has expired. The \\\\ngentleman can respond in writing for the record. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman \\\\nfrom Texas, Mr. Sessions, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Madam Chairwoman, thank you very much for \\\\ncalling this hearing today. I think it is important for each of \\\\nyou to be here in front of this subcommittee, and we appreciate \\\\nyou.\\\\n    Mr. Cook, thank you very much, in particular. I have been \\\\nspending a good bit of time with your organization, and I want \\\\nyou to know that I believe that they are doing their very best \\\\nto keep us updated on matters that we have before us.\\\\n    I am going to make just a general statement here, but I \\\\nbelieve it is for Chair Williams. According to the Bureau of \\\\nLabor Statistics, over 300,000 accountants and auditors have \\\\nleft their practice in the last 2 years, a 17-percent decline \\\\nin the number of people who are in the industry. A recent \\\\nsurvey revealed that the regulatory environment makes the \\\\nprofession unappealing to many aspiring accountants, with 64 \\\\npercent saying it is the deterrent to them pursuing their CPA \\\\nlicense.\\\\n    I think that our chairwoman spoke about not workload, but \\\\nperhaps an overabundance of workload, perhaps maybe an activist \\\\nperspective, as she used that word. And while I do want you to \\\\nhave and the industry to have professionals who are up to not \\\\nonly change, but an opportunity to see what professional \\\\ntraining they need and to stay after that, I just wondered what \\\\nis your perspective about hearing this feedback from people \\\\nprobably who left or observations they had?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you for that question. We absolutely \\\\nwant to make sure that more accounting students are thinking of \\\\naccounting as a profession for them, and also that those who \\\\nare in the accounting profession stay. That is how we can \\\\ncontinue to protect investors and drive audit quality forward.\\\\n    At the PCAOB, we are doing our part, and Congress, in your \\\\nwisdom when you established us, determined that every dollar we \\\\ncollect from our enforcement matters should go to accounting \\\\nscholarships. Last, year we provided more scholarships to \\\\naccounting students than any other year in PCAOB history.\\\\n    I also am familiar with the survey that you referenced. The \\\\nlarge majority of the respondents in that survey found that \\\\npeople are not staying in accounting, or are not going into \\\\naccounting because of the lower salaries that the accounting \\\\nfirms are paying. And that is something that the firms need to \\\\naddress. But we at the PCAOB are working to try to alleviate \\\\nthe economic impact on accounting students by providing \\\\nscholarships.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. So, you believe you are listening, you have \\\\nread the report, you have discussed it, and you believe it is \\\\nbecause accounting majors are not being paid perhaps as much as \\\\nthey could be in a competitive marketplace. Is that correct?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. That was what the survey said.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. That is what the survey said. I have no \\\\nreason really to argue with that. I will tell you that I am \\\\npretty much in touch with people who are accountants, who feel \\\\nlike they believe in their work, and the money coexists with \\\\neach other, and I did not know that, so that is news to me.\\\\n    Mr. Cook, FINRA&#x27;s operating expenses were $1.094 billion--\\\\nthat is a pretty big operation--and you expect expenses to \\\\nincrease by 6 percent. Can you please talk to me about the \\\\nmoney and the agency and your work?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you for that question, sir. FINRA&#x27;s mission \\\\nis important and it is important that we fully fund that \\\\nmission. Our revenues come primarily from fees on the industry.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Our workload has grown over the years, and so, \\\\ntoo, have our expenses. And we have also made significant \\\\ncapital investments in technology to be able to do our work \\\\nmore efficiently. I think if you look over the past 10 years at \\\\nthe overall growth rate in our expenses and our size, it has \\\\nbeen well-constrained. Certainly, our expenses have grown less \\\\nthan the industry, and less than other regulators, but it is an \\\\nimportant mission. We have very complex markets with lots of \\\\ninvestors participating in them, and it is important that we \\\\nmake sure we fully resource our mission.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. One last point, Madam Chairwoman, and that is \\\\nin working with Mr. Cook&#x27;s organization, I am trying to move my \\\\nwork as well as their work more to find answers and away from \\\\nless investigation and more directly to the problems that \\\\npeople may bring to us. I just want you to know that we are \\\\ninvolved in that. And thank you very much. Thank you, Madam \\\\nChairwoman.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. \\\\nThe Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, \\\\nfor 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Chairwoman Wagner, and first let me \\\\ncompliment you on this hearing. This is a most important issue. \\\\nIt is one that, as you recall, we have been involved in \\\\ntogether before, the last time dealing with the horizon of the \\\\nLabor Department.\\\\n    But Mr. Cook, let me go to you. In your testimony, you \\\\noutlined how FINRA has been carefully examining member firms \\\\nfor compliance with the Regulation Best Interest requirement, \\\\nand you discussed your work in holding firms accountable--very \\\\nimportant--when they put their own interests ahead of the \\\\ninvestors&#x27; interests. Can you provide for us and give us just a \\\\nbrief assessment of the practices that FINRA has observed \\\\nduring their review process and through your ongoing talks with \\\\nfirms about their preparedness initiatives?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you very much, sir, for that question. \\\\nOversight of Regulation Best Interest is critical. It is \\\\nsomething we have been involved with closely since the \\\\nregulation was adopted. We work closely with the SEC because it \\\\nis their rule and they interpret it. They also inspect and \\\\nexamine for it, so we want to make sure we are closely \\\\ncoordinated.\\\\n    In the early days of the rule&#x27;s adoption, we were looking \\\\nat firms&#x27; efforts to come into compliance. There are a lot of \\\\npolicies, procedures, et cetera, that they need to adopt, and \\\\nwe saw them do so. More recently, we have been focusing on the \\\\nsubstantive obligations, and we do have findings that we share \\\\nwith the public.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. And do you believe there is any evidence to \\\\nsuggest that since June of 2019, implementation of the \\\\nRegulation Best Interest comprehensive framework has failed to \\\\nwork effectively to protect investors and retirement savers or \\\\nhas demonstrated a need to make far more aggressive changes to \\\\nthe existing rules?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I do not believe so, sir. The rule is still new. \\\\nIt is still evolving. The SEC continues to provide more \\\\nguidance about the requirements. But it has done some things \\\\nthat were not there before. We have a national standard, a \\\\ngeneral principle that you cannot put your interest ahead of \\\\nyour investors. We have specific compliance obligations--\\\\ndisclosure, conflict review, a care obligation. These all can \\\\nbe examined against.\\\\n    And most importantly, I think the SEC has created a uniform \\\\nframework across broker-dealers and investment advisors, where \\\\nsubstantially similar obligations are owed to both. And from an \\\\ninvestor perspective, that is important. It should not matter \\\\nwhere you go for your advice; you should get the same \\\\nprotections.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. And I will note that in 2022, customers filed \\\\n216 arbitration actions alleging a violation of Regulation Best \\\\nInterest through the FINRA arbitration process. That is more \\\\nthan five times as many claims as the year before, far and away \\\\nthe steepest increase of any type of claim. FINRA has taken \\\\nserious disciplinary actions, imposing a 6-month suspension, \\\\nand significant fines on brokers who recommended transactions \\\\nthat were not made in the customer&#x27;s best interest.\\\\n    Madam Chairwoman, I believe that FINRA is doing a \\\\nmagnificent job, and I believe they are doing it in a \\\\nremarkable way. And thank you. I yield back the balance of my \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. My good friend, Mr. Scott, yields back. \\\\nAnd the Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. \\\\nHuizenga, who is also the Chair of our Oversight and \\\\nInvestigations Subcommittee, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Chairwoman Wagner, and to our \\\\nwitnesses, it&#x27;s always good to see you all at various times and \\\\nat various functions over the years. Let me just jump right in.\\\\n    Chair Williams, let me start with you. When Congress \\\\ncreated the PCAOB in 2002, the word, ``independent,&#x27;&#x27; appeared \\\\nin statute 10 different times. Twenty-plus years later, do you \\\\nbelieve the PCAOB is living up to the spirit of the law that \\\\nCongress had created, in that it is actually independent?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Do you believe that your predecessors \\\\nwere able to be independent and free from politicization?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Now that we have established that, are you \\\\nrequired, as Chair, to run things through and receive the \\\\napproval of the Securities and Exchange Commission? I am \\\\nreferring to new standards, rules, and enforcement actions. \\\\nWhat level of coordination exists with the SEC?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you for that question. Our enforcement \\\\nactivity is independent and we do not run that through the SEC. \\\\nIf, however, a respondent wants to appeal a finding of a \\\\nhearing officer at the PCAOB, they can go through the board and \\\\nthen to the SEC and then to the Federal court.\\\\n    And you asked about standard-setting and rulemakings. Once \\\\nthe Board has approved their standard or rule, it does go to \\\\nthe SEC for a subsequent approval by the SEC.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. They have to approve whatever you are working \\\\non, correct?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. In the standards-setting and rulemaking \\\\nareas, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Yes, okay. Can Chair Gensler remove you?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes. The full Commission actually can remove \\\\nme, not the Chair alone.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Just help me out with this, and I am \\\\ngoing to go back to my original question. And I am not saying \\\\nyou, as a person, because I have gotten to know you over the \\\\nyears and I know you are a very independent-minded person, but \\\\nsometimes maybe the structure is not allowing you to do that. \\\\nAre you truly able to be independent, or is this another avenue \\\\nfor Chair Gensler to impose an agenda?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. The PCAOB does act independently.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. My colleagues might remember that last \\\\nCongress, I introduced a bill that would essentially fold the \\\\nPCAOB into the SEC. You would still exist. But in testimony \\\\nbefore this committee, Chair Gensler admitted that the PCAOB \\\\nwas, in fact, not independent. That is problematic in my mind, \\\\nand I believe that, frankly, politicization has crept in, and I \\\\nthink Congress should really take a serious look at my \\\\nlegislation.\\\\n    Mr. Cook, yesterday, Chairwoman Wagner and I sent a letter \\\\nto the SEC&#x27;s Inspector General asking them to conduct an audit \\\\nof the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT), which you received a \\\\ncopy of, and among other things, we asked the Inspector General \\\\nto examine the SEC&#x27;s jurisdiction as it pertains to the \\\\ncollection of personally identifiable information (PII) of \\\\nAmerican investors. Are you concerned that FINRA has the \\\\nauthority to access sensitive financial data from everyday \\\\nAmerican investors in the CAT database without evidence or \\\\nsuspicion of a crime or violation?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you for that, sir, and I think the \\\\nprotection of the data that is in the database is critical. \\\\nThere are safeguards around access. Each SRO that could have \\\\naccess to it, is to be doing so on a need-to-know basis. I do \\\\nnot know whether that applies to the SEC, but I know it applies \\\\nto the SROs.\\\\n    So, we have policies and procedures in place to limit who \\\\ncan access it and to make sure there are controls around it. \\\\nBut I have said before----\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Let me interrupt you there. In the past, you \\\\nhave talked about, ``other approaches,&#x27;&#x27; when it comes to \\\\nsatisfying regulatory needs versus concerns over privacy and \\\\ndata security. Can you elaborate on what those approaches might \\\\nentail? We are having a little bit of this conversation, \\\\nfrankly, about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA \\\\n) right now. Who can access very sensitive information, under \\\\nwhat circumstances, and do they do they not need a warrant to \\\\ndo so?\\\\n    Please explain a little bit of what you think some other \\\\napproaches might entail?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. It is a critical question of whether we got the \\\\nbalance right, because on the one hand, the data in that \\\\ndatabase--there are two databases, a transaction database and a \\\\ncustomer database. The data in the customer database is there \\\\nto help investigations. But if you ask, as a regulator, ``Do \\\\nyou want more data?&#x27;&#x27;, they are going to say, ``Yes, I want \\\\nmore data,&#x27;&#x27; but that cannot be the only consideration. We also \\\\nneed to think about other considerations, including risk and \\\\nprivacy.\\\\n    Some of the other ideas that have been considered along the \\\\nway, sir, include limiting who is in that database, large \\\\ntraders, which would be a small subset of the people who are \\\\ntrading in the markets, having a request response system. So, \\\\nthere are some other alternatives that have been considered.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. My time has expired. I look forward to \\\\npursuing this in some written questions, as well, so thank you. \\\\nI yield back.\\\\n    Chairwoman Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \\\\nrecognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Casten, for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I thank you \\\\nall for coming. I am sitting here thinking that with all the \\\\nhearings we do, if you all could show up at every hearing and \\\\njust provide accounting expertise to help inform what is going \\\\non, it would be helpful.\\\\n    I was sitting here reflecting on this hearing. We are \\\\nalmost exactly a year to the day after John Ray testified \\\\nhere--it was December 13, 2022--on the FTX bankruptcy. I \\\\nremember him describing it as a paperless bankruptcy, and all \\\\nof our chins hit the floor when he said the whole thing was run \\\\non QuickBooks. Accountant nerds are smiling. We get the joke. I \\\\nsay that with love.\\\\n    I would like to just dig in a little bit on how accounting \\\\nstandards in the crypto industry have evolved since then. Ms. \\\\nWilliams, I would like to start with you, because the PCAOB \\\\nrecently issued an advisory warning investors to, ``exercise \\\\nextreme caution when relying on Proof of Reserves reports \\\\nprepared by third parties,&#x27;&#x27; and said that, ``Proof of Reserves \\\\nreports do not provide any meaningful assurance to investors or \\\\nthe public.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Could you just explain for us what Proof of Reserves \\\\nreports are and why you are concerned, and I would just add, \\\\nbefore you do that, that some of the public firms have also \\\\nraised these concerns. I think Mazars stopped auditing Binance \\\\nand crypto in 2022, because they said these were being \\\\nessentially presented as audits, but they were not. Can you \\\\nexplain what Proof of Reserves reports are and why they are not \\\\naudits?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you for that question. Proof of \\\\nReserves reports are reports that accounting firms may put out \\\\nregarding the amount of reserves that a particular entity has \\\\nat a particular point in time. They are in no way an audit, and \\\\nthey are definitely not a PCAOB audit, and we wanted to make \\\\nsure that we put out a bulletin to investors because some firms \\\\nthat are issuing Proof of Reserves reports may be registered \\\\nwith the PCAOB, and we did not want investors misled into \\\\nbelieving that those Proof of Reserves reports were PCAOB \\\\naudits.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay. And just so I understand, the Proof of \\\\nReserves does not say anything about liabilities. Correct?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. And it does not say anything about the controls \\\\nthat are in place?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Do they use standard accounting practices or do \\\\nthey rely on whatever practices the audited firm says to use?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. They do not use standard accounting \\\\npractices, and they are not in accordance with PCAOB standards \\\\nor rules.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay. I am glad I got that right. And I am glad \\\\nyou are calling it out. I think we are all watching what is \\\\ngoing on with Tether and some of the reports from the Attorney \\\\nGeneral that they may have lied about their reserves and are \\\\nstill essentially having these self-attested reports.\\\\n    Mr. Jones, in all your time as a public accountant, would \\\\nyou ever sign off on a balance sheet that did not include \\\\nliabilities, did not include reserves, and the auditing \\\\ncompanies set the rules of engagement?\\\\n    Mr. Jones. Not as a GAAP-compliant financial statement, I \\\\ndid not.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Me, neither.\\\\n    I want to shift to FASB. In September, you issued new \\\\nstandards that, if I understand it, require fair value \\\\nreporting for any crypto that is held on a balance sheet. Do I \\\\nunderstand right that exchanges are not covered by that rule?\\\\n    Mr. Jones. We issued, for a narrow subset of \\\\ncryptocurrency, rules that would require certain cryptocurrency \\\\nto be accounted for at fair value. That is because prior to \\\\nthat, we had two different standards, depending on what \\\\nindustry someone was in. For example, funds would have recorded \\\\ncrypto and any other investment at fair value, but for \\\\ncommercial-type companies, they would record it at lower \\\\nhistorical cost or fair value, effectively a mark to lowest \\\\nvalue.\\\\n    That is the standard-setting we did. It typically relates \\\\nto commercial companies. As far as the exchanges, unless they \\\\nqualified for some specialized accounting, it would have \\\\nencompassed them.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. I guess I ask that because going back to that \\\\nhearing we had a year ago, when FTX was issuing FTTs where they \\\\nwere both the issuer, and effectively, the valuer, could they \\\\nstill do that under these rules you have right now?\\\\n    Mr. Jones. I cannot speak on that fact pattern, because I \\\\ndo not know whether they applied GAAP, and if so, whether it \\\\nwas U.S. GAAP or international GAAP, or whether they applied it \\\\nwell.\\\\n    What I will tell you is that our standard excludes related \\\\nparty-issued tokens.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay. I am about out of time, but I would hope \\\\nthat this committee can look into this more, because we talk a \\\\nlot about how blockchain is trackable and auditable and, in \\\\ntheory, yes, but I think we have established that it is not a \\\\nbalance sheet. And particularly as we work on stablecoin \\\\nlegislation, given how big Tether is in this space, I am \\\\nconcerned that the accounting standards we have, through no \\\\nfault of you all, but we need to develop rules to make sure \\\\nthat we do not have this huge, unaudited or under-audited \\\\nbehemoth that is causing collateral damage in the system.\\\\n    Thank you all. I look forward to continuing to work on \\\\nthis, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. [presiding]. The gentleman yields back. The \\\\ngentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Hill, who is also the Chair of our \\\\nSubcommittee on Digital Assets, is now recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I am glad to have the panel \\\\nwith us today. Thank you very much. And Mr. Cook, I&#x27;m glad to \\\\nsee you, from your leadership position at FINRA.\\\\n    When Chair Gensler was here a few weeks ago, I had an \\\\nopportunity to talk to him about the Consolidated Audit Trail, \\\\nso I thought I would turn to you and start there. I know you \\\\nhave had several questions on it.\\\\n    Is it true that it 3,000 individuals have access to \\\\nquerying that database?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you, sir. My recollection is that was what \\\\nthe plan required the capacity to be. I do not have a number \\\\nfor you of how many; that would be something we would have to \\\\nget from CAT LLC.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Would you submit that to me in writing?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I will ask CAT LLC if we can get that, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. That would be very helpful. Thank you.\\\\n    What is your understanding, regardless of whether it is 1 \\\\nperson or 3,000 people, as to what the security clearance and \\\\nbackground check information of the people available to do that \\\\nquery would be? Is it just something standard, or is there \\\\nsomething special attached to that?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I can only speak for FINRA, which is one of the \\\\nagencies that can access the database, but we do have controls \\\\naround who is authorized to do it, what the circumstances would \\\\nbe, the training they need to go through, and then, what the \\\\nreasons would be for accessing it. There is a narrower set of \\\\naccess requirements around the customer database than there is \\\\naround the transaction database, which has anonymized \\\\ninformation. And I just want to distinguish that. I know that \\\\nyou know the difference, but the transaction database is \\\\nessential for market oversight. I really think it is the \\\\ncustomer account database where people are most concerned about \\\\nthe data privacy issue.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. You say it is essential for market oversight, but \\\\ndon&#x27;t the markets, the SROs and FINRA, also basically have \\\\naccess to daily market data?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Not on a consolidated basis. This was the problem \\\\nafter the flash crash. We have a market with----\\\\n    Mr. Hill. And how long ago was the flash crash?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thirteen years ago.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Okay. And we are still talking about it. But you \\\\ncould do a sweep exam if you were concerned about GameStop or \\\\nApple on any given day, in any given year, and get all the \\\\ntransaction data pretty much that same day, if not overnight. \\\\nRight?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. If we went back to pre-CAT days on the \\\\ntransaction, before we had a transaction database, it would \\\\ntake a lot longer than that to pull together. We do not even \\\\nhave the old Order Audit Trail System (OATS). I know you are \\\\nfamiliar with that. That has been decommissioned because of \\\\nCAT. So, the audit trail that used to exist before CAT does not \\\\nexist anymore, at least parts of it.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. During a conference in October, you mentioned \\\\nthat even your 80-year-old mom&#x27;s information would be stored on \\\\nthe Consolidated Audit Trail, despite the absence of any \\\\ninvestors being interested in seeing her manipulation of the \\\\nbroad market. To me, that sounds like it has a lot of data that \\\\nyou do not really need.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. That is a concern, I think, that we strike the \\\\nright balance. If we really wanted to go after, just sort of \\\\nlook for people who are able to move the market, large traders, \\\\nthat would be one way to scale back the scope of this database, \\\\njust focus on----\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Would you support that, if that is how it were \\\\nscaled back? Would that not be a fantastic way, just to even \\\\nuse it initially, instead of collecting all this data? The \\\\ngovernment does not have a great track record on maintaining \\\\nprivacy or stopping people from querying it or letting people \\\\nstring concepts together using big data analytics, and exposing \\\\nsomething that even you say is anonymous.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. It is obvious that if you do not collect it, you \\\\ncannot lose it. But whether it is the large trader approach, or \\\\nI think there may be some other approaches, too, that are worth \\\\nconsidering, we are getting smarter about this as we go \\\\nforward.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Do you have the authority to do that without \\\\nCongress telling you what to do directly?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. The CAT LLC, run by the exchanges and FINRA, can \\\\nengage with the SEC, but it would require SEC approval. It can \\\\nbe done without the authority of Congress but it would require \\\\nSEC approval.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. But do you think, just personally, as the CEO of \\\\nFINRA, that that would be a much more effective, narrowcasting \\\\nway to----\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I would love to work with the industry, the \\\\nexchanges, and the SEC to shrink that database down and still \\\\ntry to achieve the regulatory objectives.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Quickly turning to Prometheum, which is the only \\\\nSpecial Purpose Broker-Dealer licensed by FINRA, it is \\\\nessentially a storefront with nothing on the shelves which has \\\\nbeen approved but nothing is happening, did you work with the \\\\nSEC to approve that application, or did you do that solely \\\\ninside FINRA, in the normal process?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. It definitely followed the normal process. FINRA \\\\ndecides, ultimately, on the decision of whether to accept the \\\\nnew membership application. This particular application, \\\\nbecause it was under the SEC&#x27;s Special Purpose Broker-Dealer \\\\nno-action letter, like other applications we have had for that \\\\ntype--there are interpretive questions. To get interpretive \\\\nquestions about the SEC&#x27;s rules, we talked to them about \\\\nexactly what is required here, but ultimately, the decision is \\\\nFINRA&#x27;s to make.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. I may follow up with additional questions. I \\\\nthank the chairman for your discretion. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman \\\\nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Lynch, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Cook, you have \\\\nestablished, over at FINRA, a Crypto Hub, right?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. And you have what they call a Crypto Asset \\\\nInvestigation Team over there.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Just recently, we had Mr. Changpeng Zhao over at \\\\nBinance plead guilty, and I think he is a paying a $4.3-billion \\\\npenalty for violating anti-money laundering rules. And then, we \\\\nare waiting for the sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried. He bilked \\\\nat least a million different investors and stole $10 billion \\\\nworth of customer funds, and he was just convicted of 7 \\\\ndifferent counts of fraud. He is facing, I think, jail time of \\\\nup to 110 years. These are the two largest crypto exchanges in \\\\nthe world.\\\\n    Are there any lessons learned from those two cases, setting \\\\naside the part that there are no use cases for crypto except \\\\nfor trading crypto. FINRA&#x27;s core responsibility is to protect \\\\nconsumers and investors and the integrity of our markets, and I \\\\nam just concerned with the flagrant noncompliance going on in \\\\nthis space.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you for that important question, and in \\\\npart, the Crypto Hub and the Crypto Asset Investigation Team \\\\nand other teams within FINRA--the Hub is to pull them together \\\\nto make sure that we are doing that work effectively and that \\\\ndifferent parts of FINRA know what other parts of FINRA are \\\\ndoing.\\\\n    You asked about lessons learned. I think that there are \\\\nprobably many. But one of them is that the traditional rules \\\\naround securities and other regulated products are there for a \\\\nreally good reason, to make sure that assets are safe, that \\\\ncustomers know who is using them and why. As we go forward, I \\\\nthink those are important things to keep in mind.\\\\n    I want to point out that the SEC has provided some guidance \\\\nthat does allow a certain model of broker-dealer to engage in \\\\ncrypto asset securities activities. So, part of the Crypto Hub \\\\nand the other efforts you mentioned are really to make sure \\\\nthat we are prepared, as people apply, as they are entitled to, \\\\nto work under those no-action letters that were prepared to be \\\\nable to properly supervise them and protect investors.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. I appreciate that. There seems to be a gap, \\\\nthough. You have the ability to self-regulate members, but not \\\\naffiliates, is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Ms. Williams, I am just concerned. Let&#x27;s say an \\\\naffiliate of a regulated entity melts down. We have seen what \\\\nhappened with, I think it was Signature Bank, and Silicon \\\\nValley Bank, when there was a perception that the assets--and \\\\nyou talked about the Reserve reports--were not as valuable as \\\\nhad been posted or reported. When those assets dropped, there \\\\nwas a run on the bank. All the customers started to withdraw \\\\ntheir money, and there was a run on that bank.\\\\n    I am just wondering, with crypto being so volatile, does \\\\nthat present a risk to our system internally, our banking \\\\nsystem, and our economy, if outliers, people not being \\\\nregulated, crash and burn, can that come back on our banking \\\\nsystem if people perceive that there is no strength and not \\\\nenough assets in that bank to answer all claims?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you for that question. In June of 2022, \\\\nthe PCAOB put out an alert to auditors warning them of the \\\\nrisks that fluctuation in interest rates and volatility in \\\\ncertain markets could have, and we also have prioritized the \\\\ninspections of audit engagements involving digital assets and \\\\nfinancial institutions that may be subject to interest rate \\\\nfluctuations, increased inflation, and volatility in digital \\\\nassets. Those are all areas of focus for the PCAOB.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Great. And I would just ask this, and I will \\\\ntake the answer offline, if you could recommend changes to \\\\naddress the special nature of the risks that are being \\\\npresented by a widening use of crypto, that would be very \\\\nhelpful to the committee.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize \\\\nmyself for 5 minutes of questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cook, we have talked about the CAT quite a bit already, \\\\nand again, in the comments you made in October, you were highly \\\\ncritical of the CAT. And I understand you told my colleague, \\\\nMr. Lucas, that the consortium proposed a fee allocation to \\\\ncover the cost of the CAT. However, given your recent comments, \\\\nwhom do you believe will ultimately pay for the cost of the \\\\nCAT?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you for that question, sir. I would be \\\\nspeculating a little bit, but if this fee proposal goes forward \\\\nthe way it is designed, there is allocation to the SROs, and \\\\nthen there is allocation to the members. I think in many cases \\\\nit is likely to be passed on if it can be. Ultimately, I think, \\\\ndirectly or indirectly, it is very likely that this will be \\\\npaid for by investors and by others down the chain.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. It will trickle down and be passed on to the \\\\ninvestors. That is what is likely to happen.\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I would assume that is what is likely to happen.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. In your view, does the CAT offer \\\\nimproved investor protection significant enough to warrant the \\\\nongoing expenses required to maintain this database?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I think that is an excellent question, sir. I do \\\\nnot know how we do surveillance today in this market. We have \\\\n24 different securities exchanges. You have lots of alternative \\\\ntrading system, et cetera, et cetera. How do we surveil for \\\\nmisconduct across those markets without some type of audit \\\\ntrail to be able to do that? That does not mean that we do not \\\\nhave to be laser-focused on costs, but I think that is a really \\\\ngood area for us to continue to be focused on.\\\\n    But the average daily trading volume in the U.S. is $600 \\\\nbillion a day, so that is a lot of money that is at stake here. \\\\nAnd I think investors probably expect that regulators are \\\\nlooking at what is happening across the markets, and that is \\\\nreally the tool that the CAT is intended to provide, the \\\\ntransaction database of the CAT.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. It was also reported that you said it is not \\\\ntoo late to do the right thing regarding the CAT, to fix some \\\\nof the underlying problems. Can you explain the right thing \\\\nthat Congress or the SEC should do to fix the CAT and to \\\\nprotect the investors?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Yes, I think that is from the same speech where I \\\\nwas sharing a conversation I had with my mother, who shared \\\\nmotherly advice that it is never too late to do the right \\\\nthing. And in that context, it was about if we are collecting \\\\nmore data than we need to about individuals in the marketplace, \\\\nwe can always change the rules and find a better balance. And I \\\\nthink the conversation can go in that direction, about, is \\\\nthere a better way to be able to make sure we are doing the \\\\nregulatory work we need to do and investors expect us to do, \\\\nbut reduce our data footprint if we can?\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Any suggestions?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I think there have been some ideas that have been \\\\nworked on by the SROs over the years, including one that \\\\ninvolved a request response system, so you only pull in the \\\\ndata when you need it. I think now that we have more experience \\\\nwith the database there are some other ideas about how you \\\\ncould only go out and get the information when you actually \\\\nneed it, so that you are not pulling it in up front. I think \\\\nthose are worth exploring because I think they could help \\\\nbridge the difference between the data use cases and the data \\\\nprivacy issue.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you very much. Chairwoman Williams, \\\\nyour July opinion article in The Wall Street Journal stated \\\\nthat the audit quality is trending down for the second year in \\\\na row. How does the PCAOB define audit quality and where can we \\\\nfind it? And when you said that the audit quality is trending \\\\ndown, does that mean that there has been an increase in \\\\nincorrect financial statements? Can you please help us \\\\nunderstand the interplay between audit quality, as the Board \\\\ndefines it, and the accuracy of the issuer financial statement?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. That you for that question. We define audit \\\\nquality by looking at the Part I.A deficiencies in our \\\\ninspection reports, and those are deficiencies that are so \\\\nsignificant that our staff does not believe that the auditor \\\\nhas sufficient appropriate audit evidence to sign their \\\\nopinion. A deficiency does not necessarily mean that the \\\\nfinancial statements are inaccurate, but it does mean that \\\\nthere is a risk that if those statements are inaccurate, the \\\\nauditor would not find it.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Is your definition of audit quality public? \\\\nIs that written down, or is it just----\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Yes. We note that when we talk about audit \\\\nquality, I always reference that that is, in my opinion, based \\\\non the Part I.A deficiencies. There are other measures that \\\\ncould be used, but we think deficiency rates are a good way to \\\\nmeasure audit quality because our inspectors are in there \\\\nactually looking at the work that was done by auditors.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. I would like to take more time, \\\\nbut I think the Chair would be very mad at me, so I yield back.\\\\n    I now recognize the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Nunn, for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I always appreciate a good Chair who is so fair. \\\\nThank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    As I highlighted during the appropriations amendment \\\\nprocess with Chairwoman Wagner, the Public Company Accounting \\\\nOversight Board (PCAOB) arguably has gone completely rogue \\\\nunder Chairman Gensler, by firing all of the previous Chairs \\\\nand replacing them with a board, at the entire direction \\\\nprimarily of two Senators, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\\\\n    In a recent proposal from earlier this year, Chair \\\\nWilliams, you, as the the newly-replaced Board lead, imposed an \\\\nobligation on auditors to detect and evaluate the company&#x27;s \\\\nnoncompliance with any law or regulation that, ``could \\\\nreasonably have a material effect on a financial statement.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Chair Williams, I would like to discuss with you today the \\\\nPCAOB under your leadership, and specifically, Noncompliance \\\\nwith Laws and Regulations. I have heard from several of the \\\\nsmall public firms in my district that this proposal could \\\\ntriple their annual costs, roughly $55 billion a year in total, \\\\nwith some even estimating over $80 billion--that&#x27;s, \\\\n``billion,&#x27;&#x27; with a, ``b.&#x27;&#x27; Given that these businesses are \\\\nalready subject to highly complex and technical laws and \\\\nregulations, both at the Federal and the State level, the \\\\nvagueness and the complex language in your proposals has \\\\nclearly created ambiguity that will only lead to adverse \\\\noutcomes for U.S. businesses and increase the legal compliance \\\\ncosts that they are incurring.\\\\n    I want to begin with this. Chair Williams, how does the \\\\nBoard intend to enhance audit quality, as you stated in The \\\\nWall Street Journal op-ed from this summer, while at the same \\\\ntime reshaping the role of auditors and extending their \\\\nresponsibility beyond financial statement audits?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. Thank you for that question. The \\\\nNoncompliance with Laws and Regulations right now is just a \\\\nproposal, and we are very much looking forward to public \\\\ncomments. We have received a number of comments, and we are \\\\ngoing to be holding a public roundtable----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. We have heard that, Chair Williams. I appreciate \\\\nthat. Let&#x27;s go deeper then, because now you are asking for \\\\nfeedback. So, despite the complex and specialized nature of \\\\nyour agency&#x27;s work, is it correct that the Board currently has \\\\nonly two CPAs?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. That is correct. Under Sarbanes-Oxley, \\\\nCongress, in its wisdom, determined that----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. And of those two CPAs, is it also correct that \\\\nthey voted against this?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. And roughly 80 percent of the firms who commented \\\\nupon your rules are against this. Is that correct?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. We have received a number of comments, both \\\\nin favor of the proposal and against it.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. It was 20 percent in favor, and 80 percent \\\\nopposed.\\\\n    Ms. Williams. I have not done that calculation.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I would hope that you would, because now you are \\\\nasking people to come together for a roundtable. Why did you \\\\nnot do these roundtables prior to writing this rule?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. We did. For the past 19 years, we have \\\\nreceived feedback from stakeholders on Noncompliance with Laws \\\\nand Regulations (NOCLAR), and a majority of our staff are CPAs, \\\\nand they provided the recommendation on NOCLAR on which the \\\\nboard voted.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I appreciate that. But at the end of the day, the \\\\nonly two CPAs on your Board are opposed to this. You are now \\\\ndoing roundtables because Chairwoman Wagner asked you about \\\\nfeedback, and so you have started this new process of sitting \\\\npeople around the table. Yes, we have always received feedback. \\\\nThis is not new. But having to do the roundtables is a direct \\\\nreflection of the fact that you are having a full-scale \\\\nrebellion on your rules coming forward.\\\\n    Wouldn&#x27;t you press other members of the Board--let&#x27;s have a \\\\nconversation here on this--you and the other members of the \\\\nBoard decided to press forward when the real accountants in the \\\\nroom told you this was wrong. Why did you make that decision?\\\\n    Ms. Williams. We received a proposal from, and a \\\\nrecommendation from the CPAs on our staff, and the majority of \\\\nour staff are CPAs. Many of them have been working with this \\\\nstandard for years, and have seen ways that it needs to be \\\\nimproved, in addition to the fact that our stakeholder groups, \\\\nour advisory groups have, for the past 19 years, raised issues \\\\nwith regard to the current standard. So, we are just trying to \\\\nbe responsive to feedback, because our ultimate goal is to make \\\\nsure that we get the standard right for the protection of \\\\ninvestors.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Chair Williams, I think that you need to start \\\\nlistening to your auditors who are telling you that this needs \\\\nreform. It is costing all of us more money at our local and \\\\nsmall business level. And let&#x27;s get one thing straight: \\\\nAuditors are not attorneys, nor should they have to be. By no \\\\nmeans, should they be expected to function as law enforcement \\\\nagents in many of the ways that you are asking them to do. This \\\\nproposal diverts auditors&#x27; attention and resources away from \\\\nthe rigorous evaluation of financial statements, which serve as \\\\nthe backbone for our capital markets across everyone&#x27;s \\\\ndistricts and their constituencies, and forces them to become \\\\nmore of a compliance attorney, and ultimately, an enforcer.\\\\n    Please listen to your auditors. Please listen to the more \\\\nthan 80 percent of businesses and community members who have \\\\ncome back and asked you to change these rules before you put \\\\nthem into effect.\\\\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \\\\nrecognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Lawler, for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Cook, my \\\\ncolleagues and I have repeatedly asked you and the SEC Chairman \\\\nwhat, if anything, the SEC and FINRA are doing to address the \\\\nthreats imposed by Chinese-owned broker-dealers to retail \\\\ninvestors in the United States. These firms are regulated by \\\\nthe SEC and FINRA, and yet some of them reportedly have close \\\\nties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The threats include \\\\nthe potential that millions of Americans&#x27; personal and \\\\nfinancial information could be easily exfiltrated to entities \\\\nor individuals connected to the CCP as they increasingly \\\\npressure companies to pursue the CCP&#x27;s goals and to participate \\\\nin China&#x27;s espionage.\\\\n    Generally, Chinese companies are required by Chinese law to \\\\nshare data with the Chinese Government. These companies present \\\\nsubstantial risks to U.S. individual privacy and national \\\\nsecurity.\\\\n    This threat needs to be examined, when you consider that at \\\\nleast one of these companies reported employees and operations \\\\nin Hunan Province, China. On top of that, Massachusetts \\\\nregulators recently settled a case with Webull, stating that up \\\\nuntil February 2021, the firm did not have a formally-\\\\ndesignated compliance department.\\\\n    Do you recognize the potential threats to American \\\\ninvestors posed by broker-dealers like Webull, Moomoo, and \\\\nPrometheum, with reported ties to the CCP, and have you taken \\\\nany action whatsoever to address these threats?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. Thank you, Congressman, for that important \\\\nquestion. We recognize the concerns that have been raised. We \\\\nappreciate the interest in the oversight, and we also \\\\nappreciate the correspondence we have had with a number of \\\\nMembers of Congress on this front.\\\\n    FINRA&#x27;s role is to make sure our member firms comply with \\\\nU.S. securities laws and with FINRA&#x27;s rules, under the \\\\nsupervision of the SEC. We don&#x27;t actually regulate direct or \\\\nindirect owners, but when people apply to be FINRA members, we \\\\ncertainly look at who are those direct and indirect owners, \\\\nwhat kind of connections might they have to the broker-dealer, \\\\nand what kind of risks, if any, might that present. But there \\\\nis no flat-out prohibition on direct or indirect owners from \\\\nany particular country or any particular party unless they are \\\\nsanctioned. And we feel like that is a Federal regulatory \\\\ndecision, not something for a private SRO to make. But we are \\\\ncertainly sensitive to those concerns.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. I will ask you a simple question: Can FINRA \\\\ndecide tomorrow to send its small army of examiners and \\\\nenforcement lawyers into Mainland China and investigate \\\\nWebull&#x27;s registered representatives and brokerage operations \\\\nlocated there, or use its enforcement authority to compel the \\\\nproduction of documents maintained by Webull in China?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. FINRA&#x27;s authority allows it to examine people and \\\\nto collect data, and----\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Would you be able to send them to Mainland \\\\nChina to do that?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. We have the authority to do that. It would \\\\nrequire them to present where they are, and if they do not, if \\\\nthey do not comply with----\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Have you done it?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. We have sought information.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Have you sent investigators to Mainland China?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I am not aware of us actually sending anyone \\\\nover.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. This begs another simple question: If FINRA \\\\ncannot go to China directly, or at least has not taken the \\\\nopportunity to do so, even though you just seemed to indicate \\\\nyou have the authority to do so, to inspect and investigate the \\\\nemployees and operations of these brokers located there, or \\\\ncompel production of documents kept by these firms in China, \\\\nhow can FINRA assure American investors that these firms are \\\\nactually complying with financial rules?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. The books and records of these broker-dealers--we \\\\nunderstand that the SEC&#x27;s rules are maintained in the U.S., the \\\\nfull scope. So, we do examine for compliance with the books and \\\\nrecords that we have, and look at things like, how is \\\\ninformation being shared, what kind of controls are there \\\\naround that, and so forth.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Do you have a high level of confidence in the \\\\ninformation that is kept here in the United States versus what \\\\nWebull has in China?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I cannot speak to any particular firm, but I know \\\\nthat this is something that our staff would be looking at. They \\\\nwould be looking for compliance with Reg S-P on that front, \\\\nwhich is the Gramm--\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. But how can you look at it if you have not sent \\\\nanybody to Mainland China to go look at it?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. We can look at what information is available \\\\nwhere. These operations that you are referring to are very \\\\nlimited in scope, in terms of the number of our overall \\\\nmembership. And I am not trying to diminish the issue. I am \\\\njust saying we take a risk----\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. They may be limited in scope of your overall \\\\nmembership, but I think we can all recognize that there is a \\\\ngreater threat to the general public in terms of their privacy \\\\nand information from these companies that operate in Mainland \\\\nChina. Do you not agree with that?\\\\n    Mr. Cook. I think there are some jurisdictions that we are \\\\nmore concerned about, and we absolutely, if we find they are \\\\nnot complying with the U.S. rules, will initiate enforcement \\\\nproceedings.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I would like to thank our witnesses for their testimony \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    The Chair notes that some Members may have additional \\\\nquestions for this panel, which they may wish to submit in \\\\nwriting. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open \\\\nfor 5 legislative days for Members to submit written questions \\\\nto these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. \\\\nAlso, without objection, Members will have 5 legislative days \\\\nto submit extraneous materials to the Chair for inclusion in \\\\nthe record. I ask our witnesses to please respond as promptly \\\\nas you can.\\\\n    The hearing is now adjourned.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 4:19 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.] \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n                            A P P E N D I X\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                           December 12, 2023 \\\\n                           \\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73193/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"12/08/2023\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"CONNECTING COMMUNITIES: BUILDING INNOVATION ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS AMERICA\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73193, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"Financial Services\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                    CONNECTING COMMUNITIES: BUILDING\\\\n                  INNOVATION ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS AMERICA\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                             FIELD HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                    SUBCOMMITTEE ON DIGITAL ASSETS,\\\\n                         FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY,\\\\n                             AND INCLUSION\\\\n\\\\n                                 OF THE\\\\n\\\\n                    COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES\\\\n\\\\n                     U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             FIRST SESSION                                               \\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                            DECEMBER 8, 2023\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n       Printed for the use of the Committee on Financial Services\\\\n\\\\n                           Serial No. 118-62\\\\n                           \\\\n       \\\\n       \\\\n       \\\\n                           \\\\n             [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] \\\\n                           \\\\n                           \\\\n                           \\\\n                           \\\\n                                ______\\\\n\\\\n                  U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE\\\\n\\\\n55-206 PDF                WASHINGTON : 2024 \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                 HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES\\\\n\\\\n               PATRICK McHENRY, North Carolina, Chairman\\\\n\\\\nFRANK D.

The Subcommittee on Digital Assets, \\\\nFinancial Technology, and Inclusion will come to order.\\\\n    I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here, and I \\\\nwant to thank my colleagues for coming to Little Rock for this \\\\ngreat opportunity.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for 4 minutes for an opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    In the House today, in the Financial Services Committee, \\\\nthis is a big day, not only because we are having a hearing \\\\nhere in Arkansas, my home State, but it is also the first field \\\\nhearing of this Congress for the Financial Services Committee. \\\\nIn my view, there is no better way to start the committee&#x27;s \\\\nfield work than by examining the benefits that financial \\\\ntechnology is bringing to communities and Americans across our \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    As history has shown, financial innovation is the lifeblood \\\\nof the United States and has been, certainly, for the past 75 \\\\nyears. As fintech continues to expand and develop, we have \\\\nreached a critical inflection point where it is embedded in \\\\ncommunities across the United States, including right here in \\\\nLittle Rock. In Arkansas alone, companies raised a record $201 \\\\nmillion in venture capital in 2022, an 87 percent jump from \\\\n$107 million in 2021.\\\\n    Here at The Venture Center, 40 percent of the companies \\\\nthat participated in FIS&#x27;s Fintech Accelerator in 2022 were run \\\\nby women. This growth is impressive, and we would be remiss not \\\\nto give credit to the efforts of all of the witnesses sitting \\\\nbefore us today.\\\\n    Because of Commissioner Marshall, Arkansas banks of all \\\\nsizes are able to safely and successfully integrate fintech \\\\nproducts and services into their offerings for customers. \\\\nBecause of Arthur and Joel&#x27;s collaboration, up-and-coming \\\\nfintech companies like our guests&#x27; are able to build and \\\\ndevelop in an environment that wants them to succeed and is \\\\nwilling to provide the necessary guidance and resources to \\\\nensure that success.\\\\n    And last, but most certainly not least, because of Mr. \\\\nLoganathan and those like him, the benefits of fintech know no \\\\nboundaries here in the United States.\\\\n    With our deep roots in fintech, including the founding of \\\\nSystematics over 5 decades ago, I am proud of the fintech hub \\\\nthat Little Rock has become, and I am eager to share my State&#x27;s \\\\nprogress with my great friends and colleagues who are with me \\\\ntoday; Mike Flood from Nebraska; and Wiley Nickel from North \\\\nCarolina. Also, I want to say greetings to my friend, Stephen \\\\nLynch, who is the ranking member of this subcommittee, and is \\\\nfrom Boston. He is hosting a Cabinet Member in Boston today so \\\\nhe could not be with us.\\\\n    With that, I thank my friends for being with us, and I look \\\\nforward to the testimony of the witnesses. And I now recognize \\\\nMr. Nickel for 5 minutes for his opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thank you so much, Chairman Hill, for convening \\\\nour subcommittee here in Little Rock. It is a wonderful \\\\npleasure and an amazing honor to be here in Little Rock for \\\\nthis field hearing.\\\\n    Our focus today is on innovation, and I am very proud of my \\\\nState, North Carolina. It is something that we do very well. My \\\\ndistrict benefits heavily from North Carolina&#x27;s Research \\\\nTriangle Park. It is a prominent, high-tech research and \\\\ndevelopment center renowned for its concentration of innovative \\\\ncompanies and academic collaborations.\\\\n    Thanks to Chairman Hill, I have learned that Little Rock is \\\\nemerging as a significant innovation hub for fintech companies, \\\\nattracting a diverse range of both startups and established \\\\nfirms with its supportive business environment and growing \\\\ntechnology ecosystem. Much of this is thanks to our host today, \\\\nThe Venture Center of Little Rock. I am very much looking \\\\nforward to hearing more about the work you do here.\\\\n    Fintech companies are vital in driving economic growth by \\\\nintroducing innovative financial services and technologies that \\\\nenhance efficiency and accessibility in the financial sector. \\\\nTheir emphasis on digital solutions democratizes financial \\\\nservices, allowing underserved and unbanked populations to \\\\naccess banking loans and investment opportunities, thus \\\\npromoting financial inclusion.\\\\n    Furthermore, fintechs stimulate job creation and foster a \\\\ncompetitive environment that encourages traditional financial \\\\ninstitutions to innovate and improve their services, \\\\ncontributing to overall economic development. As members of the \\\\nFinancial Services Committee, it is our responsibility to \\\\nfoster an environment where fintechs can thrive while never \\\\nlosing sight of consumer protection.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Flood, you \\\\nare now recognized for 1 minute.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start by \\\\ncommending the Chair for having a field hearing here in Little \\\\nRock. It is nice to get out of Washington, D.C., and actually \\\\nsee where the rubber meets the road.\\\\n    This City, as I understand it, is steeped in history, a \\\\ncultural melting pot, and is the perfect example of the kind of \\\\ncommunity that punches above its weight when it comes to its \\\\nspirit of economic innovation.\\\\n    I was at your museum last night, your arts center, and it \\\\nwas unbelievable. We walked through the collection. We had a \\\\nwonderful dinner. At the time I was there, there were different \\\\nevents going on. There was a Young President&#x27;s Organization \\\\n(YPO) group, there was a concert, there was our dinner, and \\\\nthere were others, and people were mixing and enjoying life. I \\\\ndo think that having a vibrant arts culture, with public art, \\\\nand the effort to bring density into your downtown, are some of \\\\nthe key hallmarks of a community that wants to grow in this \\\\nspace.\\\\n    We are here today because towns like Little Rock, Arkansas, \\\\nshould get every single opportunity to partake in the \\\\ninnovation economy. Innovation should not just happen in \\\\nAustin, Boston, and San Jose; it belongs in every single State \\\\nin America. In fact, if we do not get into innovation, we will \\\\nbe left behind. So, the efforts of our chairman here, your \\\\ncommunity leadership and businesses, and most importantly, \\\\nentrepreneurs, are very important.\\\\n    Today, too many young people are taught not to take a risk. \\\\nWe have them in sports from 6 in the morning until 10 at night, \\\\nand they know what they are told to do by the time they are 19-\\\\nyears-old. They do not ever think about taking risks. And the \\\\nreality is that 8 to 8\\\\\\\\1/2\\\\\\\\ out of 10 startups fail, and we \\\\nneed to remind people in America that there is merit in \\\\nfailure. It means you tried, it means you learned something, \\\\nand you can use those failures to become successful down the \\\\nroad.\\\\n    Projects like this make a big difference, and if you are a \\\\nsmart kid growing up in Arkansas or Nebraska, we need towns \\\\nlike this to take those smart kids who come off the farm or \\\\nfrom a rural area and bring them to a town like Little Rock and \\\\nlet them thrive.\\\\n    I always tell people in Nebraska that we raise the gold \\\\nthat the rest of America wants to hire as a CEO. You do the \\\\nsame here in Arkansas. You raise these young people with \\\\nintegrity, you raise them with honesty, and you teach them so \\\\nwell in your schools that in towns like Little Rock, or maybe \\\\nin their hometown, they can start a business and they can \\\\nthrive. We just need to make sure that the young people of \\\\nArkansas, like Nebraska, know that there are opportunities for \\\\nthem in a place like this.\\\\n    I will close by again thanking the chairman. He came to \\\\nLincoln, Nebraska, to headline my Flyover Fintech event in \\\\nAugust at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and he gave a \\\\ndynamic speech. I think, underpinned by what he has seen here \\\\nin Little Rock, it was right on par for what we were looking \\\\nfor. And I am excited to be in Little Rock. I love this.\\\\n    The other thing I would say is that this does not happen \\\\nbecause you followed some checklist. This is very hard to \\\\ncreate, and there is no roadmap for this. You have to invest in \\\\nentrepreneurs, you have to find the capital for at-risk \\\\nbusiness ventures, you have to put all the people in the same \\\\nroom, and ultimately, the entrepreneurs have to run it. And I \\\\nam hopeful that today--and I am sure I will--I will learn all \\\\nabout how you have accomplished this and learn what it is \\\\nproducing for the good people of Arkansas.\\\\n    With that, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Today, we welcome the testimony of; Commissioner Susannah \\\\nMarshall, the 22nd Commissioner of the Arkansas State Bank \\\\nDepartment, and the 19th Arkansas Securities Commissioner; Mr. \\\\nArthur Orduna, the executive director of The Venture Center \\\\nhere in Little Rock, which is an organization dedicated to \\\\nhelping entrepreneurs and startups become high-growth \\\\nbusinesses, and is our gracious host today; Mr. Joel Wheelis, \\\\nthe senior vice president and head of products and services for \\\\nbanking at FIS Global--he has his FIS green tie on today--a \\\\nleading provider of fintech software solutions for banks and \\\\npayments and investments, and also partners with The Venture \\\\nCenter, and is the host of our FIS Fintech Accelerator Program \\\\nhere in Little Rock; and Mr. Ravi Loganathan, the head of \\\\nfinancial institution services at Sardine, and the president of \\\\nthe SardineX Consortium, a real-time fraud database that brings \\\\ntogether a variety of entities in the financial services space \\\\nto combat and share data about fraud on platforms--his \\\\ncompanies are also graduates of the Fintech Accelerator, so \\\\nthat is to be congratulated.\\\\n    We thank each of you for taking the time to be with us \\\\ntoday.

Thank you, and good morning. Chairman Hill, \\\\nRepresentative Flood, and Representative Nickels, it is my \\\\nsincere privilege to speak with you today. I would like to \\\\nthank the House Financial Services Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on \\\\nDigital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion for \\\\nconvening this important hearing.\\\\n    My name is Susannah Marshall, and I serve as the Bank \\\\nCommissioner for the Arkansas State Bank Department, and the \\\\nSecurities Commissioner for the Arkansas Securities Department. \\\\nI appreciate the opportunity to share how States, particularly \\\\nArkansas, are actively engaged with all stakeholders in the \\\\nfinancial technology landscape.\\\\n    As a State regulator, I have a unique vantage point to both \\\\nthe bank and nonbank industries. In Arkansas, we continue to \\\\ndevelop and enhance our existing relationships with these \\\\nindustries in order to gain further awareness around innovation \\\\ntechnology within the financial services arena. We foster \\\\nopportunities for outreach and partnership with discussions on \\\\nfintech firms and third-party providers. And lastly, we strive \\\\nto work collaboratively within the regulatory industry to \\\\nachieve consistency and provide resources to create thoughtful \\\\nand appropriate oversight for the future of financial \\\\ntechnology. Creating an environment of responsible innovation \\\\nenhances local economic development, market competition, and \\\\nsafety for consumers.\\\\n    My agency has made financial innovation in our institutions \\\\na topic of discussion. We believe it is important to encourage \\\\nour regulated entities to explore and adopt innovative \\\\ntechnology in a strategic, safe, and thoughtful manner. State \\\\nregulators understand the significant role technology plays in \\\\nbanks&#x27; abilities to provide excellent products and services and \\\\nmeet the needs and demands of all customers, including both \\\\nbusinesses and individuals.\\\\n    The State Bank Department, at the request of our banks, has \\\\njoined in direct conversations with banks and fintech firms, \\\\nwhich the bank is evaluating for business opportunities and \\\\npartnerships. We wholly believe these introductory \\\\nconversations are impactful and yield positive results for all \\\\nparties, and we actively support this engagement.\\\\n    Across the country, other State regulators are holding tech \\\\nsprint events, where interested parties collaborate on ways to \\\\ndevelop a longstanding relationship with firms such as The \\\\nVenture Center, and other partnerships such as the FIS Fintech \\\\nAccelerator, hosted here in Little Rock, as well as in other \\\\ncities and States in this country. I, along with other key \\\\nmembers from the State Bank Department, have participated in \\\\nThe Venture Center&#x27;s Fintech Summit, which has spotlighted the \\\\ngreat work and success happening within the fintech sector.\\\\n    In terms of regulatory collaboration, I have had the \\\\npleasure of joining other regulators as participants in The \\\\nVenture Center&#x27;s early audiences, availing all of us with the \\\\nopportunity to learn more about the program and its \\\\nparticipants and affording us the ability to offer critical \\\\nfeedback and thoughtful suggestions on how these products and \\\\nservices may ultimately become part of an institution&#x27;s \\\\nportfolio.\\\\n    As incubators of innovation, States have experience with \\\\ndeveloping regulatory approaches for emerging financial \\\\nservices. For example, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors \\\\n(CSBS) formed several advisory and working groups involving \\\\nfintech industry representatives to enhance State regulator \\\\ncoordination and focus on risks, while minimizing regulatory \\\\nburden.\\\\n    Since 2019, I have served on the CSBS Fintech and \\\\nInnovation Steering Group (FISG) with State bank regulators \\\\nfrom across the country. These group members meet regularly to \\\\ndiscuss fintech and other financial services innovations and \\\\nhow best to help shape potential bank and nonbank regulation.\\\\n    In June of this year, the Federal bank regulators issued \\\\njoint interagency guidance for banks managing the risk of \\\\nthird-party relationships, including those with fintechs. This \\\\nguidance is aimed at eliminating unnecessary confusion by \\\\nharmonizing supervisory views on relationships with third-party \\\\nvendors. State regulators are well-positioned to marry the \\\\nconsumer benefit of new technologies with consumer protection, \\\\nand we must not be impediments to safe, sound, and thoughtful \\\\nimplementation and adoption of financial technology by the \\\\nindustry. With the majority of customer-facing technology being \\\\noutsourced to third-party vendors, this work is more important \\\\nthan ever.\\\\n    In closing, the financial services industry has been and \\\\nshould continue to be the foundation for innovation. \\\\nTechnological innovations can increase a bank&#x27;s ability to \\\\nreach and serve the needs of unbanked or underbanked consumers \\\\nand communities. And as we witnessed in the recent pandemic, \\\\nthere was an accelerated utilization of technology for \\\\nincreased access to financial services.\\\\n    I am very proud of the important work that is happening \\\\nhere in Arkansas, specifically at The Venture Center, and how \\\\nit serves as a model for financial services innovation across \\\\nthe country. With a rich history in entrepreneurship and \\\\neconomic development, a legacy of innovation and financial \\\\ntechnology, a favorable business environment, and a thriving \\\\nbanking community, it is no surprise that Arkansas is home to \\\\nits own Fintech Accelerator.\\\\n    On behalf of the State regulatory and financial services \\\\nsystems, I want to thank you for the invitation to speak, and I \\\\nlook forward to answering any questions you may have.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Commissioner Marshall can be \\\\nfound on page 34 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you, Commissioner.\\\\n    Mr. Orduna, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your \\\\noral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n      STATEMENT OF ARTHUR ORDUNA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, \\\\n                    THE VENTURE CENTER\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Hill, \\\\nRepresentative Flood, Representative Nickel, and members of the \\\\nsubcommittee. My name is Arthur Orduna. It is my privilege as \\\\nexecutive director of The Venture Center to give this statement \\\\non the importance of building and supporting innovation and \\\\nentrepreneurship ecosystems at the local, State, and regional \\\\nlevels in America, with Arkansas and the work of The Venture \\\\nCenter and its partners as an example of public-private \\\\ncollaboration and initiatives that generate meaningful and \\\\nmeasurable economic benefits to communities and businesses. I \\\\nwould like to give a shout-out to my teammates who have made \\\\nthis hearing possible today, and thank them for all of their \\\\nhard work.\\\\n    The Venture Center is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) Entrepreneur \\\\nSupport Organization (ESO) based in Little Rock, Arkansas. We \\\\nwere founded 10 years ago with the mission of accelerating \\\\nsuccess for startup founders, small business owners, and \\\\ncorporate innovators through entrepreneurship programs, \\\\nplatforms, and partnerships. Our vision is to help raise \\\\nArkansas to regional, national, and global leadership in \\\\nentrepreneurship and economic prosperity.\\\\n    Over the last 10 years, early-stage and growth companies \\\\nwhich have gone through our startup and business-driven \\\\naccelerator programs--especially through our Fintech \\\\nAccelerators which are done in partnership with FIS and \\\\ncommunity, State, regional, and national banks--have raised \\\\nmore than $2.5 billion of private capital, with an average \\\\nfunding raise of $17 million. Despite capital market \\\\nchallenges, more than 85 percent of those companies are still \\\\nin operation or have been acquired by entities still operating \\\\ntoday. I welcome four of them here today as well.\\\\n    Our programs and their participants have generated more \\\\nthan $30 million in documented economic benefit to the State of \\\\nArkansas, including more than $1 million in tourism for central \\\\nArkansas and Little Rock. We have helped with the launch and \\\\nrelocation of technology-based companies in Arkansas, including \\\\n10 in the fintech sector. This has led to the creation of more \\\\nthan 180 new, high-wage technology jobs in the State. Just this \\\\npast year, we have congratulated two of our program alumni \\\\ncompanies which were recently purchased by private equity for \\\\n$30 million, and $300 million, respectively. As a result of our \\\\nprograms and activities, we have created a network of more than \\\\n16,000 individuals, agencies, and companies who continue to \\\\nsupport us.\\\\n    This last point is paramount: We could not execute our \\\\nmission without partnerships from multiple sources. Critical \\\\nsupport to help achieve these results has come from the \\\\ncorporate sector, as exemplified by our partnership with Little \\\\nRock-founded FIS, and banks such as Simmons Bank and Arvest \\\\nBank; from the municipal level, as exemplified by our \\\\npartnerships with the City of Little Rock, the Mayor&#x27;s Office, \\\\nand the Chamber of Commerce; and the State level, as \\\\nexemplified by our partnership with the Department of Commerce, \\\\nand especially the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. \\\\nWelcome to all members here today.\\\\n    We are also grateful for the support of our Federal \\\\nofficials and elected Representatives serving the people and \\\\ncommunities of Arkansas, including the encouragement and \\\\nsupport of Chairman Hill, a former Arkansas banker.\\\\n    I respectfully offer the following recommendations based on \\\\nthe experiences and challenges we have lived through here at \\\\nThe Venture Center. First, to other ESOs around the country, \\\\ntake a portfolio and business-driven approach to fostering \\\\ninnovation at the community level. In our view, a healthy \\\\ncommunity ecosystem comprises a pipeline across all of these. \\\\nThis has been a key reason for the success of our Fintech \\\\nAccelerators.\\\\n    Next, to other State, county, and municipal governments and \\\\nagencies, improve the level of innovation and entrepreneurship \\\\nby improving our communities&#x27; quality of life. Great \\\\ncommunities attract and grow great people. It is simple and it \\\\nis true. My wife and I are from Des Moines, Iowa, and we \\\\nstrongly believe that the strong economic performance in \\\\ncentral Iowa over the last several decades is based on the fact \\\\nthat it is a really good place to live and grow. The same is \\\\ntrue of Little Rock, and Arkansas in general.\\\\n    Finally, to Federal Government legislators and agencies, \\\\nwork proactively and collaboratively to think through how to \\\\nhelp at your level, with a commitment of multiyear funding to \\\\nnonprofit Entrepreneur Support Organizations (ESOs). While this \\\\nis a self-serving recommendation, my request encompasses all of \\\\nthe ESOs that share our mission in Arkansas, such as The \\\\nInnovation Hub, Startup Junkie, Conductor, and others, as well \\\\nas ESOs in the other 49 States. I suggest as a starting point, \\\\nperhaps with this subcommittee in a leading role, to begin a \\\\ndialogue with the ESOs and their key partners in your \\\\nrespective constituencies on identifying actionable initiative \\\\nthat may already be in flight.\\\\n    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Orduna can be found on page \\\\n43 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Wheelis, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your \\\\noral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n       STATEMENT OF JOEL WHEELIS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, \\\\n            PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR BANKING, FIS\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Wheelis. Chairman Hill and members of the subcommittee, \\\\nmy name is Joel Wheelis, and it is my privilege as senior vice \\\\npresident of products and services for banking at FIS to \\\\ntestify before you today to highlight the importance of \\\\nbuilding financial innovation ecosystems throughout the United \\\\nStates.\\\\n    Based in Jacksonville, Florida, with a significant \\\\nfootprint here in Little Rock, FIS is one of the world&#x27;s \\\\nlargest and oldest financial technology companies, facilitating \\\\ncommerce across the global financial system. We enable 95 \\\\npercent of the world&#x27;s largest banks, move over $10 trillion of \\\\npayments annually over 1.3 billion payment cards, and process \\\\n1.5 times the U.S. GDP on our asset management technology.\\\\n    By providing a range of services to participants across the \\\\nfinancial services value chain, we have a uniquely \\\\ncomprehensive position in the market and a keen interest in \\\\nfostering a vibrant startup ecosystem. In particular, FIS \\\\nprides itself on its Fintech Accelerator Program, which \\\\nidentifies and advances startup fintech firms with high \\\\npotential.\\\\n    The growth of the fintech sector--like any industry--\\\\ndepends on supporting an ecosystem that connects capital, \\\\ntalent, infrastructure, and a conducive regulatory environment. \\\\nAlong with local partners like The Venture Center and the \\\\nArkansas State and local government, FIS supported the \\\\ndevelopment of a world-class innovation ecosystem here in \\\\nLittle Rock.\\\\n    In 2016, FIS established the Accelerator to bridge the gap \\\\nbetween our traditional financial institution clients and new, \\\\ninnovative fintech startups. We recognized that we could not \\\\npossibly think of every solution to make our clients&#x27; \\\\nexperience better. Therefore, we sought to strategically invest \\\\nin and support high-potential startups that facilitate product \\\\ndiversification and help our clients stay on the cutting edge \\\\nof new technologies. Our community banking clients, in \\\\nparticular, have benefitted from the Accelerator ever since.\\\\n    Each year, we help select 10 innovative technology \\\\ncompanies to advise, connect, and showcase their products and \\\\nservices to the financial industry leaders, potential \\\\ninvestors, and successful engineers, as well as FIS financial \\\\ninstitution clients.\\\\n    Since the Accelerator began, it has graduated 80 alumnus, \\\\n90 percent of whom are still active or have been acquired. This \\\\nincludes companies such as BOND.AI, a company headquartered in \\\\nArkansas, and Trust Stamp, a company that recently completed an \\\\ninitial public offering (IPO). Their success not only benefits \\\\nthe local economy, but it also helps move the entire industry \\\\nforward.\\\\n    Accelerators are critical for growing new fintech \\\\ncompanies. However, successfully developing products and \\\\nservices that meet the evolving needs of consumers also \\\\nrequires active participation from government leaders. By \\\\nengaging with lawmakers and regulators early, new fintech \\\\ncompanies can quickly iterate and develop products to \\\\naccurately reflect regulatory requirements and keep consumers \\\\nsafe.\\\\n    A principal way that regulators can participate in \\\\naccelerating emerging technologies is by creating innovation \\\\nsandboxes. A sandbox allows fintechs to develop and test \\\\nproducts on a limited basis, without fear of regulatory \\\\nreprisal, before going directly to the market, reducing the \\\\nuncertainty of what may or may not be a feasible path forward. \\\\nIt also helps regulators build knowledge of new technologies \\\\nand assess the potential application of existing law and \\\\nregulation.\\\\n    FIS also encourages Federal, State, and local lawmakers to \\\\nconsider additional tools to reduce barriers and incentivize \\\\ninnovation. First, a clear legislative and regulatory framework \\\\nmust be in place to facilitate the ability of financial \\\\ninstitutions to partner with and benefit from innovative \\\\nfintech solutions. Second, talent development grant programs \\\\nmust receive investment and implementation guidance to support \\\\nthe growth of a strong local talent pipeline.\\\\n    And third, incentives such as tax breaks and grant programs \\\\nshould be considered to make cities and regions more attractive \\\\nto investors, large corporations, and entrepreneurs. Venture \\\\ncapital funds are looking for high-quality, innovative \\\\ncompanies with strong potential, irrespective of location. So, \\\\nincentivizing development of local ecosystems like the one in \\\\nLittle Rock is a first step in raising awareness about \\\\ninvestment opportunities.\\\\n    The public-private partnership in Little Rock demonstrates \\\\nhow financial institutions, startups, and regulatory bodies can \\\\ncooperate to build a successful local ecosystem. The results \\\\nhave been more than impressive, leading to numerous benefits to \\\\nFIS, our clients, the startups, and the economies of Little \\\\nRock and wider Arkansas. Over the past 8 years, FIS Accelerator \\\\nalumni have raised more than $1.5 billion in capital.\\\\n    It is our hope that other State and local governments and \\\\nconvener organizations such as incubators can replicate this \\\\npartnership model and generate economic growth and jobs, and \\\\nattract talent transplants from around the world.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity. I look forward to your \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Wheelis can be found on page \\\\n47 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for \\\\nyour oral presentation.\\\\n\\\\n     STATEMENT OF RAVI LOGANATHAN, HEAD, FINANCIAL INSTI-\\\\n       TUTION SERVICE,  SARDINE; AND PRESIDENT,  SARDINEX \\\\n       CONSORTIUM\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. Thank you, Chairman Hill, and members of \\\\nthe subcommittee. I am Ravi Loganathan. I head up our financial \\\\ninstitution business line at Sardine. I also head up our \\\\nSardineX Consortium that brings together banks and fintechs to \\\\nfight fraud. It is a privilege to be here today to discuss the \\\\ncrucial interplay between the traditional banking sector and \\\\nthe rapidly-evolving fintech industry, and the critical role of \\\\nfostering innovative ecosystems across America.\\\\n    Sardine, in the fintech landscape, is making contributions \\\\nto behavioral-based fraud detection compliance and risk \\\\nmanagement. Our mission is to revolutionize the way financial \\\\ntransactions are secured online, protecting all participants. \\\\nOur diverse team, comprising industry veterans from \\\\ninstitutions like Revolut, Coinbase, Zelle, PayPal, and Bank of \\\\nAmerica, brings a wealth of experience, enabling us to navigate \\\\nthe complex challenges in today&#x27;s financial services sector.\\\\n    Our comprehensive suite of solutions are designed to \\\\naddress the nuanced demands of modern risk management. This \\\\nincludes our flagship offering in behavior-based fraud \\\\nprevention, which utilizes a blend of device intelligence and \\\\nbehavioral biometrics to outsmart and preempt emerging threats. \\\\nWith over 200 clients across the globe, including fintechs and \\\\ntraditional financial institutions, Sardine monitors \\\\ntransactions with over $150 billion in transaction volume.\\\\n    In today&#x27;s testimony, I aim to shed light on how risk \\\\nmanagement plays a critical role in facilitating collaboration. \\\\nAdditionally, I will highlight how regulators and accelerator \\\\nprograms are instrumental in bridging the gap between banks and \\\\nfintechs, and facilitating collaboration.\\\\n    I will start on the risk management side by highlighting \\\\ntwo solutions Sardine currently has in the marketplace: \\\\nSardineX, which is the consortium that is helping bring \\\\ntogether banks and fintechs; and our SponsorOS solution that is \\\\nenabling community banks and credit unions to scale their \\\\nBanking-as-a-Service (BaaS) offering.\\\\n    SardineX is pivotal in managing real-time counterparty \\\\nrisks, especially as the U.S. now moves to real-time payment \\\\nand instant settlement with systems like FedNow, and Clearing \\\\nHouse RTP. The utility allows parties and financial services to \\\\ninquire about the entities conducting the transaction. Upon \\\\ninquiry, Sardine provides signals under the framework of the \\\\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act for fraud information sharing, and \\\\nSection 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act for detecting money \\\\nlaundering activities. These insights are crucial for \\\\ninstitutions to make informed decisions in real time, enhancing \\\\ntransaction security.\\\\n    Furthermore, Sardine is a member-run organization \\\\nrepresenting a diverse group of financial institutions and \\\\nfintechs. Its operating rules and governance structure are \\\\nratified by its members, ensuring a collaborative approach to \\\\nmanaging this critical utility.\\\\n    Now, I will turn to SponsorOS, which is tailored for \\\\nBanking-as-a-Service. It is vital for helping regional and \\\\ncommunity banks scale programs, while effectively managing \\\\nregulatory and reputational risks. It provides a uniform \\\\nplatform for fraud protection, compliance service, and risk \\\\nmanagement, indispensable for banks in automating control \\\\nmechanisms for their fintech partners.\\\\n    SponsorOS also enables banks to proactively monitor fintech \\\\npartner performance and mitigate compliance and regulatory \\\\nrisk, simultaneously empowers fintechs to comply with banks&#x27; \\\\nprogram standards by implementing robust fraud detection and \\\\ncompliance systems. This two-fold approach not only streamlines \\\\noperations but also ensures that both banks and fintechs adhere \\\\nto higher standards of security and regulatory compliance, \\\\nfostering a mutually-beneficial risk-aware partnership.\\\\n    The emerging threat of AI-enabled fraud, including \\\\ngenerated phishing, deepfake identity theft, and automated \\\\nsocial engineering, underscores the importance of our work. A \\\\nunited front with banks and fintech companies collaborating and \\\\nsharing data is essential to counter these sophisticated \\\\nthreats that are emerging in the financial space.\\\\n    Regulators play an important role in setting the framework \\\\nfor collaboration and innovation, shaping how financial \\\\ninstitutions and fintechs can work together effectively, while \\\\nensuring consumer protection and market stability. Enhancing \\\\nthe U.S. regulatory framework, perhaps through coordinated \\\\nrelief for the regulatory sandbox participants and universal \\\\nstandards, could foster a more innovation-friendly environment. \\\\nSuch regulatory enhancements would not only stimulate fintech \\\\ninnovation but also ensure a balanced ecosystem where risk \\\\nmanagement and consumer safety are paramount. The approach \\\\ncould draw inspiration from international models, especially in \\\\nthe U.K. and Singapore.\\\\n    Finally, the accelerator programs such as the one offered \\\\nby FIS and The Venture Center are critical in building out the \\\\ninnovation ecosystem. Our experience in participating in this \\\\nprogram last year was invaluable, providing Sardine with \\\\ncritical market insights, access to subject matter experts, and \\\\nstrategic connections with future customers. These programs are \\\\ninstrumental in propelling fintech startups and offering them \\\\nresources to navigate the financial sector&#x27;s complexities.\\\\n    To conclude, the dynamic financial sector necessitates a \\\\nstronger partnership between banks and fintechs, with an \\\\nemphasis on robust risk management. Such collaborations are \\\\nessential for addressing challenges like AI-enabled fraud, and \\\\nfor leveraging technological advancements. By joining forces, \\\\nwe can forge a financial ecosystem that is innovative, \\\\ninclusive, and secure.\\\\n    I look forward to this discussion and to your questions. \\\\nThank you.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Loganathan can be found on \\\\npage 28 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you so much. We are now going to turn \\\\nto Member questions, and as a warning to my colleagues, we will \\\\nhave multiple rounds. We will go until you run dry, Wiley. And \\\\nI will start out and yield myself 5 minutes for questions.\\\\n    I will start with you, Commissioner Marshall. First, thanks \\\\nfor your leadership in the State. We are so grateful for your \\\\ndecades of service to our financial institutions here, and \\\\nthanks for stepping up to be Securities Commissioner, too. That \\\\nis no small task. I am proud of that.\\\\n    We had a hearing earlier this week on this issue of \\\\ninnovation in the regulatory agencies and the sandbox issue, \\\\nbecause I think there has been a really mixed signal sent by \\\\nthe Biden Administration on that, vis-a-vis the Trump \\\\nAdministration when they were first getting started. So, we had \\\\nall the agencies present. We had their heads of innovation \\\\nthere, the first time they had ever been invited to Congress to \\\\ntestify.\\\\n    And I thought it was pretty productive. The give-and-take \\\\nwas good. I think the most important thing was that we \\\\ndiscussed oversight over this innovation sandbox arena at the \\\\nregulatory agencies, and demonstrated what a mixed bag it is--\\\\nnothing really to brag about, I would say, but some baby steps. \\\\nWe asked them, ``Do you coordinate together? Do you have \\\\ninnovation together? Do you have a council that meets, not on a \\\\nglobal basis, but just among yourselves,&#x27;&#x27; for example.\\\\n    But Commissioner, in August, the Federal Reserve \\\\nestablished the Novel Activities Supervision Program, and sent \\\\nout a very short, one-page memo to every financial institution \\\\nand all of the State Commissioners. And in my view, it was \\\\nmeant to be targeting digital assets, crypto, and being \\\\ncautious about that, really asking institutions to come get \\\\npre-approval to do something.\\\\n    As a long-time banker, I am not really used to pre-approval \\\\non routine matters. Do you think this Novel Activities Rule \\\\ncould create confusion, and do you think it has also challenged \\\\nbankers, in that it goes beyond digital assets and crypto into \\\\njust fintech, more generally?\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. Thank you, Congressman. I did follow the \\\\nhearing earlier this week, and was proud to also see my \\\\ncounterparts across the regulatory system speak to what they \\\\nare doing.\\\\n    Specifically to your question, the financial technology \\\\nindustry is moving so quickly, and will continue to move at a \\\\nrapid pace. I believe the guidance and the requirement for \\\\nthings to be called a novel banking activity could perhaps lead \\\\nto some confusion, but I think it is important that the banks \\\\nand the regulatory industry are all at least ensuring that we \\\\nare talking to each other. Because, as I said in my testimony, \\\\nI think when fintech can be successful is when you have those \\\\nearly conversations. And maybe the prior approval part is not \\\\nnecessarily aligned with most community banks and their normal \\\\nactivities. Certainly, I think a traditional fintech activity, \\\\nproduct and service--banks have been doing that for many, many \\\\nyears, and are doing it very well and very successfully.\\\\n    I think that is outside of the novelty idea, and I do not \\\\nthink that needs to be a pre-approval type of activity, because \\\\nthat is normal business operations, and I think we need to \\\\ncontinue to foster that.\\\\n    There are some areas that may be certainly groundbreaking, \\\\nareas which we have not seen as part of our financial services \\\\nindustry. So, I am hopeful that guidance, or the direction from \\\\nthe Federal regulators sheds some light on that, and we can \\\\ncome together to try to make sure we are all on the same page--\\\\nthat is critical, as we have all said today--but not make that \\\\nan area where we just clamp down on the opportunities for banks \\\\nto advance, but ensure that they do so in a safe and sound \\\\nenvironment.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Have you seen a particular example over the \\\\npast 5 years in your leadership where fintech really has \\\\nallowed a community bank to thrive and expand safely and \\\\nsoundly [inaudible] or even improve their compliance \\\\noperations?\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. Yes, sir. Arkansas banks come in a variety of \\\\nsizes. I have banks that are right at $30 billion, and I have \\\\nbanks that are right at $30 million. And I believe that \\\\nfintechs should not be categorized for one asset size or the \\\\nother; they should be able to serve every type of institution, \\\\nwhether it is a rural bank in southeast Arkansas or a bank here \\\\nin central Arkansas that has operations in 12 other States.\\\\n    I believe that all banks can be successful utilizing \\\\nfintech. I believe it is also an opportunity for a small \\\\ncommunity bank, in a cost-effective and managed way, to reach \\\\nnew markets, or perhaps continue to serve markets where they \\\\npreviously felt they were unable to meet their consumers&#x27; \\\\nneeds.\\\\n    I have seen where fintech, and maybe it is a basic form of \\\\nfintech, but when an institution that could not staff a full-\\\\nservice branch in rural Bradley County, maybe they have an \\\\ninteractive teller machine or deploy the next generation of a \\\\nfinancial banking app to reach those customers. I have seen \\\\nthat work firsthand, and I am very proud that our banks are \\\\nadopting advances in technology.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you. Those are good examples. My time \\\\nhas expired. The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Nickel, is \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thank you. Mr. Orduna, given your expertise at \\\\nThe Venture Center, how do you see fintech startups \\\\nspecifically contributing to economic growth, and what areas of \\\\nfinancial innovation hold the most promise for future \\\\ndevelopment?\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. Thank you for the question. I will start with \\\\nthe fintech sector and not looking at the past but looking \\\\nahead.\\\\n    My teammates and I are starting to work with members of the \\\\nArkansas Bankers Association, beginning in the community banks \\\\nand in the rural areas, to try to identify the priorities and \\\\nthe problems of two types of customers: one is obviously the \\\\nborrowers that they are serving; and the other is their \\\\ninternal customers. How can they be more efficient? How can \\\\nthey deal with new technologies? And I have to tell you, for \\\\nexample, when talking to Brad Chambless and his folks down at \\\\nFarmers &amp; Merchants, the word, ``fintech,&#x27;&#x27; is scary.\\\\n    And thinking about technology in general, we need to \\\\nactually translate that into prioritized problems and \\\\nopportunities that begin with the communities. I know those are \\\\nnice words, but that is what we take, working with banks and \\\\nwith financial institutions and providers to actually identify \\\\nwho are the right kind of technology providers, whether it is \\\\nSardine, BOND.AI, Securitech, or BankLabs, to come in and work \\\\ndirectly with those community banks, and for them and their \\\\ncustomers.\\\\n    And so, Mr. Nickel, that actually translates directly not \\\\njust into a good funding round for the startups, which is \\\\ngreat, but it actually translates straight into new products \\\\nand new services that are going to help folks, hopefully like \\\\nBrad and his team, to provide more growth to that community. \\\\nThat is the end game.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. And that is a good transition to my next \\\\nquestion. As we go back to Washington, what are the things we \\\\nshould be doing to help encourage more accelerator and \\\\nincubator programs like yours here, nationwide?\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. That&#x27;s a great question. I have been in the \\\\ncorporate world more than I have been on the side of light and \\\\ngoodness--just kidding--so I saw the wave, more than a decade \\\\nago, of some real excitement about providing entrepreneurship \\\\nsupport into the center of the country. Steve Case did a great \\\\njob of getting things started. I know we have seen a bump in \\\\nsome capital investment in some of these areas, but is not \\\\nenough. And it has not been sustainable.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel, I suggest that we start a dialogue, and I think \\\\nwhat I would strongly suggest to those folks in D.C. is to \\\\nbegin that dialogue with exactly what is happening here. Begin \\\\nit at home. Because there are a lot of initiatives and a lot of \\\\nideas of the folks who are sitting here that need your level of \\\\nsupport.\\\\n    Now, that support could be just recognition that there is \\\\nsome programming already, or funding that is in flight, that is \\\\napplicable, or it could be something novel and new. But I \\\\nbelieve that having these kinds of issues--Representative Hill \\\\nhad a town hall here earlier in the year. We would like to \\\\nreplicate that and actually bring in a bit more of the \\\\nopportunities.\\\\n    I believe it begins with your constituency, quite frankly.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thanks so much. I am going to come back to more \\\\nspecific stuff in the next round of questioning and talk with \\\\nyou about accredited investors.\\\\n    But Commissioner Marshall, I really enjoyed speaking with \\\\nyou earlier and wanted to dig in on another issue here. From a \\\\nregulatory perspective, what are the key challenges and \\\\nopportunities that you are seeing in overseeing fintech \\\\ncompanies?\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. Overseeing institutions that are working \\\\nwith----\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. As we are visiting \\\\nwith our institutions, I do not want to make it sound like the \\\\nlist of obstacles is longer than the list of opportunities, but \\\\nmaybe that is what we hear the most.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. We get those complaints a lot.\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. We certainly hear conversations about, how \\\\nare these products and services going to integrate with our \\\\ncore service providers, which is a critical piece to every \\\\nfinancial institution, and becoming more so every day. Is the \\\\nadoption, is the acceptance going to be supported by staff as \\\\nwell as the customer base, on a larger scale? Do the banks have \\\\nthe necessary staff to really engage in participating with \\\\ncertain fintech firms? What are the compliance risks? What is \\\\nthe cost, the onboarding cost, and the maintenance cost? Do we \\\\nhave a potential risk for cyber or other IT-related issues? And \\\\nthen, of course, do we have the management structure to \\\\ncontinue to maintain it?\\\\n    But the opportunities they see are reaching new sectors, \\\\nnew communities, and new markets. They may have an opportunity \\\\nto experiment with a different product or service on a smaller \\\\nscale that is more cost-efficient, actually, and then make the \\\\ndetermination to exit that strategy, if need be. And, of \\\\ncourse, reaching individuals who may not be able to access \\\\nproducts and services in a timely fashion.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Flood, you \\\\nare recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am going to hold \\\\nmy questions about The Venture Center to my next round, but to \\\\nMr. Wheelis and Mr. Loganathan, I want you each to react to two \\\\ndifferent topics that came up during your testimony. The first \\\\none is, I want to talk about cyber tech, cybersecurity, and I \\\\nwant you to react to the idea of biometrics being fooled by \\\\ndeepfake AI. I can turn my phone on by having it look at my \\\\nface. I also do that to get into my bank account, and into my \\\\nMarriott Bonvoy account. Is innovation happening in that space, \\\\nand if so, what is happening?\\\\n    And the second topic I would like to hear from you both on \\\\nis decentralized finance (DeFi). When I engage on Twitter with \\\\nyounger folks in my district and all over the nation, they \\\\ncontinue try and bring the conversation back to this concept of \\\\nself-custody, DeFi. These are two very different topics, but I \\\\nwould like to give you each 2 minutes to react to the \\\\ncybersecurity, AI deepfakes, and then, what do you think about \\\\nDeFi, where is it going, is it real, and is this something we \\\\nare going to deal with in this decade?\\\\n    We will start with Mr. Wheelis.\\\\n    Mr. Wheelis. Yes. As far as cyber and deepfake, that is \\\\nabsolutely a point that we must all stay on top of as we \\\\ninnovate and move forward. FIS invested a tremendous amount of \\\\nmoney, obviously, to try to protect--as we mentioned earlier, \\\\nwe have seen hacking attempts. We have seen successful hacks in \\\\ncertain areas. We know that is going to be where the industry \\\\ngoes, and we know that we are barely on the front edge of it \\\\nright now. So, I think the investment is paramount.\\\\n    I think that you will see more sophisticated attacks, \\\\nobviously, with generative AI. It is going to make it easier \\\\nfor the bad actors to implement their threats. As far as cyber \\\\nmoving forward, it is just going to be one of our primary \\\\nfocuses. There is no doubt about it.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Okay. Mr. Loganathan?\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. Yes. Thank you, Congressman, for the \\\\nquestion. Let me answer your first part of the question around \\\\nemerging threats, particularly with cyber, AI-driven threats. \\\\nParticularly with the advent of AI, what is going to happen in \\\\nterms of fraud vectors is that it is going to be automated at a \\\\nscale much higher than what you see today. So, if you look at \\\\nall the data breaches we had over many years, that data is now \\\\navailable on the Dark Web. And now, with AI, those AI can be \\\\ntrained on that information to create synthetic identities, and \\\\nhence, you are now able to attack institutions at a much faster \\\\npace. So, that is a significant threat.\\\\n    The AI tools are being enabled not only by individual \\\\nactors but by organized crime, and, as you also know, there are \\\\nstate actors now involved who are beginning to challenge our \\\\ncritical infrastructure, not only in banking but in health care \\\\nand utilities, for example. The last 2 weeks are a pretty good \\\\nexample with which I think you all are very familiar.\\\\n    This is why, as we think about risk management moving \\\\nforward, not only in banking but across other sectors, we have \\\\nto fundamentally reimagine our detection capability. Our \\\\ndetection capability today, the majority of these financial \\\\ninstitutions are backward-looking risk models. That is no \\\\nlonger sufficient. You need real-time risk assessment that \\\\nbrings in your device, your behavioral biometrics, your cross-\\\\nbank transaction data, third-party signals to, in real time, \\\\nrisk-assess that transaction.\\\\n    And what I fear is that many of our institutions are not \\\\nready for what is coming, and what AI is doing is simply \\\\naccelerating that threat, because now the fraud attacks and \\\\nfraud vectors can be done on a much larger scale.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. I appreciate that answer. DeFi?\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. And on the DeFi side, DeFi is here to stay. \\\\nI think as we evolve and work through the kinks, from a risk \\\\nmanagement standpoint--and the regulatory agencies have done a \\\\ngreat job in addressing those risks, and you have seen some of \\\\nthose events in the last year-and-a-half to 2 years--DeFi, \\\\ndigital wallets is here to stay. Digital currencies are here to \\\\nstay, and it is going to be a mechanism by which the next \\\\ngeneration is going to transact. I think we all need to be \\\\nprepared in terms of how we are going to address that from a \\\\nrisk management standpoint, and I think that is the work that \\\\nneeds to be done.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you very much. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back. We will now start \\\\nour second round of questioning, and I yield myself 5 minutes.\\\\n    Let me pick up where we left off there. When you think \\\\nabout the current environment, I have argued consistently since \\\\nI have been on the Financial Services Committee, and certainly \\\\nin my role on our Fintech Task Force several years ago, and now \\\\nas Chair of our Digital Assets Subcommittee, that if we want to \\\\nmove from an analog financial services sector to a fully \\\\ndigital one, we have to abandon username and password, we have \\\\nto have data ownership by individuals, not big companies, and \\\\nwe have to have a really strict view about cyber protection and \\\\nfraud protection. And you are on the front line of basically \\\\nall three of those components.\\\\n    Do you see your products and services easily translating \\\\nover to a blockchain tokenized payment regime where you are \\\\naccomplishing the same mission you are doing now in the real-\\\\ntime payment arena?\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. Very much so. Where we started in terms of \\\\ndeveloping our solutions was helping fintechs shore up their \\\\nprogress and compliance capability. We learned a lot from that, \\\\nand now we are bringing that capability into traditional \\\\nfinance.\\\\n    As you now are looking at DeFi and digital wallets coming \\\\ninto play, you still need a mechanism to move money from your \\\\nfiat side of the house into a digital wallet, hence, you still \\\\nneed that risk management capability to go through the same due \\\\ndiligence you do on the fiat side. And this is where we are \\\\nmaking headway in providing that risk management between \\\\nfinancial institutions and the digital wallets and providing \\\\nthat same risk management capability.\\\\n    So, it is very much translatable and exactly what we are \\\\ndoing right now. Because we are basically taking our risk \\\\nmanagement capability and offering a solution on the payment \\\\nside, effectively an onramp to move funds from fiat to the \\\\ndigital wallets, and we are deploying the same risk management \\\\ncapability. And in that framework, again, the same critical \\\\naspects come into play, the need for multiple signals to assess \\\\nrisk, in real time. You need to bring in your device, your \\\\nbehavioral biometrics, cross-bank transaction information, \\\\ndevice information to, in real time, risk assess, because money \\\\nand those digital assets are moving in real time.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Is it your view that in a stablecoin, \\\\ntokenized payment environment on a blockchain, self-custody \\\\nwallet or not, that the Anti-Money Laundering/Bank Secrecy Act \\\\n(AML/BSA) rules of the U.S. can be adequately enforced?\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. Absolutely, and I think----\\\\n    Chairman Hill. I raise this because this is a very key \\\\nunderstanding that happens at our committee right now. And we \\\\nhave a real gap in the Senate on this right now. The \\\\npresumption is, ipso facto, it is not possible, and therefore, \\\\nthey are zeroing in on something, but I think they are missing \\\\nthe forest because of the trees on this issue. Testimony like \\\\nthis is very helpful, I think, to the three of us.\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. No, absolutely, and I think we have to kind \\\\nof start in stages, and I feel like the first stage here is you \\\\nstill need to move fiat into digital wallets. In that \\\\ntransition phase this is where we can put in robust risk \\\\nmanagement capability to detect two things: the funds moving \\\\nfrom fiat accounts, bank accounts, into a digital wallet, risk \\\\nassess that fiat account; and then, as the funds are moving \\\\ninto a digital wallet, risk assess that digital wallet. We have \\\\nthose capabilities today----\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Yes. But also, you could extend that to say \\\\nthat someone performing a digital asset exchange function could \\\\ndo that as well.\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. Indeed.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. And this issue that, yes, there are broad \\\\naccounts on those exchanges that are effectively, in street \\\\nname, to use a securities analysis view, but they could know \\\\nthat and have that implemented in that crypto exchange \\\\nenvironment as well, looking at wallet verification. They are \\\\nnot telling you whose wallet it is, but they are verifying that \\\\nthey know who it is.\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. Indeed, and I believe the same Know Your \\\\nCustomer (KYC) standards that are being applied in traditional \\\\nfinance today could be applied, and should be applied, and \\\\nshould be enforced on those exchanges. And I think we have made \\\\nsome great headway in the past year, where we are weeding out \\\\nthose who are not complying and reinforcing those exchanges \\\\nthat are complying with the standards.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Right. It is certainly a focus of the \\\\ncommittee. Senator Lummis and I sent a letter to the \\\\nregulators, particularly on Binance, for example, but we will \\\\ntalk more about that.\\\\n    My time has expired. I yield to Mr. Nickel for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Okay. The second round. Thanks again to our \\\\nwitnesses for being here.\\\\n    Just piggybacking on that a little bit, Mr. Loganathan, one \\\\nof the things we have done in this committee, in a bipartisan \\\\nway, is to move forward with a digital asset market structure \\\\nbill, and whether you love crypto or hate crypto, you should be \\\\nin favor of regulation. So, that is something that we are going \\\\nto be tackling as a Congress, hopefully in the coming months.\\\\n    But I wanted to talk about a bill that is one of those \\\\ngood, rare bipartisan bills that we moved in a very positive \\\\nway, the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, our bill that \\\\nI am the Democratic lead on with Mike Flood, my Congressman \\\\ncolleague from the great State of Nebraska.\\\\n    Unfortunately, most startup capital is concentrated in \\\\ncities like San Francisco, New York, and Boston, rather than \\\\ncities like Raleigh, Little Rock, and Lincoln. Our bipartisan \\\\nbill cuts through government red tape to improve choices for \\\\ninvestors, regardless of their net worth. This will result in \\\\ngreater access to capital for minorities, veterans, and women, \\\\nand spur economic growth in places like North Carolina&#x27;s \\\\nResearch Triangle Park, and right here in Little Rock. It is \\\\ncertainly very good for startups.\\\\n    Under the current system, only millionaires can be \\\\naccredited investors, and that does not include your house. So, \\\\nwhen you are talking about whether you have a million bucks to \\\\nbe an accredited investor, you cannot even include your home.\\\\n    We want to open up lucrative private security investments \\\\nto individuals with the financial knowledge to understand the \\\\nrisks they are taking, but again, are not necessarily \\\\nmillionaires. Our bill does just that by expanding the, \\\\n``accredited investor,&#x27;&#x27; definition to allow people to invest \\\\nin private securities and to include individuals who are \\\\ncertified, through a robust exam established by the SEC and \\\\nadministered by FINRA. If you pass a test, you should be able \\\\nto be an accredited investor, and understand the risks.\\\\n    And I understand, while I have not seen anything on this, \\\\nthat there is talk that SEC Chair Gary Gensler wants to move \\\\nthat number up to $5 million, which would price out so many \\\\nmore people.\\\\n    My goal is that I want to move money into startups. I want \\\\nto encourage that innovation. North Carolina&#x27;s Research \\\\nTriangle Park is home to many small biotech companies with \\\\ncritical life-changing technologies. Many of those companies \\\\nrely on accredited investors for capital, so a larger pool of \\\\ninvestors would improve their access to funding, thereby \\\\nspurring growth and bringing good jobs to working families in \\\\nNorth Carolina&#x27;s 13th Congressional District and around the \\\\ncountry, in places like Little Rock.\\\\n    Additionally, according to the Brookings Institution, the \\\\naverage net worth of a typical White family is nearly 10 times \\\\ngreater than that of a Black family. This bill will enable more \\\\ndiverse investors to participate in this asset class by \\\\nallowing individuals to become accredited investors, regardless \\\\nof their net worth. Underrepresented entrepreneurs often \\\\nstruggle to access capital and they would greatly benefit from \\\\na larger pool of more diverse investors, who look like them.\\\\n    Mr. Orduna, the first question is to you. Does The Venture \\\\nCenter work with accredited investors?\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. Yes. We work with accredited investors. We are \\\\npart of the Ark Angel Alliance, which is an angel investment \\\\nnetwork here, and obviously, we are strongly allied and \\\\npartnered with local investors and investment management firms \\\\nsuch as Circumference Group.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Have you encountered any roadblocks with this \\\\ndefinition for folks who want to get in on these investments?\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. You are touching on one of the most important \\\\ntopics that occupies literally my time and our time a lot, \\\\nwhich is getting these promising businesses access to capital \\\\nfor growth. From what you have said, and how you have described \\\\nthis bipartisan bill: first, I am not surprised it is \\\\nbipartisan; and second, I would personally support being able \\\\nto open and broaden the definition of an accredited investor, \\\\nas long as they are aware of the risk of investing into an \\\\nearly-stage venture.\\\\n    But what we have seen here, and what I think is equally \\\\nimportant--I am not sure if the bill addresses this--is we work \\\\nwith a lot of small businesses that are already generating some \\\\ndegree of revenue, and they are also worthy of trying to \\\\nidentify other pools of capital.\\\\n    We are working with the Small Business Administration (SBA) \\\\nhere in Arkansas and we just launched a veteran-owned small \\\\nbusiness accelerator. Nine servicemen and servicewomen have now \\\\nstarted businesses here in Arkansas, and they are generating \\\\nrevenue this year. And as we went through our curation process, \\\\nMr. Nickel, the first and foremost need that they have is still \\\\naccess to capital.\\\\n    I think that, just circling back, absolutely, we would \\\\nsupport the ability to bring in more investors to look at \\\\nearly-stage venture, to look at pre-seed and seed, but we would \\\\nstrongly encourage more initiatives as well to go across the \\\\nportfolio of innovators and entrepreneurs who may already have \\\\nopened a storefront, here or in El Dorado or elsewhere in the \\\\nState.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. My time has expired, but I want to come back to \\\\nMr. Wheelis. I saw you nodding your head, and giving everyone \\\\nelse here a chance to weigh in on the rules for accredited \\\\ninvestors. It is also worth noting that 383 Members of the \\\\nHouse voted to move this bill over to the Senate, so the Senate \\\\nhas the bill, and I am hopeful this is going to be one of the \\\\nrare standalone bills that we can move on to the President&#x27;s \\\\ndesk.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Another bill sent to the Senate to rest.\\\\n    [laughter]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Flood, is \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of tough \\\\nstatistics, by 2030, automation is going to take a lot of jobs \\\\nthat we know of right now in the United States. It is going to \\\\naffect Arkansas. It is going to affect Nebraska. Another one \\\\nfrom the National Venture Capital Association is that \\\\nCalifornia, by itself, receives 59 percent of the total venture \\\\ndeal flow in the United States.\\\\n    I am pleased to hear that over $200 million is flowing here \\\\nin the State of Arkansas, much of it through this enterprise.\\\\n    Mr. Orduna, you made some really good comments in your \\\\nopening statement. I would add that my favorite book is called, \\\\n``The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial \\\\nEcosystem,&#x27;&#x27; and it talks about Boulder, Colorado. You have \\\\ndone that here, and it is ever-evolving.\\\\n    While I represent Lincoln, I live in a town of 25,000 in \\\\nnortheast Nebraska. It would maybe be more similar to Jonesboro \\\\nor El Dorado, Arkansas. We have to have innovation there too. \\\\nHow are we, how are you, how is the State of Arkansas \\\\nconnecting with these communities that could be completely left \\\\nout of the innovation economy, understanding that their success \\\\nis as vital to Arkansas as Little Rock or Fort Smith or what \\\\nyou have going in northwest Arkansas?\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. Yes, I think that is an ongoing challenge. And \\\\nI am relatively new to Arkansas, over the last 2\\\\\\\\1/2\\\\\\\\ years, so \\\\nI bring a little bit of objectivity and a fresh eye. I think it \\\\nbegins with the fact that at the State level, we have some \\\\ncommitted folks and agencies that are really looking to bring \\\\nnot just information but actual resources and innovation \\\\nprograms like ours and others to all corners of the State, and \\\\nto diverse entrepreneurs and innovators in rural areas. And \\\\nworking with the Arkansas Development Commission (AEDC) here, \\\\nfor example, and then reaching out directly to municipalities, \\\\nI think is key.\\\\n    But I think we need to be innovative about how we do this, \\\\nand it has to be a mixture of being on the ground as well as \\\\ntaking advantage of new digital platforms, so that folks in \\\\nJonesboro or folks in Magnolia have as much access to the same \\\\nlevel of resources as someone in Menlo Park or someone in \\\\nBrooklyn. I have worked in both areas before coming here, and \\\\nthere is no reason that we cannot generate, not necessarily the \\\\nsame volume, but we generate the same quality of innovation and \\\\nentrepreneurs and the same quality of businesses here as in \\\\nSilicon Valley or Media Gulch.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Can you also, while we are on this topic, \\\\ndescribe some of the work The Venture Center does with Arkansas \\\\nstudents through the Student Entrepreneur Education Collective?\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. Yes. We are really proud of that work. Some of \\\\nthe things that we have been doing are specific events and \\\\nprograms. We have something called JOLT--I do not believe that \\\\nis an acronym; I think it actually means a burst of \\\\ninspiration--where we work with students basically on \\\\nhackathons and games. And we have been working directly with \\\\nsome of our fellow ESOs. I do not want to just focus on us. \\\\nErrin Stanger, over in North Little Rock, with Innovation Hub, \\\\ndoes a fantastic job working with elementary school as well as \\\\njunior high and high school innovators and entrepreneurs. But \\\\nobviously, Mr. Flood, we have to begin as early as possible.\\\\n    The last thing that I will say is that we held a pitch \\\\ncontest earlier this year at the Discovery Center, where we had \\\\n10 or 11, 10- to 12-year-old students come up and pitch. And I \\\\nwill tell you, they were as polished as you could ever hear. \\\\nSo, I think our future is pretty bright, as long as we can make \\\\nsure that their ideas get air, oxygen, and capital.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. I want to highlight one thing that you said in \\\\nyour early recommendations in your initial testimony. You said, \\\\n``What can government do?&#x27;&#x27; And I was very pleased to hear you \\\\nsay that government should not be the catalyst for these \\\\ninnovations, but it should lead the way in quality of life.\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. And that can happen in any community, of any \\\\nsize. The investment I saw in the arts yesterday--and I am not \\\\nsomebody who would have maybe voted for the arts when I was \\\\nspeaker of our legislature 15 years ago--but I see now the \\\\ndirect connection between investment in public arts and crafts, \\\\nand building an entrepreneurial community, and I see that on \\\\ndisplay here in Little Rock. I think it is outstanding that you \\\\nhighlight that as the appropriate role for the government.\\\\n    With that, I thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. We \\\\nwill start our third round of questions, and we can do more, \\\\nbut I intend this to be the last one unless people want to do \\\\nmore. I am open to that. We have the time to do it.\\\\n    This is a good adult conversation, but this afternoon I get \\\\nto go over to the Innovation Hub, to Errin Stanger&#x27;s \\\\noutstanding operation, something I am always excited about, and \\\\nwe will unveil the winners of the App Challenge. Congress \\\\nsponsors a technology challenge every fall for all 435 \\\\ndistricts around the country, and we ask high school students \\\\nto come up with their best ideas for an app. And tonight, we \\\\nwill unveil the top apps from the 2nd Congressional District \\\\nover at the Innovation Hub.\\\\n    I think, on that comment that Mike made, and Arthur engaged \\\\nin, this is something to put a real premium on, and the \\\\nKauffman Foundation has done that nationwide, and they have \\\\nbeen very active here. And we have seen that effort with things \\\\nlike the Innovation Hub, in partnership with the Rockefeller \\\\nFoundation and others, and the Kauffman Foundation in their \\\\naccelerator programs, and at UCA and Conway and up at Startup \\\\nJunkie in Fayetteville. These are good things. We need more of \\\\nthose. We need those in essentially all of the areas in order \\\\nto fulfill Steve Case&#x27;s goal of the Rise of the Rest.\\\\n    Arthur, you talked about investing in centers like this \\\\naccelerator, and I would like you to sort of compare and \\\\ncontrast for us--obviously, the Federal Government spends quite \\\\na bit of money through the SBA and through the Small Business \\\\nDevelopment Centers, now Small Business Development and \\\\nTechnology Centers, I think is the acronym. Can you tell me how \\\\nyou collaborate with them here? We have one on the University \\\\nof Arkansas at Little Rock campus.\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. Yes. We have been collaborating strongly with \\\\nthem, and I am proud to say this again, that the most recent \\\\ncollaboration, Representative Hill, is a new veteran-owned \\\\nsmall business accelerator program. We have worked with the \\\\nSBDTC, and this was really begun with folks like Jerry Talbert \\\\nat the SBA here, working with Daniel Schutte here at The \\\\nVenture Center, talking to their friends who are servicepeople \\\\nand veterans. And I think that what we have been doing is \\\\nidentifying not just that particular group of folks, but also \\\\nidentifying where else could we work, and who else could we \\\\nwork with , from an acceleration and innovation, \\\\nentrepreneurship perspective.\\\\n    The other areas that we have been talking with them about \\\\ninclude, for example, rural innovation and rural innovators, \\\\nand doing it in partnership--while it begins with that \\\\ndiscussion with the Small Business Administration (SBA) and \\\\nwith the Arkansas Small Business and Technology Center \\\\n(ASBTDC), it also brings in other partners, and that is the \\\\nother thing I stressed, I think, in our written testimony. For \\\\nexample, looking at Socially and Economically Disadvantaged \\\\nIndividuals (SEDI) and rural communities, we have started to \\\\nwork with the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences (UAMS) to \\\\ndo an accelerator for SEDI innovators, and SEDI owners and \\\\ninnovators beginning actually in rural Arkansas. So, that is \\\\nabsolutely critical as well.\\\\n    And then, obviously, we are focused heavily on diversity, \\\\non businesses and business owners of color, and we really \\\\nwelcome, as well, additional corporate as well as government \\\\nparticipation. What you have all said before I completely agree \\\\nwith, that government support at the municipal, State, and \\\\nFederal level is absolutely critical, but the catalyst begins \\\\nhere, at the community level and in the individual sites.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you. I Chair the Congressional \\\\nEntrepreneurship Caucus, and we look for ways to collaborate on \\\\nall of the things that we have talked about today.\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. We have a lot of ideas. We would love to----\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Yes, that is right, and that is why I did \\\\nthe town hall with you last year, mostly on blockchain and the \\\\nregulatory future for digital assets, and the U.S. Venture \\\\nCapital Association, run by an Arkansan, a University of \\\\nArkansas graduate, and the Kauffman Foundation are both very \\\\nactive in that. So, we are distilling those good ideas from the \\\\ngrassroots up to the Congress.\\\\n    I will close in my final comments in this round by thanking \\\\nWylie Nickel for his work on accredited investors, and by \\\\nthanking Mike Flood. All of us have been doing that. Several of \\\\nus in this room, Mr. Hendron, Mr. Montgomery, and I, have spent \\\\na lot of our careers raising money for other people and doing \\\\nReg D private placements, and we have come across this \\\\naccredited investor challenge for decades. And SEC Chair Gary \\\\nGensler, who is a fountain of occasionally below-average ideas, \\\\nif he is promoting what you say to raise it to $5 million, that \\\\nis the below-average idea.\\\\n    The bill I support is to make it talent-based, because what \\\\nI found at UAMS or in the technology space is that you will \\\\nhave a young innovator who knows everything about the \\\\ntechnology, but they do not have the net worth. So, I think \\\\nmaking it professional qualifications or talent-based is a way \\\\nto also do that.\\\\n    Let me yield now to Mr. Flood for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Marshall, you and I \\\\nspoke briefly. You said you had 79 State-chartered banks, I \\\\nbelieve?\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. Seventy-three.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Seventy-three. Okay. One of the bills that is \\\\nunder the subcommittee chairman&#x27;s purview right now, and he has \\\\nbeen a big water carrier on it, is the Digital Assets Market \\\\nStructure bill. And we think about stablecoins, and we think \\\\nabout custody of digital assets by State-chartered banks.\\\\n    One of the big questions right now, one of our struggles \\\\nwith the White House and some on the Democratic side in the \\\\nSenate, especially--it is more bipartisan in the House--is that \\\\nthe White House or the Treasury think there should only be a \\\\nFederal regulator overseeing the regulation of the digital \\\\ncustody of assets, stablecoins. I completely resist that. I \\\\nthink there has to be a State pathway so that we protect our \\\\ndual-tier banking system, which is one of the benefits of \\\\nhaving such a diverse banking system in the United States as \\\\nopposed to maybe Europe or the European Union.\\\\n    Talk to us about how important it is that we preserve the \\\\nState pathway, and is that a hill worth dying on as members of \\\\nour committee? How important is that to you?\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. It is of utmost and absolute importance, and \\\\nthat is not self-serving in my role as a State regulator. That \\\\nis certainly critical to the success of our ongoing industry, \\\\nand quite frankly, the foundation of the duel banking system.\\\\n    As I said in my remarks, our firsthand knowledge of what is \\\\ngoing on in our communities and with our institutions will not \\\\nbe seen or heard if there is not a State pathway in future \\\\nregulation and guidance and legislation in and around financial \\\\nservices. It will not come from D.C.; it will come from the \\\\nboots on the ground that the State systems and the State \\\\nregulators and my counterparts across the country provide.\\\\n    So, it is of utmost importance, and we appreciate and \\\\napplaud any and all efforts to ensure that any future \\\\nlegislation, whether it is around stablecoins or other digital \\\\ninnovations and digital assets, must include that State \\\\npathway.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. And I should add that I do support the Federal \\\\nGovernment having a role, just like the FDIC might have a role, \\\\nor obviously, the Federal Reserve has a role in any State-\\\\nchartered bank. The FDIC is in there inspecting and examining \\\\nyour State-chartered banks.\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. You conduct your own examination. But you need \\\\nto know, and I am sure you already know this because you have \\\\nsuch a good Representative here, that there are a lot of folks \\\\nin Washington who do not think that the State should have this \\\\nability to regulate, especially State-chartered financial \\\\ninstitutions, as it relates to the custody of digital assets. \\\\nAnd I have every reason to believe that as we go into this \\\\nnegotiation, you are going to see a push by the Executive \\\\nBranch to make us relent on this idea of a dual pathway for \\\\nfinancial institutions&#x27; custody of digital assets.\\\\n    As you work with your counterparts in other States, is this \\\\nsomething that State banking directors are talking about? Is \\\\nyour Association of State Banking Directors focused on this? \\\\nAnd if so, what are you hearing from your counterparts in other \\\\nStates?\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. We are absolutely focused on it. It is a core \\\\nof the discussions, as we center around thoughts about proposed \\\\nlegislation, and as we work with our membership. As Congressman \\\\nHill said, many times we have a deep relationship of knowing \\\\neach other and working with each other. My counterparts have \\\\nthe same as with your offices and Mr. Nickel&#x27;s office. And we \\\\nare all full court press, if you will, on ensuring that message \\\\nis heard loud and clear.\\\\n    We are also working with the industry, because the \\\\nindustry, I think, is important. Certainly, I do not want to \\\\nspeak for it as a whole, but I believe the industry would tell \\\\nyou, in large part, that they are always conscious and making \\\\nsure that the State regulators have a part. Because the ability \\\\nto have the charter of choice, whether it is a State charter or \\\\na national bank charter, is significant and important, and the \\\\nindustry will continue to voice that, in my opinion.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. And I will tell you, most of the banks in \\\\nNebraska that were OCC-regulated have given up their national \\\\ncharters and they have opted for the State charter in the last \\\\n10 years. It is amazing, because the OCC has not demonstrated a \\\\nreal willingness to want to regulate a bunch of rural banks and \\\\ncommunity banks in Nebraska.\\\\n    With that, I will say this is a very impressive community. \\\\nYou have a very impressive Member of Congress who represents \\\\nyou. I wish I could recreate this in Lincoln, Nebraska, \\\\ntomorrow, because this is the kind of conversation that shows \\\\nme your community is going in a direction where you are going \\\\nto build wealth and provide opportunities to the people who \\\\ngrew up here, and I hope it all stays in Arkansas so that this \\\\nblossoms into something that looks really, really, really, \\\\nreally healthy in 20 or 30 years.\\\\n    With that, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It was good to see you, \\\\nMr. Nickel. And it was a pleasure being here.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back. Do either of you \\\\nhave another question? We are good on time, right? Do you want \\\\nto do a final round now, a wrap-up round? You just wrapped up. \\\\nThat was very impressive. But we will let you reopen.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Yes, I just have some cleanup.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Why don&#x27;t we say I will yield you 2 minutes, \\\\nand we will see if there is a wrap-up. I yield to my friend \\\\nfrom North Carolina.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thank you. I want to first of all associate \\\\nmyself with your comments about the Senate. One of our \\\\ncolleagues famously observed it takes the Senate 6 months to \\\\nsneeze, so we are trying to do all we can to be patient on \\\\ntheir process on this accredited investor bill.\\\\n    Just as a wrap-up, I saw some agreement. I want to just \\\\nopen it up to the witnesses, if you have anything you want to \\\\nchime in on about the challenges you are facing with the \\\\ncurrent accredited investor rules and definitions.\\\\n    Mr. Wheelis, I&#x27;ll start with you.\\\\n    Mr. Wheelis. Yes. I think you are in a very friendly \\\\naudience for this, because we all understand how important it \\\\nreally is and how to drive that investment level down. Because \\\\nwe know that there are a lot of people who would actively \\\\nsupport innovation in its highest form if they were granted the \\\\nopportunity. So yes, we applaud your bill very much.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Would anyone else like to jump in here as we \\\\nclose out?\\\\n    Mr. Loganathan. Yes. I just wanted to add that any of the \\\\nearly startup concepts are actually funded by individual angel \\\\ninvestors, before any of the venture capital firms come into \\\\nplay. I fully support where you are going with this, because I \\\\nthink we need to expand that entry point for individuals to \\\\ncome in and support those initial founders who do not have the \\\\nbacking of large venture capital firms, particularly in the \\\\nseed phase, which is going to be absolutely important.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. That $50,000 or $100,000 that someone has could \\\\nbe the difference in some amazing new technology, and right \\\\nnow, if you do not have a million bucks, you cannot even get in \\\\nat that level.\\\\n    Just wrapping up, Commissioner Marshall, I enjoyed talking \\\\nwith you again about our excellent Commissioner of Banks, \\\\nKatherine Bosken, in North Carolina. You are both close. From \\\\nyour experience working with fintechs, what is the advice I \\\\nshould bring back to Commissioner Bosken?\\\\n    Ms. Marshall. For my counterparts across the country, if \\\\nthey are not already doing it, I encourage them, through your \\\\nleadership and that of other Members of Congress, to help \\\\ncultivate this type of engagement, and to ensure that they do \\\\nnot feel that it is maybe inappropriate to engage in those \\\\nconversations. I believe that it is wholly appropriate and \\\\nimportant for the future of it that we are in those \\\\nconversations early on. So, the regulatory agencies, working \\\\nwith the industry, working with the entrepreneur companies, \\\\nworking with Members of Congress, if we are all collectively \\\\nengaging in discussion, we are going to come out on a very \\\\nstrong footing going forward, and leave the financial services \\\\nindustry to the next generation, it is critical that we \\\\ncontinue to do so, and I encourage them to seek opportunities \\\\nto engage as well.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thanks so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Flood is \\\\nrecognized for 2 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. I would say that \\\\nwhen I was in Nebraska, before I ended up in Congress, I was at \\\\na nonprofit called Invest Nebraska, which receives up to $16 \\\\nmillion a year in State funds. Do you have a similar public-\\\\nprivate kind of nonprofit corporation that provides access to \\\\nthat risk capital, does some of the vetting, and helps kind of \\\\nhold the hands of those young entrepreneurs--well, they are not \\\\nyoung--of any entrepreneur coming in?\\\\n    Mr. Orduna. Yes, there are several agencies. The one that \\\\nprobably most clearly fits is Innovate Arkansas, which is a \\\\nrecipient and also channels funds from the State as well as \\\\nprivate. And that is something that is absolutely critical.\\\\n    I am very familiar with Innovate Nebraska as well, and some \\\\nof the capital partners they have, like Burlington. They do a \\\\ngreat job focusing not just on agricultural technology and \\\\nagricultural biotechnology, but I think expanding beyond as \\\\nwell. We see the same thing in Iowa. In Iowa, there is an \\\\ninitiative with Debi Durham, the economic development director, \\\\nand BioConnect Iowa, which is a nonprofit, and again, is very \\\\nfocused on one particular sector, which is agricultural \\\\ntechnology.\\\\n    Here in Arkansas, though, I think our focus is broad, which \\\\nI think is important. We have talked about fintech, which is \\\\ngreat. We are the birthplace of fintech because of FIS, I think \\\\nwe proudly claim. But Representative Flood, I think the focus \\\\nhopefully that I want to close on is that we are agnostic and \\\\nsupportive of all of the different technology sectors, \\\\nindustries, and areas where innovation and entrepreneurship is \\\\nbeing explored and being cultivated.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you, Mr. Flood. Let me thank our \\\\nwitnesses for being here today. And I want to thank everybody \\\\nin Little Rock and The Venture Center for hosting today. This \\\\nis exactly what this building is for. And we have had such a \\\\nsuccess over the first decade here at The Venture Center, we \\\\nare really looking forward to the expansion that is going to be \\\\nannounced shortly, that is going to continue to see The Venture \\\\nCenter expands its mission.\\\\n    And this is something I certainly dreamed about when I was \\\\nthe Chair of the Chamber of Commerce here, that we would have a \\\\nmore risky outlook for development here in Little Rock. We are \\\\ngreat at logistics. We are great at wholesale. We are great at \\\\ntransportation. We are great at health care. We are great at \\\\ngovernment. We are great at service businesses here. There is \\\\nno doubtthat we are a capital city, and that is what it feels \\\\nlike. So, we do not boom and we do not bust, and we used to \\\\nbrag about that for 40 years economically here.\\\\n    But my pitch as Chair was that we need to increase our risk \\\\nprofile. We need to have a wider beta on the companies that \\\\noperate here, because that produces wealth and gain and career \\\\nopportunities for people over the long haul, and at a much \\\\nfaster rate. And I think this has been an exciting first decade \\\\nfor The Venture Center.\\\\n    And Mr. Wheelis, we are so grateful to you for your \\\\npartnership at FIS, and we hope that the innovation that you \\\\nhave seen here has helped to expand the portfolio of product \\\\nofferings for your global audience at FIS.\\\\n    With that, if there are no other questions from our \\\\nMembers, this hearing is adjourned.\\\\n    And let me just say, in closing, having adjourned the \\\\nhearing, we are going to have an opportunity to hear from \\\\nBankLabs, BOND.AI, and Securitech, and have a bit of a \\\\ndemonstration day down the hall for our Members so they get to \\\\nhear and ask questions of portfolio companies that have done so \\\\nwell here at The Venture Center.\\\\n    I thank everybody for coming out today.\\\\n    The Chair notes that some Members may have additional \\\\nquestions for this panel, which they may wish to submit in \\\\nwriting. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open \\\\nfor 5 legislative days for Members to submit written questions \\\\nto these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. \\\\nAlso, without objection, Members will have 5 legislative days \\\\nto submit extraneous materials to the Chair for inclusion in \\\\nthe record.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 10:23 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.] \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                            A P P E N D I X\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                            December 8, 2023 \\\\n                            \\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73190/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"04/16/2024\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"ERISA'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY: THE PATH TO HIGHER QUALITY, LOWER COST HEALTHCARE\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73190, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"Education and the Workforce\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                 ERISA&#x27;S 50TH ANNIVERSARY: THE PATH TO\\\\n                 HIGHER QUALITY, LOWER COST HEALTHCARE\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                                HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               Before The\\\\n\\\\n                         SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH,\\\\n                     EMPLOYMENT, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\\\\n\\\\n                                 of the\\\\n\\\\n                    COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE \\\\n                               WORKFORCE\\\\n                     U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             SECOND SESSION\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n             HEARING HELD IN WASHINGTON, DC, APRIL 16, 2024\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                           Serial No. 118-45\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n  Printed for the use of the Committee on Education and the Workforce \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n              [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        Available via: edworkforce.house.gov or www.govinfo.gov \\\\n                               ______\\\\n\\\\n                 U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE\\\\n\\\\n56-782 PDF               WASHINGTON : 2024 \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        \\\\n                COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE\\\\n\\\\n               VIRGINIA FOXX, North Carolina, Chairwoman\\\\n\\\\nJOE WILSON, South Carolina           ROBERT C. ``BOBBY&#x27;&#x27; SCOTT, Virginia, \\\\nGLENN THOMPSON, Pennsylvania           Ranking Member\\\\nTIM WALBERG, Michigan                RAUL M.

The hearing on the Subcommittee on Health, \\\\nEmployment Labor and Pensions will come to order. I note that a \\\\nquorum is present. Without objection, the Chair is authorized \\\\nto call a recess at any time. Fifty years ago President Ford \\\\nsigned into law the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, \\\\nor better known as ERISA.\\\\n    For half a century ERISA has stood as the cornerstone of \\\\nour Nation&#x27;s commitment to safeguarding the benefits of hard-\\\\nworking Americans. Congress has a responsibility to not merely \\\\ncreate laws, but to conduct genuine oversight, and better \\\\nunderstand how the laws we pass impact the lives of our \\\\nconstituents.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s hearing is a response to feedback from nearly 100 \\\\nstakeholders on ERISA&#x27;s implementation. As we prepare to \\\\ndiscuss ways to improve the law, we should first recognize the \\\\nvital rule ERISA plays in ensuring access to employer sponsored \\\\nbenefits, especially as it relates to health care.\\\\n    ERISA&#x27;s strength lies in its preemption provisions, which \\\\nprovide employers to offer consistent and comprehensive \\\\nbenefits across State lines. Without ERISA, multi-State \\\\nemployers would be left to navigate a patchwork of State \\\\nmandates and onerous regulations.\\\\n    Efforts to undermine ERISA preemption threaten the \\\\nstability of employer-sponsored health insurance. Without it, \\\\ncosts could rise for employers and employees alike. \\\\nUnfortunately, a single payer health care system is the actual \\\\ngoal of many democrats on the other side of the aisle.\\\\n    Because ERISA reduces regulatory burdens, it allows \\\\nemployers to innovate to meet the needs of their employees and \\\\nadapt the evolving health care landscape. For example, when \\\\ntelehealth exploded overnight because of COVID, employers were \\\\nable to respond quickly by creating new telehealth coverage \\\\noptions.\\\\n    Business owners drive American ingenuity, and almost \\\\nanything the government does, the private sector can do better, \\\\nand this especially applies to health care. ERISA allows \\\\nemployers to purchase new avenues for improving health care \\\\ndelivery and outcomes. ERISA fosters an environment where free \\\\nmarkets can work and expand access to new cutting edge \\\\ntreatments and benefits.\\\\n    However, the health care system of 2024 is vastly different \\\\nthan that of 1974, and it is clear from responsive stakeholders \\\\nthat there are ways to strengthen and improve current law. \\\\nClarifying fiduciary responsibilities for employers, promoting \\\\ncompetition by preventing self-dealing, and facilitating \\\\ngreater data sharing are just a few of the steps we can take to \\\\nempower job creators with the tools they need to lower health \\\\ncare costs and improve the quality of coverage for their \\\\nemployees.\\\\n    For too long, Congress has allowed the Medicare for all \\\\nmentality to dominate our health care conversations, ignoring \\\\nthe fact that majority of Americans do not have, and do not \\\\nwant, government health care. In fact, 153 million Americans \\\\nhave employer sponsored health benefits. The private health \\\\ncare system is not perfect, but a 2021 survey by Employee \\\\nBenefits Research Institute and Greenwald Research showed that \\\\n63 percent of employees are satisfied with their coverage.\\\\n    I believe that more employer driven flexibility, innovation \\\\nand competition will do far more to decrease health care costs \\\\nthan government-controlled price setting ever will. That is \\\\nbecause competition, the free market, drives down costs while \\\\ngovernment subsidized health care places a greater burden on \\\\nAmerican taxpayers.\\\\n    I look forward to today&#x27;s discussion, and I yield to the \\\\nRanking Member for his opening statement.\\\\n    [The Statement of Chairman Good follows:] \\\\n    \\\\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]    \\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for \\\\nholding today&#x27;s hearing on how we can improve upon the \\\\nprotection afforded to American workers and their families \\\\nthrough the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. \\\\nI want to thank all the witnesses for being here as well.\\\\n    When ERISA was enacted in 1974, Congress stated clearly \\\\nthat the fundamental purpose of the law was to ``Protect the \\\\ninterests of participants in employee benefit plans and their \\\\nbeneficiaries.&#x27;&#x27; Accordingly, the law establishes consumer \\\\nprotection standards and provides remedies and access to the \\\\ncourts for workers whose plans are mismanaged.\\\\n    Critically, it ensures that those who serve as fiduciaries \\\\nmust administer plans for the exclusive purpose of providing \\\\nbenefits and may pay only reasonable expenses when they do so. \\\\nWhile I expect that we will hear a lot today about the issues \\\\nemployers face, it is important that we not forget the \\\\nfundamental purpose of the law.\\\\n    Any conversation about ERISA that does not put workers and \\\\ntheir families at its very center misses the mark. Today&#x27;s \\\\nhearing is crucial. ERISA&#x27;s impact on health care in the United \\\\nStates is substantial. The vast majority of people under the \\\\nage of 65 rely on job-based plans for access to essential \\\\nmedical services.\\\\n    With over 164 million workers and their families benefiting \\\\nfrom these arrangements, the significance of ERISA in \\\\nregulating many of these plans cannot be overstated. However, \\\\nour workforce and health care landscape has transformed \\\\nconsiderably since ERISA was first passed in 1974.\\\\n    The law originally included huge, substantive standards \\\\nrelating to health benefits when it was enacted. Over the past \\\\n50 years policymakers have found that, as a result, ERISA has \\\\nfailed to live up to its promise. There are still significant \\\\ngaps in health care coverage for millions of Americans.\\\\n    Secrecy and excessive fees paid to third party \\\\nadministrators, and pharmacy benefit managers, and exorbitant \\\\nprices charged for medical care and prescription medication all \\\\nof which who squeeze workers through higher premiums and out-\\\\nof-pocket costs. While many challenges remain, it is important \\\\nto note the progress we have made, in improving the \\\\naffordability of health care for workers and their families in \\\\nrecent years.\\\\n    For example, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, workers \\\\nenjoy preventive health care services free of charge. \\\\nDependents can stay on their parents&#x27; health policy until age \\\\n26. Additionally, in 2021, congressional Democrats passed the \\\\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act, which enhanced the ACA tax credits to \\\\nlower monthly costs for low-income individuals and eliminated \\\\nthe subsidy cliff so that more low-and moderate-income \\\\nindividuals could get coverage.\\\\n    These reforms strengthened access to benefits for millions \\\\nof Americans, but there is still room for further improvement. \\\\nI hope we can work together in a bipartisan way on these \\\\nissues. For example, there is much work to be done to ensure \\\\nthat job-based benefits, including long-term disability \\\\ninsurance are available to people who need behavioral health \\\\ncare.\\\\n    Access to disability insurance is critical to ensuring \\\\nworkers have the financial security they need once they \\\\nexperience a physical disability or illness that makes it \\\\nimpossible for them to work. Unfortunately, a recent report by \\\\nthe ERISA Advisory Council found that long-term disability \\\\nbenefit plans often place discriminatory limitations on \\\\ncoverage based on mental health and substance abuse disorders.\\\\n    The report contains several thoughtful recommendations on \\\\nhow to address these issues, including by applying parity for \\\\nbehavioral health to long-term disability benefits. I hope we \\\\ncan discuss this issue and others that will help ensure that \\\\nERISA lives up to its promise for workers and families. I look \\\\nforward to a productive discussion, and yield back, Mr. \\\\nChairman.\\\\n    [The Statement of Ranking Member DeSaulnier follows:] \\\\n    \\\\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] \\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman Good.

RUSSELL DUBOSE, VICE PRESIDENT OF \\\\n     HUMAN RESOURCES, PHIFER, INC., TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA \\\\n\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and \\\\nmembers of the Subcommittee. My name is Russell DuBose, and I \\\\nhave the privilege of serving as the Vice President of Human \\\\nResources for Phifer, Incorporated, a mid-sized manufacturing \\\\ncorporation headquartered in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\\\\n    I am also the Chair of the Alabama Health Consortium, a \\\\ncoalition of employers in my home State. Today I am testifying \\\\non behalf of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser \\\\nCoalitions, its more than 40 regional employer purchaser \\\\ncoalition members, who representative public and private \\\\nsector, nonprofit, union organizations and more than 45 million \\\\nAmericans that spend more than 400 billion annually on health \\\\ncare.\\\\n    I am here to advocate for the critical role that ERISA \\\\nplays in enabling employers like us to provide high-quality, \\\\nuniform health coverages to our employees across State lines. \\\\nTo do that, I would like to tell you the story about how Phifer \\\\nhas leveraged the flexibility of ERISA to relentlessly push for \\\\nhealth care value for our roughly 2,700 employees and \\\\ndependents spread across Alabama, California and Pennsylvania.\\\\n    Throughout the 1990&#x27;s and 2000&#x27;s maintaining competitive \\\\nwages and benefits remained relatively stable, however, post-\\\\n2010 we saw a notable increase in benefit costs, particularly \\\\nhealth care. By 2015, it became evident that our current path \\\\nwas unsustainable, threatening both the affordability of our \\\\nplan, and the well-being of our members.\\\\n    Recognizing the urgent need for change we enacted a \\\\ntransformative approach guided by our corporate motto, which is \\\\nthe golden rule. Inspired by the work of Dave Chase, the \\\\nfounder of Health Rosetta, an organization dedicated to \\\\ntransforming health care, and using the principles of Lean Six \\\\nSigma, we undertook dedicated efforts to reimagine how to \\\\ndeliver value for our families.\\\\n    Our flagship initiative is the PhiferCares Clinic, an \\\\nonsite advanced primary care health center designed to provide \\\\ncomprehensive and zero cost share health care services by \\\\nintegrating elements such as enhanced access, and contracting \\\\nwith high-quality providers, the clinic became a trusted health \\\\ncare partner for our plan members.\\\\n    Not only have we achieved significant cost savings, but we \\\\nhave also seen improvements in health outcomes, which reduce \\\\nhospital admissions, and better chronic disease management. \\\\nOver the years, Phifer is continuing to expand our initiatives \\\\nto include optimizing our pharmacy benefits by selecting a \\\\ntransparent mid-size PBM, direct contracting with high-quality \\\\nproviders, onsite nurses, patient care navigators, and the \\\\ndevelopment of specialty programs like weight loss management.\\\\n    In 2023, amidst health care inflation, we pivoted our \\\\napproach to focus on health care advocacy and wellness \\\\nenhancement. This shift led to the launch of our zero-cost \\\\nshare by Phifer&#x27;s pharmacy, further enhancing accessibility and \\\\nadherence to medication.\\\\n    Our commitment to innovation has allowed us to maintain a \\\\nrelatively flat net health care spend for the last 4 years. \\\\nYear over year, we invested the savings from our health care \\\\nback into our workforce and community through an annual health \\\\ncare dividend. These dividends have created a virtual cycle of \\\\npositive impact by repurposing previously squandered dollars to \\\\nsupport meaningful initiatives.\\\\n    To date, more than 100 dependents have received \\\\ntransformative college scholarships to local Universities, \\\\nincluding University of Alabama, Roll Tide. Hundreds more have \\\\nbenefited from our summer enrichment program. In 2022, our \\\\ndividend was used to end copays for our onsite pharmacy, \\\\nsparing 1,700 families from cost-sharing for prescription \\\\ndrugs.\\\\n    Our success at Phifer is not an isolated case. Employees \\\\nacross the country are reshaping the health care landscape, \\\\ndriving toward better value and outcome for their employees. \\\\nHowever, the foundation of our efforts, ERISA, is under threat. \\\\nIf ERISA preemption were weakened, employers would face a \\\\npatchwork of State regulations, jeopardizing our ability to \\\\noffer uniform, affordable coverage across State lines.\\\\n    This would undermine the progress we have made and force \\\\nmany employers to revert to fully insured plans, limiting \\\\ninnovation and driving up costs. Much of that threat comes from \\\\nState legislation designed to regulate PBM&#x27;s, which is itself \\\\ndriven by the lack of meaningful Federal regulation to reign in \\\\nanti-competitive practices.\\\\n    We strongly urge Congress to pass the Lower Cost More \\\\nTransparent Act this year and go further by enacting \\\\nlegislation coming out of the Senate that would ban spread \\\\npricing, and mandate full rebate pass routes to plan sponsors. \\\\nMy written testimony includes additional recommendations to \\\\nhelp self-insured plan sponsors meet their fiduciary \\\\nobligations under ERISA.\\\\n    ERISA has served as a cornerstone of employer sponsored \\\\nhealth coverage for five decades, enabling employers like \\\\nPhifer to provide quality cares to our employees and their \\\\nfamilies. Thank you for this opportunity to share our \\\\nperspective, and I welcome your questions.\\\\n    [The Statement of Mr. DuBose follows:]\\\\n    \\\\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] \\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. DuBose. Now Ms. Mancino is \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n    THE STATEMENT OF MS. MAIRIN MANCINO, SENIOR ADVISOR, \\\\n      POLICY,  PETERSON CENTER ON HEALTHCARE,  NEW YORK, \\\\n      NEW YORK\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Mancino. Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and \\\\ndistinguished members of the Committee. My name is Mairin \\\\nMancino. I am the Senior Advisor for Policy at the Peterson \\\\nCenter on Healthcare, a division of the nonpartisan Peter G. \\\\nPeterson Foundation.\\\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, as you \\\\nexamine ways to buildupon and strengthen ERISA and employer \\\\nsponsored health care. Founded in 2014, the Center is a \\\\nnonprofit organization dedicated to making higher quality, more \\\\naffordable health care a reality for all Americans.\\\\n    We seek to transform health care in the United States into \\\\na more efficient and cost-effective system by finding \\\\ninnovative solutions that improve quality and lower costs and \\\\naccelerate their adoption at scale.\\\\n    My written testimony today contains a number of detailed \\\\nrecommendations we have identified through our work, including \\\\nthrough a recent convening of employers and purchasing groups \\\\nregarding data access and market challenges. Today I will \\\\nhighlight a few of the key recommendations from my written \\\\ntestimony.\\\\n    First, Congress should strengthen an employer&#x27;s ability to \\\\naccess their own data. As this Committee knows well, Congress \\\\nhas prohibited gag clauses in ERISA, yet third party \\\\nadministrators continue to hinder access to claims data. \\\\nCongress should act to fix this problem or direct the \\\\nDepartment of Labor to issue guidance that expressly prohibits \\\\nTPAs from restricting employer plan access to their members \\\\nclaims data.\\\\n    Second, Congress should increase the utility of data \\\\navailable to employers. Even in its limited form to date, we \\\\nhave seen price transparency efforts motivate employers to use \\\\ndata in ways to promote competition, yet more work is needed. \\\\nCongressional actions to codify payer and provider transparency \\\\nrules into law will send a clear message.\\\\n    Price transparency is vital to competitive purchasing. \\\\nEmployers also need utilization information to increase their \\\\nunderstanding of cost and quality drivers within their own \\\\nplans, and how that compares to others when they design their \\\\nhealth care benefits.\\\\n    To achieve this, Congress could create incentives to \\\\nencourage employers and health plans to contribute to multi-\\\\npayer claims data bases. The information available through \\\\nthese data bases can support employer negotiations, and \\\\ndecisionmaking about health benefit design.\\\\n    Third, data needs to be made available to patients, so they \\\\ncan make informed decisions about their care. The bipartisan No \\\\nSurprises Act contained a provision called the advanced \\\\nexplanation of benefits, which makes personalized cost \\\\nestimates available to patients before they receive scheduled \\\\ncare. This provision was scheduled to go into effect at the \\\\nstart of 2022.\\\\n    However, the administration has delayed implementation. \\\\nCongress should work to ensure the administration remains \\\\nfocused on implementing these requirements, so that consumers \\\\nhave access to this actionable information.\\\\n    Fourth, lawmakers should promote greater competition within \\\\nthe employer health care market by addressing anti-competitive \\\\npractices. We understand through our work that dominant \\\\nhospitals and payers are exerting their market power via \\\\ncontracting terms that inhibit competition.\\\\n    For example, all or nothing clauses require insurers to \\\\ninclude all of a health system&#x27;s network--excuse me, a health \\\\nsystem&#x27;s providers and facilities in their network, regardless \\\\nof cost or quality differences. Most favored nation clauses \\\\nalso limit competition by guaranteeing that an insurer received \\\\nterms from a provider that are at least as favorable as those \\\\nprovided to any other insurer, which prevents them from \\\\ncontracting with others at lower rates.\\\\n    These clauses give dominant organizations an unfair \\\\nadvantage over competitors and prevents new benefit designs and \\\\ninnovative contracting. Finally, Congress should expand the \\\\nrole of the ERISA Advisory Council or create a new advisory \\\\ncouncil to provide annual recommendations to Congress. Congress \\\\nshould ensure that this council is representative, balanced, \\\\nadequately funded and empowered to contribute ideas and topics \\\\nfor review.\\\\n    Specific topics for the council could include employer \\\\nmarket costs, prices and utilization trends. Transparency, \\\\nincluding price transparency, billing or location transparency, \\\\nhealth care ownership transparency, data sharing compliance, \\\\nissues around network adequacy, as well as benefit design \\\\ntrends.\\\\n    In closing, policy reforms that seek to improve employers \\\\npurchasing leverage and access to better data will bolster \\\\ncompetition, equipping employers with the tools necessary to \\\\nnegotiate confidently in the health care market, and meet \\\\nfiduciary responsibilities.\\\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look \\\\nforward to your questions.\\\\n    [The Statement of Ms. Mancino follows:] \\\\n    \\\\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you very much. Ms. Handorf, you are \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n       STATEMENT OF MS. KAREN L. HANDORF, SENIOR COUNSEL, \\\\n               BERGER MONTAGUE, WASHINGTON, D.C.\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Chairperson Good, Ranking Members of the \\\\nCommittee, and Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and the other members \\\\nof the Committee. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to \\\\ntestify. I have represented participants and beneficiaries and \\\\nemployee benefit plans for the last 40 years, both in the \\\\ngovernment and in private sector.\\\\n    Congress passed ERISA to protect the interests of \\\\nparticipants and beneficiaries by imposing standards of conduct \\\\non plan fiduciaries, and for providing for appropriate \\\\nremedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts. \\\\nPlans were to be administered for the exclusive purpose of \\\\nproviding benefits and defraying reasonable costs and expenses \\\\nof administering the plan.\\\\n    Those purposes are not being served. Those hired to \\\\nadminister plans operate under a veil of secrecy and charge \\\\nundisclosed fees that have inflated the cost of care, defeating \\\\ncongressional intent that plan money be used primarily to pay \\\\nfor benefits.\\\\n    Plan participants seeking access to the courts to protect \\\\ntheir benefits are increasingly faced with barriers and limited \\\\nremedies. 65 percent of American workers are now in self-funded \\\\nhealth plans that contract with large insurance companies for \\\\naccess to their provider networks, and for claims \\\\nadministration. These large insurers are not directly regulated \\\\nby ERISA and operate under a veil of secrecy.\\\\n    They will not give plan fiduciaries access to their claims \\\\ndata, necessary to determine how claims are priced, and whether \\\\ntheir compensation is reasonable. They assert that they are not \\\\nsubject to the requirements in 408(b)(2) to disclose their \\\\nfees, thus leaving plans making it virtually impossible for \\\\nplans to monitor the fees of their largest service providers.\\\\n    The CAA&#x27;s enforcement mechanisms, terminating contracts, is \\\\nnot practical where there are no alternative service providers \\\\nin the geographic region, or the alternative providers engage \\\\nin the same practices. When plans can obtain data, they find \\\\nmultiple mistakes that are revealed.\\\\n    They find that the prices paid by the plans does not line \\\\nup with the provider&#x27;s posted negotiated rates, and they find \\\\nthat there are fees that have not been disclosed to them. A \\\\nrecent New York Times article reported how TPAs reprice out-of-\\\\nnetwork claims and charge a percentage of the difference \\\\nbetween the build and repriced amount of it as a fee.\\\\n    The participants are harmed because they are providers who \\\\nhave not agreed to the priced amount, directly bill the patient \\\\nfor the remaining amount, in one case $100,000.00. The plan is \\\\nharmed because it pays a significant and undisclosed \\\\npercentage-based fee for the savings. In one case $50,000.00 \\\\nfor processing a single hospital bill.\\\\n    All of this increases the cost to workers who contribute to \\\\nthe cost through wage concessions, premium payments, copayments \\\\nand deductibles. These costs make it difficult for workers and \\\\ntheir families to get the care they need. A 2019 survey found \\\\nthat 33 percent of people with employer-sponsored insurance put \\\\noff or postponed needed care due to cost.\\\\n    18 percent did not fill prescriptions, rationed doses, or \\\\nskipped doses of medicine. Significant numbers of workers carry \\\\nsubstantial medical debt. It will not help if cost savings are \\\\nachieved, but there are no consequences if plan fiduciaries do \\\\nnot follow the rules designed to protect workers and their \\\\nfamilies.\\\\n    In a recent case, doctors for a 27-year-old patient were \\\\nunable to obtain prior authorization for an immediate heart \\\\ntransplant that would have saved the patient&#x27;s life. They \\\\nsought a 72-hour expedited external review, which they were \\\\nentitled to under the law, but it was treated as a 45-day \\\\nstandard review.\\\\n    The patient died 5 days after the decision that eventually \\\\nreversed the client&#x27;s denial should have been rendered. The \\\\npatient&#x27;s estate sued for disgorgement of the amount the \\\\ndefendant saved by mismanaging the claim, but the court said \\\\nthey were not entitled to that remedy.\\\\n    Workers attempting to protect their rights are faced with \\\\nconstant barriers. Their lawyers cannot get attorney&#x27;s fees for \\\\nhandling their internal appeals. Workers are denied claims \\\\nfiles, plan venue provisions prevent them from suing where it \\\\nis convenient. Arbitration agreements, and class action waivers \\\\nsignificantly hurt their opportunity to protect their benefits. \\\\nCongress should consider this.\\\\n    [The Statement of Ms. Kandorf follows:] \\\\n    \\\\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]   \\\\n   \\\\n    Chairman Good.

More importantly, thank you for taking the time \\\\nto celebrate my friend, ERISA, leading to its 50th anniversary.\\\\n    My perspective comes from 16 years as an attorney \\\\nspecializing in ERISA law. I began my career at a national law \\\\nfirm and have spent the last 10 years at Lockton, the world&#x27;s \\\\nlargest privately held independent insurance brokerage firm. \\\\nLockton works with nearly 5,000 employer and union health plan \\\\nsponsors across all industries, geographies and sizes.\\\\n    Our role as a broker gives us a unique vantage point to \\\\nobjectively observe the health care landscape. We help our \\\\nclients design and operate their health plans in a way that is \\\\nconsistent with their workforce well-being goals, and of \\\\ncourse, compliance with ERISA.\\\\n    This includes evaluating and providing accountability for \\\\ninsurers, TTAs, PBMs, and others. Enough about me, and enough \\\\nabout Lockton. The real hero today is employer sponsored health \\\\ncare, and the plan sponsors who work diligently to ensure high-\\\\nquality and affordable benefits for their workers and families.\\\\n    Like Hans Solo has Chewy, and Barbie has Ken, our hero is \\\\nsupported by an indispensable sidekick, ERISA. Employer \\\\nsponsored insurance is the bedrock of the American health \\\\ninsurance system, providing health coverage to over half of all \\\\nAmericans.\\\\n    As described in my written testimony, polling data shows \\\\nESI is well liked, and it provides significant benefits to \\\\nworkers and their families, employers and unions, and the \\\\nFederal Government.\\\\n    ESI would not be nearly as popular and effective without \\\\nERISA. Still, health plan sponsors face a three headed monster, \\\\never rising health care costs, burdensome administrative \\\\nrequirements, and increasingly complex compliance obligations \\\\nand litigation risks.\\\\n    Today, you have the opportunity to support the dynamic duo \\\\nof ESI and ERISA, but it is crucial that you keep two guiding \\\\nprinciples before you at all times. First, do not harm. Second, \\\\nmake it easier to provide high-quality and affordable benefits. \\\\nFirst, do no harm.\\\\n    According to ERISA&#x27;s drafters, the crowning achievement of \\\\nERISA is its preemption provision. ERISA preemption allows plan \\\\nsponsors to offer uniform and equitable benefits, innovate and \\\\nrespond to the unique health care needs of their workers and \\\\nfamilies. Sadly, we have seen states pass laws subverting ERISA \\\\npreemption, and even the Departments of Labor and Justice have \\\\npushed a harmful theory undermining ERISA.\\\\n    The Committee should stand firm against any attempts to \\\\nweaken ERISA preemption, including calling into account wayward \\\\nadministrative agencies. Second, making it easier to provide \\\\nhigh-quality and affordable benefits. This will benefit both \\\\nworkers and employers.\\\\n    We praise the Committee for its work to increase quality \\\\nand reduce costs, most recently with passage of the lower cost \\\\nMore Transparency Act. We support that legislation, but we \\\\nthink additional modifications will prove even more beneficial. \\\\nFirst, strengthen the prohibition on gag clauses to affirmative \\\\nrequire data sharing with both the plan sponsor and business \\\\nassociates supporting the plan sponsor.\\\\n    Allow data to be used in any manner and for any purpose \\\\npermitting by HIPAA. Second, ensure timely and ongoing \\\\ndisclosures of transparency data in a consistent format. Third, \\\\nrequire TPAs, PBMs, pharmacy purchasing coalitions and other \\\\nservice providers to disclose their direct and indirect \\\\ncompensation.\\\\n    Fourth, hold TPAs, PBMs and others accountable for \\\\ncompliance and reporting obligations related to their services. \\\\nFifth, allow for disclosures electronically, and take other \\\\nsteps to streamline reporting and disclosure obligations. \\\\nSixth, work with the Department of Labor to help plan sponsors \\\\nbetter understand and comply with their fiduciary obligations, \\\\nespecially their duty to monitor.\\\\n    Seventh, prohibit anti-competitive contract terms and \\\\ndownstream agreements with hospitals and providers. Eighth, \\\\nconsider ways to reduce pharmacy costs. Again, I thank you for \\\\nthe time, and I thank you for the opportunity to work with you \\\\nas we join forces to support ERISA and ESI.\\\\n    [The Statement of Mr. Behrens follows:] \\\\n    \\\\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] \\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Behrens. Under Committee Rule \\\\n9, we will now question witnesses under the 5-minute rule. I \\\\nwill wait to ask my questions, and therefore I recognize Mr. \\\\nWalberg from Michigan for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the panel \\\\nfor being here, and happy anniversary, Mr. Behrens. I am about \\\\nready to celebrate my 50th wedding anniversary and it has been \\\\nwonderful, as long as we did the things that were necessary, \\\\neven reforms of me, during those 50 years to make it continue \\\\nworking.\\\\n    ERISA, as you have said, is a very popular tool for \\\\nemployer sponsored insurance, and I guess the question I would \\\\nask subsequent to what you, I think, very clearly stated, how \\\\nwe as Congress protect it, and continue the opportunity;\\\\n    What parts of the law do you believe are most crucial to \\\\nmaintaining the success and popularity?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. I think the most important one starts with \\\\nERISA preemption. The preemption provision, as we see in the \\\\nlegislative history, is considered its crowning achievement. \\\\nOne of the key reasons why ERISA was developed in the first \\\\nplace was the disparate rules and patchwork of State \\\\nregulation, and allowing ERISA preemption to stand will \\\\nencourage employers to be able to be responsive to their \\\\nworkforce needs in the areas that the--as we talked about, the \\\\ndata show.\\\\n    I also think the ability to access and utilize data as \\\\noutlined in HIPAA is incredibly important. In addition, I think \\\\nthe fiduciary obligations are incredibly important, that as \\\\nemployers work to administer their health plans, they are doing \\\\nso in the best interest of their participants and \\\\nbeneficiaries.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Thank you. Mr. DuBose, this Committee \\\\nhas championed legislation to increase transparency, lower \\\\ncosts, and encourage innovation in the health care market. Last \\\\nyear the Committee passed my legislation, the Telehealth \\\\nBenefit Expansion for Workers Act, which allows employers to \\\\noffer a standalone accepted telehealth benefit to all \\\\nemployees, which they were able to do during the COVID-19 \\\\npandemic successfully.\\\\n    What current barriers do employers face in offering \\\\ntelehealth services, and how would a separate telehealth \\\\nbenefit help your company and your employees?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Thank you, Representative Walberg. The barriers \\\\nemployers face with telehealth is--I believe the issues we face \\\\nis with our providers. We have employees that live in multi-\\\\nstates. Our salespeople travel from State to State when they \\\\nvisit with clients, and when we are using our telehealth \\\\nresources, our providers may not be licensed in the states in \\\\nwhich our members either are living or traveling in.\\\\n    We take the approach that to solve that barrier perhaps we \\\\nshould flip the script, and the provider--the State licensure \\\\nshould be based on where that provider is located. For example, \\\\nif we change the licensure in Alabama, where our provider is \\\\nlocated, and then that licensure would actually cover those \\\\nplan members regardless of their domicile, or their traveling \\\\nstatus. That would alleviate the gaps that are created by the \\\\nprovider not having proper State licensure in other states.\\\\n    To support our facilities in California, for example, we \\\\nhad to license our providers in Alabama in the other states \\\\njust to access our own employees, as an example, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. Okay. A number of responses to the Committee&#x27;s \\\\nrequest for information cited burdensome State regulations of \\\\ntelehealth. What can be done under ERISA to lessen that burden \\\\nin a greater way?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. We believe that ERISA provides the proper \\\\nframework to allow us to be flexible. I would say threats to \\\\nERISA at the State level, our ability to have ERISA preemption \\\\nis paramount to having that success and to be able to improve \\\\non the offerings that we already have. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Ms. Mancino, in your research you have \\\\nconvened panels of employers who are struggling to offer good \\\\nhealth benefits to their employees in this market. Undoubtedly, \\\\nyou have heard many complaints and concerns from them. What is \\\\nthe top concern you heard from employers and how would Congress \\\\naddress it?\\\\n    Ms. Mancino. Thank you for your question, Representative, I \\\\nappreciate the opportunity to give this answer. I think through \\\\nour research the top concern has to do with access to data and \\\\ninformation in order to make the choices that they need in \\\\ndesigning a health benefit plan. As we heard from other \\\\nwitnesses, TPAs are placing restrictions on access to \\\\nemployer&#x27;s data, which prohibits and inhibits, employer&#x27;s \\\\nability to understand cost and quality drivers within their own \\\\npopulations.\\\\n    Then they then struggle to compare that to other like-\\\\nsized, like-situated employers. Without Congress stepping in to \\\\nprovide access to that data, I think that there is--employers \\\\nwill remain challenged in designing benefits that will meet the \\\\nneeds of their populations.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. Thank you. I have gone way over, and I \\\\napologize Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Walberg, because I do not \\\\nhave to say remember to stay within your time for everybody. \\\\nThank you, Mr. Walberg, and now I yield to Mr. Courtney from \\\\nCalifornia for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually, coming \\\\nfrom a district which is home to the Yukon Huskies, I would \\\\njust note that I am not from California. I represent Storrs, \\\\nConnecticut where the men&#x27;s--that is right. Yes. Anyway, thank \\\\nyou to the witnesses for being here, and I am again also \\\\npleased that we are--taking a moment to reflect on the 50 years \\\\nthat ERISA has been on the books, and ways that we can build on \\\\nit and improve it.\\\\n    During my time here, I think the most striking reform was \\\\nin 2010 when we passed the Affordable Care Act, which via the \\\\nPublic Health Service Act amended ERISA to put in really some \\\\nof the most powerful patient protections, eliminating \\\\npreexisting condition exclusions, ending the practice of \\\\nlifetime limits, allowing the children of covered employees to \\\\nstay on their parents&#x27; health plan until age 26. All of that \\\\nwas because Congress had the boldness to resist all the \\\\nnegative pressure to get those measures through.\\\\n    Today, I mean, I think they are just sort of viewed as a \\\\ngiven in terms of the way plans operate. I also would just note \\\\nthat a few weeks ago the Republican Study Committee released \\\\ntheir 2025, sort of budget alternative, and included in it was \\\\na proposal to cap the tax exclusion for--employer-sponsored \\\\nhealth plans.\\\\n    Again, we are not the Ways and Means Committee. We are \\\\ntalking about other issues here today, but you know, we went \\\\nthrough the Cadillac tax fight, which was a bad part of the \\\\nACA. We managed to keep pushing it off before it actually took \\\\neffect, and in 2019 a bill, which I was the lead sponsor on, \\\\npassed the House 419 to 6, to strip the Cadillac tax from the \\\\ntax code.\\\\n    To this day, it still remains a tax-excluded benefit. \\\\nAgain, for some of you who are in the business, can you sort of \\\\ncomment in terms of what the impact of capping the tax \\\\nexclusion would have in terms of creating really unfair and \\\\ninequitable and, you know, outcomes by region where costs are \\\\ndifferent, health care costs are different.\\\\n    I see you nodding your head, Mr. Behrens, maybe you can \\\\ncomment.\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. Yes. First of all, thank you very much for \\\\nyour leadership on helping eliminate the Cadillac tax. It was \\\\nrather problematic, and it is simply the other side of the coin \\\\nof limiting the exclusion. We believe that when you look at the \\\\nhealth care landscape, one of the things you alluded to is that \\\\na lot of the cost differentials, a lot of the high costs are \\\\ndriven by geography.\\\\n    A lot of the high costs are driven by certain care \\\\nconditions. Yes. In the data it shows that costs for women tend \\\\nto be higher than costs for men. If your plan population is \\\\nsuch that you have certain characteristics in it, your costs \\\\nare going to be more. That is not necessarily because you are \\\\nproviding excess benefits, or anything extemporaneous that does \\\\nnot need to be in there, it is just a matter of fact.\\\\n    Changes to the exclusion could have a very negative impact, \\\\nsimilar to what we expected to see if the Cadillac tax would \\\\nhave gone.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. Right. Thank you. Again, when that proposal \\\\nwas released a couple weeks ago, the Alliance to Fight for \\\\nHealthcare, which was a really interesting coalition of \\\\nemployers, as well as other fiduciaries and beneficiaries, \\\\nwhether it is Taft-Hartley plans, others all have actually \\\\nstayed together since the Cadillac tax repealed, immediately \\\\nissued a statement saying we do not want to go down this \\\\npathway. Mr. Chairman, I would ask again, that their statement \\\\nbe entered for the record.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Without objection.\\\\n    [The Information of Mr. Courtney follows:]\\\\n    \\\\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] \\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Courtney. In my remaining time again, just to go back \\\\nto the question in terms of the disclosure and transparency \\\\nissue, Ms. Handorf, I think again, you have heard the exchange \\\\nhere before in terms of just how, you know, particularly third-\\\\nparty entities, there is a need for more transparency in terms \\\\nof helping with the way plans operate and cost.\\\\n    Maybe you could just comment on that in my remaining 40 \\\\nseconds.\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Yes. I think that one of the real problems \\\\nright now with health care is that there is a veil of secrecy. \\\\nMost of the PBMs and the TPAs will not give employers \\\\ninformation that they need. When you do find out information, \\\\nyou find out that there are no rules, really that they are \\\\nplaying by.\\\\n    Until you get transparency and some ability for plans to be \\\\nable to get that information, we will not be able to fix the \\\\ncost of care.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Courtney. I will now \\\\nrecognize myself for 5 minutes. I will remind the witnesses to \\\\npull the microphones a little bit closer if you would. Mr. \\\\nDuBose, I found your testimony most interesting as you \\\\ndescribed some of the great work that Phifer has done to \\\\nprovide outstanding benefits, a quality work life experience \\\\nfor your team members.\\\\n    You have taken great efforts and steps for the mutual \\\\nbenefit, well-being and cost savings of the organization and \\\\nyour team members, and the government did not make you do any \\\\nof it. You guys did it on your own, so you are to be commended \\\\nfor that. More specifically, your written testimony notes the \\\\nways that your company has used telehealth, so that patients \\\\nacross the country, particularly in rural areas have access to \\\\nimportant health care services.\\\\n    Can you discuss this a little further, how telehealth has \\\\nhelped you expand access to care, while also delivering lower \\\\ncost and lower premiums to your plan participants?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. During the pandemic we noticed many of our \\\\nrural families suffered from a lack of transportation and \\\\naccess, as providers were inundated with patients. We developed \\\\nan internal telehealth solution with our own onsite health care \\\\nclinic and offered 24/7 telemedicine to all of our family \\\\nmembers, so we were able to provide additional access from \\\\ntheir homes and created opportunities to improve their well-\\\\nbeing.\\\\n    The framework that ERISA allows us to be innovative, it is \\\\nfoundational for us to where we can create new policies and new \\\\ntechniques to protect our plan members, so the protections \\\\nafforded by ERISA allow us to be innovative and expand.\\\\n    Now, we provide telemedicine to all of our plan members. We \\\\nfound, for example, prior to that Sunday afternoons we had the \\\\nhighest emergency department use. Then, since we adopted \\\\ntelehealth, we eliminated many admits to emergency departments \\\\non Sunday afternoon. We found actual, tangible benefits by \\\\nexpanding telehealth to our plan members.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Very good. Are there any barriers you are \\\\nfacing now, any obstacles to continue to provide telehealth \\\\nbenefits to your employees since COVID expired? The pandemic \\\\nhas expired. What obstacles are you facing now?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. The current system is working well, as some of \\\\nthose provisions that are up for expiration, we are opposed to \\\\nthat. We want to see telehealth continue. We have found that \\\\ntelehealth has a very remarkable place in providing support for \\\\nmedical management, chronic disease management.\\\\n    There is a sweet spot for telemedicine, so we find that \\\\nthreats to ERISA allow us to--create harm for our telemedicine \\\\nbenefits because it would limit access that are plan members \\\\ncurrently enjoy.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Very good. Thank you. Mr. Behrens, despite \\\\nefforts by democrats and many on the left to try to force \\\\nsingle payer health care over the last 15 years or so, more \\\\nAmericans have private health insurance than Medicare or \\\\nMedicaid, or other Obamacare plans.\\\\n    Over half of Americans, I think you might have been the one \\\\nwho noted, have employer-sponsored health insurance. ERISA&#x27;s \\\\npreemption clause allows multi-State employers to follow ERISA \\\\nrather than all states laws, and this provides the regulatory \\\\nframework to maintain competition, the free market.\\\\n    If ERISA preemption is eroded, how would this impact \\\\nemployer-sponsored benefits?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. I think there are several ways that it would \\\\nimpact employers. I mean one of the first ways is additional \\\\ncosts, and additional plan administration, especially in the \\\\nworkforce that we have with a lot of remote workers now \\\\nconsider a small employer.\\\\n    Employer in Kansas City, you have got a grocery store that \\\\nhas employees in Kansas, in Missouri, and you might have some \\\\nadministrative employees elsewhere. If you were required to \\\\ncomply with a whole bunch of different State laws, that would \\\\nmake things much more difficult for employers.\\\\n    It would also tie their hands on innovation, and the \\\\nability to be flexible and make changes quickly. For instance, \\\\nin the pandemic we saw that employers were able to quickly \\\\nadapt more telehealth benefits, were able to quickly amend \\\\ntheir plans to provide more benefits for behavioral health care \\\\nas well as testing and treatment, and so those flexibilities \\\\nwould be gone.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Would you be concerned if ERISA preemption \\\\nwas eliminated or faded away, that our country would move more \\\\nclosely toward a single payer system?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. Absolutely.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you very much. With that, I yield back \\\\nand recognize Mr. Norcross from New Jersey for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Thank you, Chairman and to the witnesses for \\\\ncoming here today to talk about ERISA, which few people outside \\\\nthis room really understand, and certainly from what it has \\\\ndone for both workers and employers over the years, I think it \\\\nis a job well done, but also it means that there are some \\\\nthings that we can do to certainly improve it.\\\\n    One of those, and I know the Ranking Member talked about \\\\nmental health illnesses and some of the impact. It is common \\\\ntoday. It is probably as common as it was before, but now it is \\\\nout in the open that we can have this discussion about that, \\\\nand the stigma surrounding mental health is dropping, certainly \\\\nnot to where it needs to be, but it&#x27;s going on.\\\\n    The numbers are 1 in 5 adults have some form of mental \\\\nillness. ERISA&#x27;s Advisory Council issued a report examining the \\\\nbarriers that workers face to accessing their long-term \\\\ndisability or LTD. Ms. Handorf, could you briefly talk about \\\\nthe impact of not offering adequate long-term disability \\\\ncoverage for those dealing with mental health or substance use \\\\ndisorder, on workers and their family?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. I do not believe that mental health is treated \\\\nthe same way with disabilities as it is with health care. Many \\\\ndisability plans limit disability benefits if you are suffering \\\\nfrom mental health problems to 24 months, which and on the \\\\nother hand, it is endless for other types of health care \\\\ndisabilities.\\\\n    Well, mental health disabilities are no different than \\\\nhealth care disabilities. They both make it impossible for the \\\\nworker to work. If we really want parity in mental health, we \\\\nneed to make it apply to mental health, to long-term disability \\\\nplans, as well as to health plans, and that would serve a very \\\\nimportant purpose.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Certainly, the Parity Act, which talks about \\\\nthe enforcement mechanism that the Department of Labor could \\\\nuse because right now we have the speed limits, but nobody is \\\\nobeying them, and there is no real recourse, so we want to make \\\\nsure we do that.\\\\n    Let me just switch gears here a little bit, and the \\\\ndiscussion on whether or not we tax our benefits, particularly \\\\nin health benefits, has been around for years. There has \\\\nunfortunately been some more discussion. I say unfortunately \\\\nbecause I believe it would have a negative impact on what \\\\nemployers and employees would do.\\\\n    Mr. Behrens, if this happens, and that is a huge if, that \\\\nwe take away the tax status for our health plans, what do you \\\\nthink happens to the market? Not so much going to the single \\\\nemployer, or do they just turn it over to the employees and say \\\\ngo find your own?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. I think one of the first things that happens, \\\\nobviously if you change the rules around the exclusion, you&#x27;re \\\\nraising taxes. Workers will have less money in their paycheck. \\\\nI think the idea is that it would change health care, reduce \\\\nhealth care costs, but we do not envision that happening based \\\\non the information that we have, the plans that we work with.\\\\n    We think employers are actively working on behalf of their \\\\nemployers to provide good benefits that are in alignment with \\\\nwhat the workers need. If the exclusion goes away, some of \\\\nthose benefits will go away, and so plans will get skinnier and \\\\nnarrower, and be less beneficial to workers and their families.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Thank you, and it is, I think, worth noting \\\\nthat when we look at tax breaks in general, the vast majority \\\\ngoes to those in a higher income bracket. This is what I call \\\\nthe working man&#x27;s tax break. It helps in two ways. It helps \\\\nthem in their health care, mental health care, because they \\\\nwill now be covered.\\\\n    If thrown back to an employee, they have to make those \\\\ntough choices each and every day, do I pay for sneakers for my \\\\nkid going to school, or do I keep my health benefits? Those are \\\\ndecisions unfortunately that are very real.\\\\n    We believe that the idea of that exemption is the core for \\\\nordinary working men and women. Keep that. Let them have their \\\\ntax break while you take your zillion dollar tax breaks on the \\\\nother side. This is the working man&#x27;s tax break. With that, I \\\\nyield back.\\\\n    Mr. Allen [presiding]. Alright. The gentleman yields. I now \\\\nrecognize myself to ask questions. Over 40 years ago my wife \\\\nand I took our savings and started a construction company. As \\\\nthe company grew, we were able to offer employee health \\\\ninsurance, which was not only a great benefit to our employees, \\\\nbut it was certainly critical to recruiting and retaining \\\\ntalent.\\\\n    This year we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the \\\\nEmployment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, also known \\\\nas ERISA. I am pleased that we are convening today&#x27;s hearing to \\\\nexplore avenues to continue to enable small and large \\\\nbusinesses alike to offer consistent and high-quality health \\\\ncare plans to employees nationwide.\\\\n    However, there is more that Congress can do to expand and \\\\nstrengthen this law, such as allowing self-employed individuals \\\\nto be covered under ERISA. Helping small businesses ban \\\\ntogether to offer insurance to their employees, like we passed \\\\nin the House, passed the Choice Act last year, and reforming \\\\nstem therapy.\\\\n    Right now, the government is running all of health care. \\\\nMr. DuBose, what would it look like if under the Affordable \\\\nCare Act unions and the faith-based community were given \\\\nwaivers to run their own health care plans without--basically \\\\nprivately, without government interference.\\\\n    What would it look like if ERISA, along with folks, self-\\\\nemployed folks able to participate in ERISA, what would it look \\\\nlike if ERISA got the same waivers, and companies like yours \\\\nwere able to run your programs without having to answer to HHS \\\\nand CMS?\\\\n    Mr. Dubose. Thank you, Representative Allen. We believe \\\\nERISA provides a minimum set of protections through its \\\\nframework that allows us to innovate consistently in our multi-\\\\nState plan. That is very important to us. If those guardrails \\\\nwere to change, then I believe that would create risk for our \\\\nplan design, and ultimately would harm our working families.\\\\n    We support that. If we no longer had to report to CMS on \\\\nour pharmacy data, and those type things, I would suspect we \\\\nwould even be more innovative in the way that we craft our \\\\nplans to further lower cost for all of our plan members.\\\\n    Mr. Allen. Well, that is the idea is to lower costs, and \\\\nthat is what at least we know the faith-based community better \\\\nknown Medi Share offers to folks. We passed the Lower Cost More \\\\nTransparency Act in December, which was intended to improve \\\\ntransparency in PBMs, so what is your opinion of the bill and \\\\nproposals to improve the transparency?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. It is a fantastic bill. We support the \\\\ntransparency aspects. I will say that we do urge Congress to go \\\\nfurther. There needs to be PBM reform, especially in regard to \\\\nspread pricing, and rebate pass through. There are practices \\\\nwithin those industries that ultimately create higher costs for \\\\nour working families, and we urge Congress to consider \\\\naddressing those issues.\\\\n    Mr. Allen. Thank you. Mr. Behrens, as employees look for \\\\nways to control health care costs, it is amazing that people \\\\nwho benefit by selling new tactics in the name of cost savings, \\\\nlike alternative funding programs, or AFPs, or taking advantage \\\\nof employers by not giving them the full picture. In your \\\\nopinion, should plan sponsors be required to clearly inform \\\\nenrollees of the existence of an AFP, and the specific \\\\nconditions the program impacts?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. When it comes to AFPs or any of the \\\\nprescription drug models, I believe ERISA&#x27;s disclosure \\\\nrequirements already require that information be provided about \\\\nthat. I will tell you from our experience, employers tend to \\\\nshy away from those types of programs simply because of the \\\\nchallenges that employees face with having to comply with \\\\nthose, and some of the risks related to them.\\\\n    Mr. Allen. I want to thank you also, Ms. Mancino, for \\\\nsharing the--your thoughts on telehealth and Mr. DuBose, so \\\\nthat is critical to health care. I am out of time, and so I \\\\nyield back. Ms. Jayapal, you are recognized for questions.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our health care \\\\nsystem is broken, and the high costs are crushing workers. \\\\nMeanwhile, CEOs of big insurance companies rake in billions of \\\\ndollars in profits, and their executives make tens of millions. \\\\nWhen Democrats held the majority in the House, we worked to \\\\nimprove regulation of big insurance, and lower health care \\\\ncosts for workers.\\\\n    In the Affordable Care Act, we capped the total out of \\\\npocket costs allowed in health insurance plans, and in the \\\\nInflation Reduction Act we went further, and capped the out-of-\\\\npocket costs for prescriptions at $2,000.00 for people on \\\\nMedicare, and that will begin in just a few months.\\\\n    Now, President Biden has called for extending that cap to \\\\neveryone who has insurance to make big insurance pay its fair \\\\nshare of medical costs. My colleagues across the aisle have \\\\nadvocated for repealing many of these health insurance laws and \\\\ndecreasing regulation of big insurance.\\\\n    Ms. Handorf, in your testimony you discovered how current \\\\nlaw allows insurance companies that administer group health \\\\nplans to avoid the regulations in the Employee Retirement \\\\nIncome Security Act. Can you provide examples of how this has \\\\naffected workers in their real lives?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Yes. I think that by not providing the \\\\ninformation that is necessary for fiduciaries to control costs \\\\nand find out how things are actually being run, it has caused--\\\\nI represent two Taft-Hartley plans in Connecticut, who tried to \\\\nget their plan data from Elevance, and were not given the data.\\\\n    They wanted it because in one of the plans the plan had to \\\\nincrease the deductible so high that their members were not \\\\ngoing to the doctor. They were not taking the medications \\\\nbecause they could not afford it. That is why they wanted to \\\\nfind out what was happening.\\\\n    They reached a stone wall. We actually had to file a case \\\\nin Federal court to get that information, which has not yet \\\\nbeen resolved. When you do find out what happens, you find out \\\\nthat the claims are not being paid in accordance with the \\\\nnegotiated rates. That there are fees that are being hidden \\\\nfrom the plans, and that there is just no rhyme, no reason how \\\\nthese plans are being operated.\\\\n    Unless ERISA makes it clear that these TPAs are \\\\nfiduciaries, or at least gives access to employers the \\\\ninformation they need, and somehow is able to balance the \\\\nbargaining power between the insurer and the plans, it is just \\\\ngoing to continue the way it has been.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. And given the lack of regulation of big \\\\ninsurance, can you tell me how health care costs for employers \\\\nand for employees have changed over the past decade?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Yes. Well, as costs have gone up, and there is \\\\nno question the costs have gone up, employers are finding ways \\\\nin which to share those costs with employees, who already have \\\\ngiven up some of their wages in order to get health insurance.\\\\n    You see in a lot of instances, the deductibles going up \\\\nvery high, to the point where if you have a huge deductible, \\\\nyou are not going to go to the doctor.\\\\n    It immediately affects them. Then when you have things like \\\\nwhat the New York Times reported, it also affects employees in \\\\nthe sense that they get stuck with bills that they should not \\\\nbe stuck with because the insurers are claiming 30 percent of \\\\nthe savings by repricing the claims. All of these practices \\\\nhurt participants, and I do not think we know the extent of \\\\nthem without more information.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. What recourse do workers have if their medical \\\\ncare is denied by their group health plan? Is it easy to \\\\nnavigate the appeals process under ERISA?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Unfortunately, no. No. 1, it is very hard for \\\\nparticipants to get health care lawyers to take their claims \\\\nbecause they are big claims. The lawyer will not be compensated \\\\nfor the work in the internal appeals procedure where the record \\\\nis made, and so there is a limit to what the record can be.\\\\n    Then sometimes they ask for records, and the plan will not \\\\ngive it to them, so it makes it very difficult for them to \\\\nassert their rights to benefits. Their doctors usually know \\\\nwhat is happening, but their doctors cannot bring a claim \\\\nbecause there are anti-assignment provisions in the plan \\\\ndocuments. There are all kinds of barriers.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. Of barriers, yes. It does not sound like with \\\\nthese increased costs that they are getting better care or \\\\nbenefits.\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. No. I do not believe so.\\\\n    Ms. Jayapal. When left unregulated big insurance increases \\\\ncosts and decreases care for people. That is what I am seeing \\\\nfrom my constituents every single day, and it is really \\\\nimportant that we continue to pass policies that reign in big \\\\ninsurance, and work toward affordable health care for everyone, \\\\nlike my Medicare-for-All Act. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield \\\\nback, Madam Chair, I yield back.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx [presiding]. Thank you. Mr. Bean, you are \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Bean. Madam Chair, very good morning to you, and good \\\\nmorning HELP Committee, to our witnesses. We are glad to have \\\\nyou in our Nation&#x27;s capital. We are talking health insurance, \\\\nand the efficient delivery thereof. Mr. Behrens, you said do \\\\nnot do any harm, and I understand that.\\\\n    Here is our first question. Earlier this year a bipartisan \\\\ngroup, 39 State Attorney Generals, including Attorney General \\\\nAshley Moody of my free State of Florida, wrote to Congress, \\\\nurging us to take action on pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs.\\\\n    Their letter outlined several PBM practices, such as spread \\\\npricing and tying compensation to the list pricing of a \\\\nmedicine. According to these AGs, the practices affect patients \\\\nand important stakeholders, employers, and community \\\\npharmacists, and also could increase the cost of health care \\\\ndelivery.\\\\n    Ms. Mancino, what say you? What should we be doing? Is \\\\nthere a problem with PBMs, and what are your thoughts on it.\\\\n    Ms. Mancino. Thank you so much for your question. I think \\\\nit is really important that Congress do two things in this \\\\narea. Based on our research, we feel as though Congress needs \\\\nto provide vendors, and clarify that vendors such as PBMs have \\\\nclear obligations to current ERISA fiduciaries.\\\\n    If you provide that type of guidance, I think that the \\\\nmarket can take that information and will--it will improve the \\\\nvisibility and the understanding of contracting terms that \\\\nexist in that market. I also think that it is important that \\\\nCongress provide additional clarification and tools to current \\\\nfiduciaries, including empowering them with access to \\\\nmeaningful data to carry out their roles.\\\\n    Mr. Bean. Mr. Behrens, Ms. Mancino says action is needed \\\\nfirst of all. Is there a PBM problem? Two, what should we do \\\\nabout it if there is?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. I think one of the--I think she is exactly \\\\nright. Additional transparency will be very helpful, and so \\\\nwe----\\\\n    Mr. Bean. There is a problem. There is a problem.\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. There is a problem with the lack of \\\\ntransparency, with the opaqueness, and many times we also see, \\\\nas Ms. Handorf has mentioned, as well, lack of transparency \\\\naround fees. In addition, and so holding them to account to \\\\nprovide that fee information under 408(b) 2 of ERICA, the \\\\nindirect and direct compensation would be beneficial.\\\\n    Mr. Bean. More sunshine is the answer. Is that the answer, \\\\nMr. Behrens?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. It is part of the answer.\\\\n    Mr. Bean. Very good. When you leave your job, if you were \\\\nto leave your job, and now I think it is an average of seven \\\\ntimes that millennials leave their job, even more than that, \\\\nthat the average as of a few years ago was seven times. Do you \\\\nknow when you leave your job you always have to find new health \\\\ninsurance, but you do not have to find new house insurance. You \\\\ndo not have to find new car insurance.\\\\n    Is it time that we create a market out there where people \\\\ncan be responsible for their own health care? How great would \\\\nit be to see a commercial saying 15 minutes could save you 15 \\\\npercent on your health insurance, or so easy a caveman can do \\\\nit, and let people make their own decisions.\\\\n    Is that a good idea? Is it past time that we start our own \\\\nhealth care market where people can make their own decisions, \\\\nand have their own health insurance without going through their \\\\nemployer? I throw that out as a toss-up question. Mr. DuBose, \\\\njump in.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. In practice, I do not think it is applicable \\\\nyet because the players in health care, even if it is a new \\\\ninsurer, a new provider, those actors, the simple matter of \\\\nfact is many of the goods and services are just overpriced, so \\\\nthose same problems are going to creep up.\\\\n    Mr. Bean. If we had a free market, a free market with some \\\\nof the same protections that ERISA has given employers, would \\\\nthat be just a better way to go? It is kicking our tail right \\\\nnow. The health care costs are eating our lunch financially, \\\\nand so is it time to do something different? We have done it \\\\nthis way for so long, but what can we do different?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens, what do you think about this new concept where \\\\npeople control their own health care?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. I think there are a lot of ways people are \\\\nable to. They have the choice. If you are leaving employment, \\\\nyou have the choice of continuing.\\\\n    Mr. Bean. Your choice is to take the company plan, or not \\\\ntake the company plan?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. You have got the choice of enrolling on the \\\\nACA marketplaces; you have got the choice of enrolling \\\\npotentially in a short-term limited duration plan. You have got \\\\nthe opportunity, depending on your eligibility, to enroll in \\\\nMedicare or Medicaid. I think there are options out there, and \\\\nI think fundamentally there are still challenges with each one \\\\nof those options.\\\\n    Mr. Bean. Yes. You are saying go to Baskin Robbins and just \\\\ntake vanilla, and that is it. Hopefully we can have a general \\\\ndiscussion, keep going forward and think differently. Mr. \\\\nChairman, I yield back. Thank you very much. Great Discussion.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Bean. Ms. Manning, you are \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to our \\\\nwitnesses, and Mr. Bean, I just must say I love your \\\\nenthusiasm. I agree with you that people should be able to get \\\\ntheir own health care, and that is why we passed the Affordable \\\\nCare Act, and that is why in my State, I am so thrilled that we \\\\nfinally, after all these years, decided to take Medicaid \\\\nexpansion, so that people could afford their own health care.\\\\n    I just want to use this to say Mr. Behrens, thank you for \\\\nmentioning the Affordable Care Act, because it is such a \\\\ncritically important component of what people can now use to \\\\nget their own health care.\\\\n    Ms. Handorf, the Biden administration finalized an \\\\nimportant rule that would roll back the Trump administration&#x27;s \\\\nexpansion of short-term limited duration insurance. Some would \\\\ncall it junk health insurance.\\\\n    I have recently had an experience with a constituent in my \\\\ndistrict who thought she had good health insurance, because she \\\\nhad gotten one of those short-term limited duration insurance \\\\nplans, and then when she got sick, she learned it did not cover \\\\nanything.\\\\n    I know that these plans serve as a stopgap but were \\\\nexpanded far beyond the purpose by the Trump administration. \\\\nCan you talk to us about how these plans differ from ACA-\\\\ncompliant coverage?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Well, one of the things they do is they do not \\\\ncover pre-existing conditions, so that if you have a pre-\\\\nexisting condition you are not going to be able to get care for \\\\nthat. It also limits the type of benefits that you can get. I \\\\nbelieve mental health benefits are limited. Pregnancy benefits \\\\nare limited.\\\\n    You are not getting the same quality that you would get \\\\notherwise. I think there are a lot of marketing techniques that \\\\nmake it sound like you are getting a lot more than what you are \\\\nactually getting, so the value does not add up to what the cost \\\\nis.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. In many circumstances these plans offer false \\\\npromise to consumers?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Yes. They offer false promise.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. An important protection that was established \\\\nby the Affordable Care Act is that it allows consumers to seek \\\\nan external review of the adverse benefits determinations by \\\\ntheir health plan or insurer. This is important because it gets \\\\npeople access to an independent review of their situation while \\\\navoiding having to go through the court system.\\\\n    I think, as you noted in your testimony, the time it takes \\\\nfor an external review can have tragic results. How can this \\\\nprocess be improved?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Well, the process can be improved. The law is \\\\nthere to give you a prompt external review, but if people do \\\\nnot follow it, there are no consequences, as the case I pointed \\\\nout in the Rose case where----\\\\n    Ms. Manning. There are actually no penalties if the rules \\\\nare not followed?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Exactly, because there are no penalties, and \\\\nthe participant is limited in what relief they can get.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Do you believe that independent review \\\\norganizations for self-insured plans have the potential for a \\\\nconflict of interest?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. They do if you leave them in the hands of--I \\\\nthink that with any review process in ERISA, when you have the \\\\nsame reviewers over and over again, who want to be employed, \\\\nthey tend to give a decision that is going to make sure that \\\\nthey get chosen the next time.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Thank you. Ms. Mancino, you mentioned that the \\\\nlack of competition resulting from the consolidation of \\\\nhospital systems can have an impact on costs. I know that in my \\\\nown district, the pressure on our major hospital system to \\\\nmerge with a larger system is enormous, so that they can get \\\\nmore leverage to negotiate to achieve lower costs.\\\\n    I am concerned that mergers and consolidations actually \\\\nprovide worse care for my constituents. Can you talk about how \\\\nwe should be addressing that difficult balance?\\\\n    Ms. Mancino. Thank you very much for this important \\\\nquestion. I think that the role that Congress can play here \\\\ntoday and in the future is to address anti-competitive behavior \\\\nthat exists in concentrated markets.\\\\n    We would really like this Committee to focus on continuing \\\\nto advance data transparency, codify price transparency, make \\\\nit clear that TPAs cannot hinder access to employer claims \\\\ndata.\\\\n    Encourage the administration to implement the bipartisan \\\\nadvanced explanation of benefits requirement and incentivize \\\\nemployers and health plans to contribute their health care \\\\nclaims data to multi-employer claims data bases to help drive \\\\nbetter purchasing and benefit design choices in concentrated \\\\nmarkets, and we think you should address anti-competitive \\\\ncontracting practices like prohibiting all or nothing, or anti-\\\\ntiering contracting practices.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Thank you. My time has expired. I yield back.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Ms. Manning. Mr. Burlison, you are \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuBose, you know \\\\nwhen I think about how messed up the health care system is, and \\\\nhow expensive it is, I cannot help but think about how this \\\\nplace has totally taken an industry and turned it into a \\\\nFrankenstein.\\\\n    That you have got a scenario that first when people used to \\\\nhave choice, then as my colleague was mentioning, at one point, \\\\nyou know, people do not go and shop for health insurance today \\\\nbecause it is being done by their employer, and why? The \\\\nemployer gets the tax benefit, and the employer is required to \\\\nprovide that.\\\\n    We have consolidated and taken away the choice for \\\\nemployees at a company and said, if you are going to get \\\\ninsurance that is subsidized, and you do not have to pay taxes \\\\non it, it is going to be through whoever the employer picks. Is \\\\nthat correct?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. In a self-insured plan that we have, we have \\\\nproviders. We do offer centers of excellence, and high-quality \\\\nproviders based on quality.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. I am not talking about the providers. I am \\\\ntalking about the network. The insurance network. You pick the \\\\nnetwork.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Yes. In Alabama we do have essentially one \\\\nnetwork, and we do add to that network through direct \\\\ncontracting, but in Alabama our network does cover all the \\\\nproviders in the State with our carrier, so we have a different \\\\nchoice proposition in our State.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. Right. At the end of the day, in order for \\\\nthe sake of providing this tax benefit, we have eliminated \\\\nchoice to the two individual insurers, right? Individual \\\\ncovered lives no longer have the same choice that they once \\\\ndid.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. I do not agree. We have a lot of good----\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. Not if they are going to get the same tax \\\\nbenefits.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. In Alabama the way our market works, the choice \\\\nthat we provide to our plan members is to go to the providers \\\\nof their choice within the totality of the network based on \\\\nquality, so we are able to navigate through innovation to those \\\\nbest of class providers.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. Right.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Let the plan members make that conscious \\\\nchoice, and informed decision to see the provider that they \\\\nfeel the most comfortable with, that has the best outcome, best \\\\nquality, best cost, so it is a decision that the plan member \\\\nneeds to make, but it needs to be an informed decision.\\\\n    It is not in our State, the network itself is not what is \\\\nin play, because all of our providers are in the same network.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. You understand that is not the way it is \\\\nacross America.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. It is not. It is different from State to State.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. Okay. In communities like mine there are \\\\nbasically two networks, and if you are a member of one, and \\\\nyour employer decides to go to the other, you have to leave \\\\ndoctors from one to the other. You are lucky. You are in a \\\\nGoldilocks community in that regard.\\\\n    OK, so my other question has to do with the difference \\\\nbetween the ERISA plans and the State regulated plans. What are \\\\nthe benefits that an employer receives to use an ERISA plan \\\\nover what is regulated by the state?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. The benefits for us for an ERISA plan is the \\\\nfact that we are able to offer our plans multi-State, and \\\\nremove variance, and make sure we have high quality plans that \\\\nare consistent with all of our plan members, regardless of \\\\ntheir location.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. Right.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. We create innovative, high-performing plans \\\\nbecause ERISA allows us that framework to excel as opposed to a \\\\nState plan that does not have those same luxuries.\\\\n    Mr. Burlinson. Right. I am hearing that while the ERISA \\\\nplan is preferrable, really what you are avoiding is a lot of \\\\nState mandates on insurance. Is that accurate?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. In Alabama, what we offer in our ERISA \\\\npreemption, in our ERISA covered plans, we believe we far--we \\\\nexcel. We far out-provide State provided plans.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. Oh, I am sure it could be better than just \\\\nsaying you have got one size fits all mandates, that sometimes \\\\na State implements that can be the tail that wags the dog.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. In the State of Alabama we do use our ERISA \\\\npreemption, so when the State does pass laws or policies, that \\\\nare unique to providers within the State, those are generally \\\\nfor State covered entities that are not ERISA covered plans.\\\\n    Mr. Burlison. Thank you.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Burlison. Ms. McBath, you are \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. McBath. Thank you so much, Chairwoman and Ranking \\\\nMember DeSaulnier, and your staff, and our witnesses that are \\\\nhere with us today. Thank you so much for making this hearing \\\\npossible for us. As I have shared with the Committee before, I \\\\nam a two-time breast cancer survivor, and the daughter of two \\\\nhealth care professionals.\\\\n    My father was a dentist, and my mother taught nursing at \\\\nHoward University Hospital. Health care, as you can see, is \\\\nvery, very personal to me, and I have seen this industry not \\\\nonly as a patient, and from the perspective also of a provider. \\\\nI know that there is still so much work that we can do together \\\\nto really ensure access to affordable health care for our \\\\nconstituents.\\\\n    I am glad to be here today as we look toward ERISA&#x27;s 50th \\\\nanniversary and reflect on ways to improve health care delivery \\\\nfor the folks that are counting on us back at home. Step \\\\ntherapy is an insurer, or pharmacy benefit manager, mandated \\\\nprotocol that requires patients to fail other treatments before \\\\nthey could take advantage of the actual medication recommended \\\\nby their doctors, that in most cases really is the best \\\\nmedication, but they have got work their way to get to that \\\\nmedication.\\\\n    Often failing medication can result in debilitating side \\\\neffects and irreversible disease progression. I will say that I \\\\nactually have gone through this with my own husband, who has \\\\nbeen diagnosed with a very rare autoimmune disease.\\\\n    Last time we gathered here to discuss employer-sponsored \\\\nhealth care, I shared how my husband was actually being stepped \\\\nthrough the wrong medication in order to obtain coverage for a \\\\ntherapy that our doctors knew would be better suited for his \\\\ntreatment.\\\\n    I am really proud to be working with Representatives \\\\nWenstrup, and Chavez-DeRemer on the Safe Step Act. Our bill \\\\nwould actually offer a streamlined procedure for processing \\\\nstep therapy exemption requests, and return these personal \\\\ndecisions to where they belong, with the patient, and with \\\\ntheir family and their health care provider.\\\\n    I know what it feels like to walk hand in hand with a sick \\\\nloved one. To see them go through the fear and the uncertainty \\\\nof their diagnosis. When someone you love is sick, all you want \\\\nto do is see them get the care, the medication, and the \\\\nservices and the support that they need to get better.\\\\n    The last thing anyone wants to hear is that their husband \\\\nor their sister or their child, their care is being jeopardized \\\\nin order to just kind of like check a box. Some patients simply \\\\ndo not have that luxury to wait, and I know in the case even \\\\nwith my husband, it was a matter of days really actually had we \\\\nnot been able to ascertain what disease he had, his disease can \\\\nbe fatal if not managed.\\\\n    I just want to say always we have to be thinking about the \\\\npatients&#x27; care foremost in mind because our patients really \\\\ncan&#x27;t wait. My question is for Ms. Handorf. Do you think it is \\\\nappropriate for pharmacy benefit managers to refuse to cover an \\\\nemployee&#x27;s treatment, even if it will result in irreversible \\\\nhealth outcomes or death?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. I think that costs usually end up driving \\\\ndecisions when they ought not to, and the bottom line should be \\\\nthat the benefits are for the participants&#x27; best health. I \\\\nthink that when pharmacy benefit managers control the \\\\npharmaceuticals that participants have access to, ultimately it \\\\ndoes not result in a good result because it is just going to \\\\ncost more in the long run.\\\\n    That&#x27;s of course, assuming that the patients live for the \\\\nsecond therapy, or the other drugs. I think there should be \\\\ncontrol of that situation.\\\\n    Mrs. McBath. Thank you for that. Can you talk a little bit \\\\nmore about pharmacy benefit managers, and how important it is \\\\nto have more transparency, which we have talked about that \\\\ntoday, but really if you would like to elaborate even more \\\\nabout the transparency for the American public when it comes to \\\\nwhat they do and the decisions that they make?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Well, I think that is very hard to understand \\\\nhow you can control costs if you do not know what your service \\\\nproviders and the TPAs are doing. I think that transparency is \\\\ndifficult to define right now because we do not even know what \\\\nwe are looking for that needs to be open to the public view.\\\\n    I think it is essential for employers to have equal \\\\nbargaining power with their service providers, in order to be \\\\nable to really control costs and provide good benefits.\\\\n    Mrs. McBath. Thank you so much for your testimony, and I \\\\nyield the balance of my time.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Ms. McBath. Ms. Hayes, you are \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you and thank you to our witnesses for \\\\ntestifying here today. I am happy to be here, however, I \\\\nrecognize that we are still just nibbling around the edges, and \\\\nwe need to address health care in this country, in a real and \\\\nmeaningful way.\\\\n    According to the Peterson KFF Health Systems Tracker, the \\\\nmajority of individuals under age 65 in the United States \\\\nreceive their health coverage through a job-based plan, \\\\nincluding more than 164 million workers and their family \\\\nmembers. While people are generally satisfied with their \\\\nemployer sponsored plan, the cost of health care is still far \\\\ntoo high for many.\\\\n    According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \\\\nServices, health care in the United States is among the highest \\\\nin the world, accounting for over $4.5 trillion in 2022. Those \\\\nare policy choices. Despite this spending, we have worse health \\\\noutcomes than other developed nations. This Congress has had a \\\\nlarge focus on the lack of transparency in this market due to \\\\npharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.\\\\n    This Committee even marked up legislation included in the \\\\nbipartisan Lower Cost More Transparency Act, which would \\\\nimprove transparency regarding PBM rebates. Employers who \\\\nsponsor health plans are often unable to determine the basics \\\\nof how PBMs make decisions with respect to their plans.\\\\n    With respect to their plans, prescription drug benefits, \\\\nincluding rebates they earn, and whether those rebates pose a \\\\nconflict of interest that raises costs for workers and their \\\\nfamilies. Mr. DuBose, in your testimony you pointed out the \\\\nneed for Federal standards for PBMs. How do rebates impact how \\\\na PBM designs a formulary?\\\\n    Additionally, how does that affect consumers in terms of \\\\ntheir premiums and out of pocket costs?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Thank you, Representative Hayes. Yes, we \\\\nbelieve the PBMs, they control the formularies. When it comes \\\\nto pharmacy costs for an employer-based plan, the formulary is \\\\nthe driver of those expenses.\\\\n    We have seen, and which was a reason we moved to a midsize, \\\\ntransparent PBM, it is because the placement of some of those \\\\nformulary items are driven by the rebate model, as opposed to \\\\nlowest net cost. We encourage our fellow employers and plan \\\\nsponsors to focus on lower net cost because at the end of the \\\\nday that equals lower costs, lower premiums, for plan members.\\\\n    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. According to the Drug Channels \\\\nInstitute in 2023, 80 percent of all equivalent prescription \\\\nclaims were processed by three companies, CVS Health, Express \\\\nScripts, through Cigna and Optim RX through United Health \\\\nGroup.\\\\n    Like many others on this Committee, I constantly hear from \\\\nconstituents that they are either paying too much for \\\\nprescription drugs, or they cannot find the drugs they need \\\\nbecause of pharmacy consolidation.\\\\n    How does this market concentration impact the employer&#x27;s \\\\nleverage in negotiating for better health plans, and is \\\\nincreased transparency regarding PBM rebates enough to lower \\\\nhealth care costs, Mr. DuBose?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Yes. Representative Hayes, the recommendations \\\\nwe have outlined are necessary, but I do believe the fiduciary \\\\nrole of those PBMs is what is key to impact their behavior. If \\\\nthat happens, those other things that we have talked about, \\\\nbanning spread pricing. One of the Representatives mentioned \\\\ndelinking and rebate model control.\\\\n    Those types of things are necessary to change the business \\\\nmodel so that the prices become affordable to both the plan and \\\\nthe plan members.\\\\n    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I guess I will end my time, but I \\\\ngot very excited when I heard my colleague, Mr. Bean, talking \\\\nabout this idea that people could have health insurance that \\\\nwas not connected to an employer, and they would not have to \\\\nchange it all the time.\\\\n    I just think that that was just such a ringing endorsement \\\\nfor the whole idea of the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, that \\\\nwe really should concentrate some time on improving plans like \\\\nthat, so that people who will have multiple options, and that \\\\nall of those options will be both affordable and accessible, \\\\nand will not be contingent upon employment or geography, or \\\\nwhat community you are from.\\\\n    I really hope that we take the opportunity to improve the \\\\nsystems that we have in place to make them better for all to \\\\naccess. With that, I yield back. Thank you.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Ms. Hayes. I now recognize myself for \\\\n5 minutes. Mr. DuBose and Mr. Behrens, State laws regulating \\\\npharmacy benefit managers have been the vehicles for \\\\nlitigation, challenging the extent of ERISA preemption. \\\\nHowever, I cannot emphasize enough that protecting ERISA \\\\npreemption is not about regulating PBMs.\\\\n    Congress must understand how these State laws are the \\\\ncamel&#x27;s nose under the tent. How do these lawsuits impact other \\\\nservice providers, and other employee benefits under ERISA?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens.\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. Yes. I think you are exactly right that the \\\\nway that states are looking at the response to the Rutledge \\\\ndecision and applying the laws go well beyond PBM regulation. \\\\nIf the idea is that the states can subvert the rights of this \\\\nCongress to regulate employee benefit plans by regulating PBMs \\\\nor TPAs, then that&#x27;s going to have significant impacts.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Mr. DuBose.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. I agree that protecting ERISA preemption is not \\\\nabout the states in their attempts to regulate PBMs. I believe \\\\nERISA has always been to provide a self-insured employers a \\\\nFederal regulatory framework to provide great benefits to their \\\\nplan members. I just believe the states are reacting to a \\\\ncondition with pharmacy pricing. It&#x27;s their attempt to reign \\\\nthat pricing in.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Yes. I will start with you, Mr. DuBose. How \\\\nshould Congress both protect ERISA and ensure proper oversight \\\\nof PBMs?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. I think Congress and policy does a good job in \\\\nprotecting ERISA. I think the arguments made at the State level \\\\nare things that need to be addressed at the Federal level. \\\\nThings such as a PBM, site neutral payments, that Medicare is \\\\nproposing. Those type things are very important, and we support \\\\nthose, and if those things were managed and taken care of at \\\\nthe Federal level, then the states would not have to engage.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Mr. Behrens, do you have anything you would like \\\\nto add to that?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. I think transparency is certainly important \\\\nand helpful. I would argue that in addition to some of the \\\\nefforts that are already underway, ensuring that the \\\\ninformation we are asking PBMs to disclose is disclosed timely. \\\\nFor example, if we are merely asking for rights to audit PBMs, \\\\nthose audits are very difficult and expensive.\\\\n    We would prefer to see regular data feeds of that \\\\ninformation, so that it is actionable during the plan year. In \\\\naddition, when it comes to the fees, we believe that it is \\\\nimportant for PBMs, as well as TPAs, and others to disclose \\\\ntheir direct and indirect compensation.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you. Ms. Mancino, anti-competitive \\\\ncontract terms are becoming more common as the health care \\\\nmarket becomes increasingly consolidated. Do you believe that \\\\nthese anti-competitive practices inhibit a free market in \\\\nhealth care?\\\\n    Ms. Mancino. Thank you for your question, Chairwoman. Yes. \\\\nWe do think that the market--the work that we see, and the \\\\nchallenges that employers face in the market, they are \\\\nchallenged to unlock competition and their purchasing power \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. How would you recommend Congress address this \\\\nanti-competitive behavior?\\\\n    Ms. Mancino. Congress can seek to address anti-competitive \\\\nbehavior in concentrated markets in two primary ways. Continue \\\\nto advance data transparency, codify the cost transparency \\\\nrequirements, push that further, make it clear that TPAs cannot \\\\nhinder access to employer claims data.\\\\n    Encourage the administration to implement the advanced \\\\nexplanation of benefits to give consumers actionable \\\\ninformation as they make care decisions and incentivize \\\\nemployers and health plans to contribute health care claims to \\\\nmulti-employer claims data bases to drive better purchasing and \\\\ndesign decisions. Finally, prohibit all or nothing, most \\\\nfavored nation, and anti-tiering contracting practices.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you very much. I have another question I \\\\nam wanting to ask, but I am about to run out of time. It has to \\\\ndo with hospital charging facility fees for telehealth \\\\nappointments. Mr. Behrens, would you give a very quick answer \\\\nto that issue?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. We are very skeptical of facility fees in \\\\ngeneral, specifically with respect to telehealth when the only \\\\nrequired technology is a phone line or internet connection.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you very much. Mr. Scott, you are \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Handorf, we have \\\\ntalked about transparency. One of the shortcomings of \\\\ntransparency is it is just the first step. I think you have \\\\nalluded to the fact that if you had transparency, a lot of \\\\npeople would not know what they were looking at. What does an \\\\nemployer know if he gets transparency?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Well, I think that that is a problem with the \\\\n408(b)(2) disclosures because if you are going to get fees \\\\nreported, you have to know that those actually are the fees \\\\nthat are being charged.\\\\n    What I think will happen is, if you get more access to the \\\\nclaims data you will be able to see how the fees are spent, how \\\\nthey are collected, and you will end up finding out more.\\\\n    I think that really the answer is to make the TPAs and the \\\\nPBMs fiduciaries under ERISA.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. How would making them fiduciaries improve \\\\nthings?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Well, it would make them responsible to the \\\\nparticipants and beneficiaries. They would have to follow the \\\\nfiduciary rules. They could not set their own compensation. \\\\nThey are basically running the health care plans anyway now, \\\\nand it would just put the responsibility where the power is, \\\\nand the liability where it belongs.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Thank you. You talked about denial of benefits. \\\\nWhen benefits are denied do consumers get a de novo right of \\\\nreview when they go to court?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. No. You get a discretionary standard review, \\\\nwhich means that even if the judge thinks that you are right, \\\\nif there is a reasonable basis for why the plan denied the \\\\nclaim, the court will have to affirm the denial. It really does \\\\nput a barrier in terms of people getting benefits, which is \\\\nwhat ERISA is designed to do, is to provide for those benefits.\\\\n    If we had a de novo review, the court would be looking at \\\\nthe record with a fresh eye and making a decision as to whether \\\\nor not the benefits should be provided.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. I know there are other barriers like arbitration \\\\nagreements that get in the way of consumers getting a fair day \\\\nin court. Are there other barriers, arbitration agreements, for \\\\nexample, that serve as a barrier to consumers getting their \\\\nfair day in court?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Yes. I understand that the employers want to \\\\ncontrol costs, but they put in their plan documents many things \\\\nthat keep participants from protecting their own rights, like \\\\nclass action waivers, arbitration provisions, venue provisions \\\\nthat cause people to have to go across the country to \\\\nadjudicate their claims.\\\\n    They are all designed to keep people from protecting their \\\\ninterest. It is hard enough for employees to get representation \\\\nin ERISA cases. These make it even more difficult.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. It is hard to get representation because we know \\\\nthe claims are only a few thousand dollars, then you cannot \\\\nafford an attorney if that is all that is at stake, is that \\\\nright?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. That is correct. Usually, the claim will not \\\\nbe great enough that it makes sense for a lawyer to pursue the \\\\nclaim, so by allowing individuals to join together in a class \\\\naction, they are able to effectively get relief for everybody.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. If the person--if the customer is successful, \\\\nwho pays the attorney&#x27;s fee?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. In a class action it comes out of the recovery \\\\nfrom the plan.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. If there is no class action if it is an \\\\nindividual claim?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. With an individual claim it still comes out of \\\\nthe recovery, but what it does is it allows people to get \\\\nlawyers who they otherwise could not get.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. That is if there is a class action?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Yes. There is a lot of risk bringing class \\\\nactions, as I am well aware. There are many barriers to \\\\nbringing them. Article 3 standing provisions have kept many \\\\npeople from pursuing their claims.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. If there is an inappropriate denial that \\\\neffectively causes malpractice who is on the hook, and the \\\\ninsurance companies essentially made the decision, what \\\\nresponsibility for the malpractice does the insurance company \\\\nhave?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. It really does not because the Supreme Court \\\\nsaid that ERISA pays for benefits. If they deny you the right \\\\nto a benefit, you still have the right to get the health care. \\\\nYou just have to pay for it yourself, which is effectively \\\\ndenying the health care. When insurers for example, do not \\\\nhandle claims properly they should be liable for the \\\\nconsequences of not doing so.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin [presiding]. The gentleman&#x27;s time is expired.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Thank you.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. I now recognize Ms. Chavez-DeRemer from the \\\\nState of Oregon.\\\\n    Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding \\\\nthis important hearing on employer provided health plans. Thank \\\\nyou to the witnesses for being here. Roughly, 48 percent of \\\\nOregonians get their health care from their employer. In a lot \\\\nof those plans Oregonians have trouble getting past medically \\\\ninappropriate step therapy protocols.\\\\n    It has been found that step therapy was applied to almost \\\\n40 percent of all specialty drug decisions in the largest \\\\ncommercial plans, and that many step therapy protocols went \\\\nagainst clinical guidelines. Not surprising, since the people \\\\nimposing step therapy are not doctors, all at the expense of \\\\npeople&#x27;s health.\\\\n    As a business owner myself, I know this is not the fault of \\\\nemployers, especially the small business folks. Pharmacy \\\\nbenefit managers, PBMs, are responsible for processing \\\\nprescription drug claims, and they are implementing step \\\\ntherapy without any flexibility for any individual&#x27;s patient \\\\nmedical history or needs.\\\\n    That is why I joined Representatives Wenstrup and McBath in \\\\nintroducing the Safe Step Act, and I hope this Committee can \\\\nadvance it this Congress. Mr. DuBose, the Safe Step Act does \\\\nnot end PBM use of step therapy, it simply establishes a timely \\\\nexceptions process. Do you think that is a fair balance between \\\\nfinding savings without causing harm to the patients?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. We support the Safe Step Act. We do reserve the \\\\nright to use step therapy. I think what is important for plan \\\\nsponsors, especially small businesses, what they need to really \\\\nensure in their plan design for pharmacies, is to make sure \\\\nthat they have independent analysis carved out for their \\\\nauthorizations for those specialty drugs.\\\\n    As you mentioned, as those specialists, the doctors and the \\\\npharmacists, as they confer to decide is it appropriate care, \\\\nbecause ultimately that is the purpose is what is the most \\\\nappropriate care of the right product at the right price at the \\\\nright time? By doing so, you provide the best medicine for that \\\\npatient to reach the best desired outcome possible.\\\\n    Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. At the right cost. We also know that \\\\nmisaligned incentives of the current payment system leave PBMs \\\\nto favor medicines with high list prices, and larger rebates. \\\\nThat is why I am also proud to co-lead the Drug Act, which \\\\nwould crack down on PBMs who put the bottom line ahead of their \\\\nclients and patients&#x27; interests.\\\\n    As PBMs have faced exposure over their practices, they have \\\\nactually shifted their compensation models to focus on \\\\nadministrative and other fees, and those fees have typically \\\\nremained tied to the list prices. Even in cases where health \\\\nplans may be receiving a substantial portion of rebates for \\\\nPBMs, PBMs may still have an incentive to favor those higher \\\\nlist prices.\\\\n    This compensation model is causing patients to face insane \\\\nprices for their prescription drugs, and for what reason? I \\\\nmean really PBMs can manipulate the market while Oregonians \\\\nhave to choose between going hungry and buying their medicine. \\\\nIt is really quite shameful what we are seeing across the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    Dr. Behrens, I want to make sure I get that right, thank \\\\nyou. Do you agree the Drug Act would help address these issues, \\\\nand help bring down costs for employers and patients?\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. First of all, I need to clarify I am not a \\\\ndoctor.\\\\n    Ms. Chavez DeRemer. Oh, I had it wrong.\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. Just a Juris Doctor. Just a lawyer.\\\\n    Ms. Chavez DeRemer. That is okay. Take the credit where the \\\\ncredit is due.\\\\n    Mr. Behrens. I have not specifically reviewed the \\\\nlegislation. I would be happy to and followup more with it. I \\\\ndo think one of the challenges--one of the fundamental \\\\nchallenges here is the list prices and some of the prices that \\\\nare charged to begin with, and a lot of the programs that are \\\\nutilized, tools that are utilized are to deal with those high \\\\nprices.\\\\n    I appreciate the opportunity to look into that more and \\\\nfollowup.\\\\n    Ms. Chavez DeRemer. Yes. If you could followup, review it \\\\nand get back with me that would be great. PBMs should not tie \\\\ntheir compensation, in my opinion, to the price of medicine. \\\\nThat runs counter to the stated mission of lowering drug costs. \\\\nBreaking a link between medicine list prices, rebates and PBM \\\\ncompensation will go a long way in removing the incentives that \\\\npad the PBMs pockets.\\\\n    Madam Chairwoman, these are critical to lowering costs for \\\\npatients and improving transparency for employers throughout \\\\nour districts. I do hope we can move through this process as \\\\nthis Congress wraps up, and with that, I yield back my time.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. I now recognize Ranking Member \\\\nDeSaulnier for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Very good. Your high school French \\\\nsucceeded. Well, thank you again to all the witnesses. The \\\\nERISA Advisory Council just released a report for people who \\\\nare on permanent disability, long-term disability benefits \\\\nabout behavioral health needs.\\\\n    The council found that 99 percent of long-term disability \\\\nplans imposed duration limits for people with disabilities \\\\narising from their behavioral health conditions while not \\\\nplacing similar limitations on disability arising from physical \\\\nhealth conditions. Ms. Handorf, could you briefly discuss how \\\\nthis fact squares with the concept of mental health parity?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. I do not think it is consistent with the \\\\nconcept of mental health parity because I think, with mental \\\\nhealth parity, Congress recognized that mental health \\\\nconditions are just as serious as physical health conditions, \\\\nso you should have parity. People should be treated equally. I \\\\nthink that is a public policy that has been well established. \\\\nIt really makes no sense for disability plans to have different \\\\nstandards for mental health disability and physical health \\\\ndisability They should be the same because the impact is \\\\nexactly the same.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Exactly. Just this past week the New York \\\\nTimes did a frontpage story examining a company called \\\\nMultiPlan, a private equity backed data and analytics firm that \\\\nworks with third party administrators of ERISA health plans. \\\\nThe practice is described as shocking, shortchanging health \\\\ncare providers, and leaving patients on the hook, often with \\\\nbills amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\\\\n    Anecdotally, I have heard from friends of mine and \\\\nproviders, long-term primary care providers, just talking about \\\\nhow much time they are spending on challenges to what used to \\\\nbe normally provided by health care plans, and it is just a \\\\nwaste of that in the system.\\\\n    Ms. Handorf, how did this company in particular make its \\\\nmoney, and who ends up bearing the cost of the savings it \\\\nachieves when patients are the ones who are billed for the \\\\ndifference?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. I think it is still a secret exactly who bears \\\\nthe cost. I think that most plans do not even realize there is \\\\na savings fee attached to the payment. We have seen cases where \\\\na provider is paid $1,500.00 and there is a $30,000.00 savings \\\\nfees attached to it.\\\\n    It goes to the plan as the benefit payment of $31,500.00. \\\\nWhat is not clear is whether the patient, the employee, has to \\\\npay a higher coinsurance because of that, but we do know from \\\\nthe New York Times article that the providers will then bill \\\\nthe patient, and the patient is then obligated to pay more.\\\\n    I think this is probably, I have seen this a lot in plans. \\\\nThey are usually described as savings fees for catching fraud \\\\nand abuse. In fact, they are fees for just bullying a provider \\\\ninto taking a lesser payment.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Just again, anecdotally hearing from \\\\nfriends who have been doctors for a long time. Here in the D.C. \\\\narea, and in my district in the San Francisco Bay Area, about \\\\ncalling me and saying everything has changed. We have been \\\\nproviding the same kind of advice, with the same kind of \\\\nfinancial support for years.\\\\n    Here is an example, with not just the direct costs that are \\\\nlost to the person who is impacted by this, the person who is \\\\nseeking advice in health care, but also the doctors and primary \\\\ncare doctors who don&#x27;t have the kind of staff but have the kind \\\\nof trust and relationship with their patients. It is a real, \\\\nreal, problem. I thought it was fascinating what the New York \\\\nTimes did with it.\\\\n    It seems like for efficiency, we should be able to do \\\\nsomething in a bipartisan level for employers, and for the \\\\npatients. The General Accounting Office recently noted that the \\\\nEmployee Benefits Security Agency at DOL has been almost flat-\\\\nfunded for over a decade, even as its responsibilities have \\\\ngrown enormously during the time due to legislation like the \\\\nAffordable Care Act.\\\\n    This has been a strategy by some of my Republican \\\\ncolleagues do not provide the funding to actually regulate what \\\\nthe law says. Ms. Handorf, do you have any comments?\\\\n    Ms. Handorf. Well, I worked for the Department of Labor for \\\\nmany years, and it is a big task. I think that without the \\\\nfunding you are putting a band aid on enforcement. You need a \\\\nlot of money to investigate some of the insurers. They are not \\\\ngoing to want to give you the information that you need.\\\\n    The problem is that not only does the Department not have \\\\nthe resources to do it, but employees do not have the ability \\\\nto do it for themselves, so it is really important that the \\\\nDepartment have money.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, and I would like unanimous \\\\nconsent to submit to the record a letter that Mr. Scott and I \\\\nhave sent to the Department of Labor, and also a letter from \\\\nSunLife. Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Without objection.\\\\n    [The Information of Mr. DeSaulnier follows:]\\\\n    \\\\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] \\\\n    \\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. Thank \\\\nyou for testifying before us today. We are grateful for your \\\\ntime. I have had the chance to speak with individuals and \\\\nstakeholders on literally every side of this PBM reform issue, \\\\nand I am hopeful that there are some policies we can agree on \\\\nto increase transparency and oversight with respect to PBMs, \\\\nand to reduce costs and address the concerns that I have been \\\\nhearing from constituents and pharmacists alike.\\\\n    One such complaint is that there are three PBMs at this \\\\ntime that control the vast majority of prescription claims for \\\\nthe United States. In fact, their combined market share has \\\\nskyrocketed from 48 percent in 2010 to 80 percent in 2022. \\\\nWhile the PBM industry says there is a lot of competition in \\\\nthe PBM marketplace, I worry that self-insured employers \\\\nactually do not have much choice.\\\\n    I continue to hear from my community and independent \\\\npharmacies, frustration about the lack of meaningful action in \\\\nCongress to reign in PBMs, and I agree. I was a proud supporter \\\\nof the Lower Cost More Transparency Act, which overwhelmingly \\\\npassed the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis last \\\\nDecember, including some of my own language on the Hidden Fees \\\\nDisclosure Act.\\\\n    As it sits in the Senate, unmoved. Mr. DuBose, you stated \\\\nin your testimony that the recent increase in State laws \\\\nseeking to regulate PBMs is caused in part by the vacuum \\\\ncreated by lack of action in Washington on PBM abuses at the \\\\nFederal level, and again I agree. As I continue to have these \\\\nconversations and continue researching on this matter, I would \\\\ncertainly appreciate you sharing your expertise.\\\\n    Mr. DuBose, how do you think Congress can help ensure more \\\\ncompetition in the PBM market, so employers do have real \\\\nchoices?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Yes. I agree the big three have taken over the \\\\nmarket share within self-insured space. They do that because \\\\nmost employers subscribe to the rebate model that is in place. \\\\nThose big three PBMs, they own the aggregators, in which \\\\nrebates flow through from the manufacturers. So they own the \\\\npipeline.\\\\n    For employers, plan sponsors, they have to get educated, \\\\nand they have to identify and find high performing transparent \\\\nPBMs. I believe the key is they have to connect with PBMs that \\\\nare willing to serve as fiduciaries, until the law is changed, \\\\nand which decrees states that PBMs are fiduciaries.\\\\n    That is who they need to seek because then the plan design \\\\nwill move away to an administrative fee model, to where it \\\\nbecomes transparent and the PBM is working with you to protect \\\\nthe interest of the plan members.\\\\n    Then we both seek to find the lowest net cost solution, and \\\\nto move away from an older paradigm that only enriches those \\\\nbig three companies.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Is vertical integration an issue?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Yes. Actually, I believe it is the bigger issue \\\\nfrom spread pricing. Delinking is very important as well \\\\nbecause it drives that vertical integration where they own the \\\\npharmacies, especially mail order, so they are essentially \\\\nselling to themselves. When you do that, the spread pricing is \\\\nreally not that important.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Should pharmacies and insurance companies be \\\\nable to own PBMs?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Yes. In a free market if a pharmacy wishes to \\\\nown a PBM, I do not--I am not opposed to that, but I do believe \\\\nthat PBMs should be a fiduciary, and they should understand \\\\nthat obligation.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Should they be able to mandate that it is \\\\ntheir PBM that must be used, or should be?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Absolutely not.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Should they be required to note only be \\\\ntransparent, but be subject to oversight and accountability?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. How would having some uniform standards in \\\\nplace for PBMs help drug pricing and just the overall \\\\nmarketplace in general?\\\\n    Mr. DuBose. The standards are incredibly important because \\\\nthat is where the employers, those plan sponsors, fall down. If \\\\nyou do not have transparency, you cannot see the data, it is so \\\\nopaque you cannot craft the policy, which means you cannot \\\\ncraft good plan design. Then that is where the plan suffers and \\\\nfails to meet the needs of the plan members.\\\\n    I believe transparency has to come first, and then with \\\\nthose prohibitions on those practices, then the right pathways \\\\nalign.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. I appreciate your knowledge on the \\\\ntopic. I hope that this Congress we will continue to consider \\\\nhow we can address it, and improve not only drug prices and \\\\ncost transparency, but the overall marketplace. I yield back my \\\\ntime.\\\\n    I would now like to recognize the Ranking Member for a \\\\nclosing statement. Mr. DeSaulnier, you are now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you. I want to thank the Chair and \\\\nthe Committee, and the witnesses as well for your testimony. \\\\nThanks for spending your time with us. Fifty years ago, \\\\nCongress took action and passed the Employee Retirement Income \\\\nSecurities Act, or ERISA, to protect the interest of millions \\\\nof workers and their families who receive retirement benefits \\\\nand health care through their employer.\\\\n    As I noted at the beginning of this hearing, it is critical \\\\nto understand the significance of job-based coverage here in \\\\nthe United States. Over 164 million workers and their families \\\\nbenefit from health care coverage they receive through their \\\\njobs. However, time and an ever-evolving workforce and the \\\\nhealth care industry have revealed that ERISA has failed to \\\\nlive up to its promise for millions of Americans.\\\\n    Significant gaps in health care coverage and exorbitant \\\\ncosts for hospitals, physicians, and lifesaving prescription \\\\nmedications continue to squeeze workers out of their last \\\\ndollar. Loopholes continue to allow large, unscrupulous \\\\ninsurers to engage in practices that raise costs for both \\\\nworkers and their employers.\\\\n    Democrats have worked tirelessly to strengthen ERISA, \\\\npromote access to care, and lower health care prices, but there \\\\nis still room for improvement, only if consumer protections \\\\nremain in place, and become more efficient. I look forward to \\\\nworking with the majority to see if we can find a common \\\\ninterest to accomplish this.\\\\n    I welcome and hope for earnest engagement with Republican \\\\ncolleagues so we can fully support employers and workers and \\\\ncontinue to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle \\\\nout. I yield back.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. I now recognize myself for closing \\\\nremarks. On behalf of the 153 million Americans whose health \\\\ncare benefits rely on ERISA, I think we have certainly learned \\\\na lot today about how we can improve the law. It is clear to me \\\\nthere are areas where government should get out of the way, \\\\nlike streamlining paperwork requirements.\\\\n    ERISA was created to reduce the regulatory burden that \\\\nwould arise from complying with various State laws. We should \\\\nnot replace regulatory relief with more regulation. In other \\\\nareas, clarity is needed. I am particularly interested in how \\\\nincreased transparency will provide employers, and ultimately \\\\npatients, with cost information for health care services.\\\\n    In the age of technology, it is time we move past these \\\\nunknown and unexplained high health care costs. Employers and \\\\npatients both deserve to know the price of care. Congress \\\\nshould protect the ERISA preemption, so that multi-State \\\\nemployers can continue to easily offer benefits across State \\\\nlines.\\\\n    Protecting this provision will preserve the private health \\\\ninsurance system and shield American from devolving into a \\\\nsingle payer system. Thank you certainly to our witnesses for \\\\nyour time, and for your insightful testimony.

Darin LaHood \\\\n[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. The subcommittee will come to order, and I \\\\nam Congressman Darin LaHood, the chair of the Work and Welfare \\\\nSubcommittee. And I want to welcome everybody to this Work and \\\\nWelfare Subcommittee hearing today in the city of Chicago. And \\\\nwe are so proud to have the members of the Ways and Means \\\\nCommittee here today for this important hearing.\\\\n    Before we begin, let me just acknowledge Pastor Phil and \\\\nthe folks here at Pacific Garden Mission for the work they have \\\\ndone to make this hearing come about. Let&#x27;s give them a round \\\\nof applause. [Applause.]\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. A lot of work went into putting this \\\\ntogether, and so we are thrilled to have a wonderful venue to \\\\nhave our hearing today. And it is not often that we get 10 \\\\nMembers of Congress outside of Washington, D.C. to come out to \\\\nChicago, but today&#x27;s field hearing is reflective of that, in a \\\\nbipartisan way, to have members of the Ways and Means Committee \\\\nhere, and specifically the Work and Welfare Subcommittee.\\\\n    I also want to acknowledge Congressman Danny Davis. We are \\\\nin his district here. Yes----\\\\n    [Applause.]\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD [continuing]. And for him to welcome us \\\\nhere. I am proud to represent the 16th district of Illinois, \\\\nwhich is a little south and west of here. My home is Peoria. I \\\\nalso represent Bloomington-Normal and the city of Rockford, and \\\\nthen I extend out into DeKalb County, McHenry County, and \\\\nGrundy County. And so it is an honor and a privilege to \\\\nrepresent the constituents of the 16th district and to be here \\\\ntoday for this important hearing.\\\\n    So we, Congressman Davis and I, work on the Work and \\\\nWelfare Subcommittee, which has responsibility of overseeing \\\\nseveral important Federal anti-poverty programs that provide \\\\nassistance to vulnerable children and families. And we are very \\\\nlucky, obviously, to be here today at Pacific Garden Mission, \\\\nand to see the work here to uplift and restore the lives of \\\\nhomeless individuals and families here in Chicago.\\\\n    Yesterday we had the opportunity to visit Project HOOD and \\\\nPastor Corey Brooks. We did a field--a site hearing, or a site \\\\nvisit yesterday at in Englewood, and we learned about the \\\\nimportant work that Pastor Brooks and his team are doing to \\\\nuplift and transform lives in Englewood and Woodlawn, including \\\\nbuilding a new community center there.\\\\n    One of the things that has stood out to me about both of \\\\nthese organizations is their philosophy of uplifting and \\\\nequipping individuals in crisis with skills and tools to find \\\\nstability and transform their lives through faith and work.\\\\n    How we define ``help&#x27;&#x27; matters. Whether it is through \\\\nchurches, non-profits, private foundations, or government \\\\nprograms, when providing relief and assistance to those in need \\\\nwe should be exploring every possibility to promote work as a--\\\\nas the surest pathway out of poverty. No amount of handouts or \\\\ngovernment assistance, no matter how well intentioned, can \\\\nsubstitute for the intangible benefits and dignity that work \\\\nbrings to individuals and their families, and the ripple effect \\\\nit has on our communities.\\\\n    All of our government programs need to be oriented to \\\\nprovide every opportunity for individuals to grow their \\\\ncapacity and be connected to meaningful work. At the most \\\\nfundamental level, work provides income and greatly reduces the \\\\nlikelihood of being in poverty. Simply working even part-time \\\\ndramatically reduces the chances of living below the poverty \\\\nline.\\\\n    In 2021 the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that \\\\nonly 4.1 of individuals who worked part-time over a period of \\\\nat least 27 weeks had incomes below the poverty line, and only \\\\n2.6 of those who worked full-time.\\\\n    Beyond providing a reliable source of income, work also \\\\nprovides countless intangible benefits to individuals. Research \\\\nhas shown that work is associated with improved physical and \\\\nmental health, social well-being, and higher degrees of human \\\\nconnectedness and social capital. Conversely, studies have \\\\nlinked joblessness with increased social isolation, depression, \\\\nanxiety, and feelings of hopelessness. Joblessness can even \\\\naffect physical health. One study found that unemployment \\\\nlasting longer than six months can reduce life expectancy by as \\\\nmuch as a year-and-a-half for a 40-year-old worker.\\\\n    Tying Federal benefits to the expectation of work is not \\\\npunishment. Work in exchange for benefits represents society&#x27;s \\\\ncommitment to helping individuals and families in crisis. In \\\\nfact, most Americans support work as a condition of welfare. A \\\\n2023 Axios poll found nearly two-thirds of Americans, including \\\\nhalf of Democrats, support work requirements for welfare \\\\nprograms.\\\\n    As part of this committee&#x27;s ongoing efforts to restore work \\\\nrequirements to Federal programs in 2023, we secured a major \\\\nvictory by strengthening work requirements for families \\\\nreceiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, known as \\\\nTANF, cash assistance as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. \\\\nThe bipartisan law closed loopholes to hold states accountable \\\\nfor engaging TANF work-eligible individuals in work, and \\\\nestablished pilot programs to measure recipient employment and \\\\nearnings outcomes to test alternative measures of performance.\\\\n    But more can be done. Conducting these field hearings, like \\\\nwe are doing today, gives us an opportunity to hear directly \\\\nfrom people who have overcome the odds to escape poverty, and \\\\nthe organization and leaders that do the hard work every day to \\\\nhelp individuals transform their lives. And we will hear from \\\\nsome of those remarkable individuals today as our witnesses.\\\\n    I want to again thank our witnesses for being here today, \\\\nand for the Pacific Garden Mission, and I look forward to the \\\\ntestimony we will hear.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. With that I am pleased now to recognize \\\\nMr. Davis, our ranking member, for his opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank you \\\\nfor holding this field hearing. I am delighted to welcome all \\\\nof you to my home city of Chicago. There was a time when we \\\\nwould say it has Wrigley Field, Soldier Field, Marshall Field, \\\\nand it sits by a lake of some size. But I am pleased to be here \\\\nwith all of you at the Pacific Garden Mission, and to have \\\\nvisited Project HOOD yesterday. Both organizations serve people \\\\nin need so well.\\\\n    Democrats and President Biden have put helping workers \\\\novercome barriers to sustainable, quality employment at the \\\\nheart of our policies. Even in this time of economic growth, \\\\nwhere wages have risen and unemployment has been cut in half, \\\\ntoo many people are left out not because they prefer needing \\\\ngovernment help, but because they face significant barriers to \\\\nquality employment. Some don&#x27;t have childcare or need paid \\\\nleave to deal with an illness or care for an elderly parent. \\\\nSome lack the skills or education needed for good jobs. Some \\\\nhave jobs, but don&#x27;t earn enough to make ends meet, like the \\\\n6.4 million working poor. Some made mistakes in the past and \\\\ncan&#x27;t get a second chance.\\\\n    I am proud that Democrats provided emergency aid to \\\\npreserve childcare centers and permanently increased Federal \\\\nchild care investment by over 600 million a year, about 20 \\\\nmillion of it right here in Illinois.\\\\n    I am proud that Democrats expanded the child tax credit \\\\nthat slashed child poverty to just 5.2 percent in Illinois. \\\\nUnfortunately, that poverty cut in child tax credit expired due \\\\nto Republican inaction, and child poverty is back up to 12.4 \\\\npercent, an unacceptable outcome.\\\\n    If our goal is to support work to help people escape \\\\npoverty, then people don&#x27;t need more penalties, requirements, \\\\nand paperwork. Parents need guaranteed childcare and paid \\\\nfamily and medical leave that we know substantially increase \\\\nworkforce participation among women. People need a safe place \\\\nto live, food to eat, reliable transportation, good education, \\\\nand health care to sustain the stability needed to work \\\\nsuccessfully.\\\\n    I strongly disagree with those that blame people for their \\\\npoverty and suggest that the solution is low or no-wage jobs \\\\nwith work requirements to make sure they don&#x27;t develop a \\\\ndependency mentality. Denying people food, housing, enough \\\\nmoney to pay the rent, and making them work for free doesn&#x27;t \\\\ngive them dignity.\\\\n    I am proud to showcase the work done at the Safer \\\\nFoundation to overcome the systemic barriers faced by justice-\\\\ninvolved individuals so they can get good jobs and turn their \\\\nlives around. I worked with Safer to set up an amazing program \\\\nto help people with records obtain careers in health care. The \\\\nprogram involves intensive training coupled with legal \\\\nservices, support services, technical assistance for \\\\nbusinesses, and job placement services. Over three years the \\\\ninitiative placed 113 clients with 71 employers and achieved a \\\\n93 percent retention rate over 2 years. Our subcommittee should \\\\nsupport programs like Safer that methodically address the \\\\nmultiple barriers struggling workers face.\\\\n    As we sit in the Mission I am reminded of 2017, when the \\\\nRepublican Congress enacted a bill to tax faith-based \\\\norganizations on the value of their parking and benefits \\\\nprovided to employees to pay for tax cuts for wealthy \\\\nindividuals and corporations. I heard a lot from faith-based \\\\norganizations in Illinois about the church parking tax. \\\\nDemocrats repealed this tax in 2019, but the wealthy who \\\\nbenefitted from those tax breaks will soon ask Congress to \\\\nextend their tax cuts. My hope is that my Republican colleagues \\\\nwill protect the programs that help people live with dignity, \\\\nand not make them subsidize tax cuts for the wealthy again.\\\\n    As a Black American who grew up in the segregated South and \\\\nwho came to Chicago for the opportunities that were not as \\\\navailable in the South, I know firsthand how systemic barriers \\\\nlimit opportunities. It has been my honor to devote my \\\\ncongressional career to work, like we do in this subcommittee, \\\\nto help those who are struggling to overcome systemic barriers \\\\nwith the education, jobs, child care, paid family and medical \\\\nleave, and other supports so that they can thrive.\\\\n    I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to \\\\ntalk about our work and thank you very much.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Davis. It is now----\\\\n    [Applause.]\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. It is now my pleasure to introduce the \\\\nchairman of the full Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Smith of \\\\nMissouri.\\\\n    And when Mr. Smith took over as our leader on the \\\\ncommittee, he talked about doing a number of field hearings. \\\\nAnd I think this is our ninth or tenth field hearing that we \\\\nhave done over the last year-and-a-half, getting out across \\\\nAmerica to hear from individuals on what we can do better in \\\\nWashington, D.C. And so it wasn&#x27;t just rhetoric; it is the \\\\nreality that we are doing these field hearings.\\\\n    And so, with that, it is my pleasure to introduce our \\\\nchairman, Mr. Smith of Missouri.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Chairman LaHood and Ranking \\\\nMember Davis.\\\\n    It is not often that a subcommittee is led by the chair and \\\\nthe ranking member from the same state, and so I am glad we \\\\ncould visit Illinois to hear from folks that you both \\\\nrepresent. So thanks for the hospitality of hosting us, Ranking \\\\nMember Davis.\\\\n    I also want to thank Pastor Phil. Thank you all so much, \\\\nand your entire team here at Pacific Garden Mission for hosting \\\\nour committee.\\\\n    Today we are----\\\\n    [Applause.]\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Today we are actually making history. This \\\\nis the first time in congressional history that a standing \\\\nHouse committee has held a hearing in a homeless shelter. Way \\\\noverdue. [Applause.]\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Pacific Garden Mission is the oldest faith-\\\\nbased homeless shelter in the country, providing help to men \\\\nand women across Chicago since 1877. The work you do is \\\\ncritically important to helping those in need transform their \\\\nlives. Most importantly, what you do here is about not giving \\\\nup on people. That is why we are having the hearing today. We \\\\nare in Chicago to listen to the real stories of individuals \\\\nwhose lives were transformed by work, and what it takes to \\\\nshepherd those in crisis from poverty to independence.\\\\n    Taxpayers fund a fragmented and often confusing safety net \\\\nsystem that spans more than 80 different Federal programs at a \\\\ncost of more than $1 trillion every year. These programs \\\\nprovide important food, housing, health care, and cash \\\\nassistance to help those in poverty. However, as Federal \\\\nsupport has grown, programs have largely failed to focus on how \\\\nto help lift people back into full self-sufficiency. Instead, \\\\nsuccess is measured by how many new people are added to the \\\\nrolls of these programs.\\\\n    This approach discourages people from seeking a path to \\\\nwork. As a result, more people are receiving welfare benefits \\\\ntoday than at any time in our nation&#x27;s history. In 2023, 85 \\\\nmillion people were enrolled in Medicaid, an increase of 20 \\\\npercent since 2019. This represents 25 percent of the U.S. \\\\npopulation. One-fourth of the U.S. population is on Medicaid. \\\\nIn 2023, 41 million people received food assistance through \\\\nSNAP, an increase of 18 percent since 2019. This represents 12 \\\\npercent of the entire population.\\\\n    What we have lost sight of is that a job is the best anti-\\\\npoverty program that exists. Work is more than a paycheck. \\\\nEvery person has skills and abilities they can offer to their \\\\ncommunity. Often it is just connecting those skills with the \\\\nright job. When people are not able to apply their talents, \\\\nthey miss out on the dignity that comes from work, and their \\\\ncommunities are denied their contributions.\\\\n    Relying on a government check can weaken an individual&#x27;s \\\\nability to use and grow their skills. Instead of climbing out \\\\nof poverty, families find themselves without hope and trapped \\\\nwith fewer options for their future. Children with parents who \\\\nare unable to find meaningful employment often struggle in \\\\nschool, and they face more severe mental health issues, \\\\ncontributing to a generational cycle of poverty. In fact, one \\\\nin every three children who grow up in poverty will raise their \\\\nown children in poverty.\\\\n    We must break the cycle. Clearly, the path from welfare to \\\\nwork is not easy or straightforward. Folks often must first \\\\novercome the barriers that contribute to poverty, like mental \\\\nhealth or educational challenges, substance abuse, health \\\\nproblems, neglect. Too often, however, community leaders find \\\\nthemselves battling against so-called solutions from Washington \\\\nthat make it harder for individuals to escape poverty.\\\\n    We know as much from recent history. Under the American \\\\nRescue Plan Act, the child tax credit was transformed from a \\\\nprogram that rewards work to one that does not, and Democrats \\\\nextended unemployment benefits that paid people more not to \\\\nwork. As a consequence, a government check was worth more than \\\\na paycheck, and millions of families sat on the sidelines. It \\\\nis not the fault of those families; they were just responding \\\\nto the incentives of Washington, which they provided.\\\\n    There is more that we can and we should do. Last year, as \\\\npart of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, Republicans led changes \\\\nto strengthen work requirements and the Temporary Assistance \\\\nfor Needy Families and supplemental nutrition assistance \\\\nprograms. Last month Republican members on our committee \\\\nintroduced legislation that would protect taxpayer dollars \\\\nprovided through TANF from being lost to waste, fraud, and \\\\nabuse.\\\\n    We are here because we want to hear from those on the front \\\\nlines of this crisis. There will be clipboards that our team--\\\\nwill be passed out for anyone in the audience to share any \\\\nconcerns or ideas. We will enter those into the official record \\\\nand take them back with us to Washington as we consider how \\\\npolicies can better connect people to work and lift more \\\\nAmericans out of poverty.\\\\n    Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to your \\\\ntestimony.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. And thank you, Chairman LaHood.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Chairman Smith, for that.\\\\n    It is now my pleasure to introduce our witnesses here \\\\ntoday. We have six of them, and we will start off with Mr. Matt \\\\nPaprocki, who is the president and CEO of the Illinois Policy \\\\nInstitute. He is also the CEO of the Center for Poverty \\\\nSolutions, and a real thought leader here in Chicago.\\\\n    Next we will hear from Nathan Montgomery, who is the \\\\nexecutive director of Salt and Light in Urbana, Illinois.\\\\n    Our next witness will be Brian Butler, who is from my \\\\nhometown of Peoria, Illinois, and is the director of \\\\nresidential ministries at Pathway in Peoria.\\\\n    And then next we will hear from Kristy Schofield, also from \\\\nPeoria, and is the director of homelessness and housing at the \\\\nDream Center in Peoria, Illinois.\\\\n    Next we will hear from Gianno Caldwell, who is the founder \\\\nof Caldwell Strategic Consulting in Washington, D.C., but a \\\\nnative of Chicago, and proud of his Chicago heritage.\\\\n    And lastly we will hear from Sodiqa Williams, who is the \\\\nvice--senior vice president of the Safer Foundation here in \\\\nChicago.\\\\n    You will all be recognized for five minutes.\\\\n    And we will begin with you, Mr. Paprocki.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF MATT PAPROCKI, PRESIDENT AND CEO, ILLINOIS POLICY \\\\n                           INSTITUTE\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. Thank you, Chairman Smith, Chairman LaHood, \\\\nand Ranking Member Davis, and the distinguished members of this \\\\ncommittee. My name is Matt Paprocki. I am the founder of the \\\\nCenter for Poverty Solutions, a project created from the \\\\nIllinois Policy Institute, where I serve as president and CEO. \\\\nToday in my testimony I want to demonstrate why work is the \\\\nbest pathway out of poverty and to give people dignity. And I \\\\nwant to end by giving three solutions that this committee can \\\\ndo to enact that.\\\\n    But first, let me give you some background. The Center for \\\\nPoverty Solutions was created to look at the research behind \\\\nwhat are the biggest drivers to eradicate poverty. And we work \\\\nwith direct service agencies, partner together, and we pass \\\\nbipartisan legislation to reduce poverty and increase \\\\nopportunities. Our goal is to eliminate poverty starting here, \\\\nin the City of Chicago.\\\\n    And I have good news. We have one single factor that can \\\\nreduce poverty by 87 percent. It is work. In fact, those people \\\\nwho are working a full-time job, only 2 percent of them are \\\\ncurrently in poverty.\\\\n    Take, for example, my friend Steven Blake. Steven was a \\\\nhomeless veteran, but thanks to this place here, Pacific Garden \\\\nMission, he was given shelter and job training. Today Steven is \\\\nan entrepreneur who sells fresh fruits to commuters on their \\\\nway to work. Two months ago I walked by Steven on this cold, \\\\nfreezing day. It is raining outside, and I saw Steven there. I \\\\nsaid, ``Steven, what are you doing out here today?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    And Steven points to a man a few feet away from us, and he \\\\nis holding a sign, and the cardboard sign says, please help. \\\\nAnd he said, ``Matt, that used to be me.&#x27;&#x27; He said, ``I stood \\\\nout here every single day, and every person who walked by, I \\\\nwould ask them, How can you help me?&#x27;&#x27; He said, ``Today I do \\\\nthe opposite. Every single person who walks by I say, How can I \\\\nhelp you?&#x27;&#x27; A huge smile comes across his face. He said, \\\\n``Matt, I got to be out here. People need me.&#x27;&#x27; That is \\\\ndignity. That is a dignity that is enshrined in our \\\\nConstitution in the phrase ``in the pursuit of happiness.&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nThat is a dignity that lifts people closer to the image and the \\\\nlikeness of God. That is a dignity that lifts people out of \\\\nmental illness, out of abuse, and out of dependency.\\\\n    Quite frankly, this is what is missing in our society \\\\ntoday, a society which often tells people you can&#x27;t do it. \\\\nBecause poverty today is less about food and housing and \\\\nsecurity, and it is becoming more about hopelessness, \\\\nindependence. Meaningful work can solve all of these problems. \\\\nI know because I have lived it.\\\\n    When I was 24 years old I was a professional staffer, and I \\\\ngot a call from my mom. She said, ``Matt, I am at the hospital, \\\\nand I have just been diagnosed with cancer.&#x27;&#x27; So I left the job \\\\nthat I loved because my mom needed me. And for the next eight \\\\nmonths I stayed at home with her. And one cold December day she \\\\ndied in my arms and I lost my purpose. I had no job. I had no \\\\nmoney. I had no parents. Nobody needed me. For the next few \\\\nmonths I qualified for just about every welfare benefit there \\\\nwas, and I thank God that I never took them. Because for too \\\\nmany Americans, welfare is not a temporary safety net; it is a \\\\nsnare net. And generations get stuck inside of this. In fact, a \\\\nPew study shows that 70 percent of people who are currently on \\\\ngovernment assistance will never escape, and that extends to \\\\ntheir children and their grandchildren.\\\\n    My escape from poverty was the same as Steven&#x27;s and \\\\nmillions of others. We found a job. More importantly, we found \\\\ndignity in work. And from there we built our families, we \\\\nbecame more active in our community. We volunteered. We can \\\\nhelp millions of Americans, lift them up out of poverty, and \\\\nbring them closer to that dignity of work. And this committee \\\\nhere can do three things to help drive that home.\\\\n    The first is stop the benefits cliff. Right now we have \\\\ncreated this impossible structure, where families are forced \\\\nwith the decision of either cut back on their hours or don&#x27;t \\\\ntake a promotion or receive additional government funding. We \\\\nare stopping that, and we need to change the benefits cliff.\\\\n    The second is expand tax credits for apprenticeships. The \\\\naverage apprenticeship starting salary is $77,000 a year.\\\\n    And finally, institute work requirements similar to the \\\\nsuccessful bipartisan reform that was passed in 1996 which \\\\nlifted millions of people out of poverty.\\\\n    Today I ask all of you to create a better America, an \\\\nAmerica which tells all people, ``We need you,&#x27;&#x27; an America \\\\nthat creates limitless opportunities, an America that allows \\\\nall people to pursue happiness. And that pursuit begins with \\\\nthe dignity of work.\\\\n    Thank you, Chairman LaHood. Thank you, Chairman Smith, \\\\nRanking Member Davis, and all the members of this committee for \\\\nthe opportunity to testify today.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Paprocki follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Paprocki. We will next \\\\nrecognize Mr. Montgomery.\\\\n\\\\n STATEMENT OF NATHAN MONTGOMERY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SALT AND \\\\n                             LIGHT\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. MONTGOMERY. Good morning, Chairman Smith, Subcommittee \\\\nChairman LaHood, Ranking Member Davis, and distinguished \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee. I want to thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to testify here today on the dignity of work.\\\\n    I am the co-founder and executive director of Salt and \\\\nLight, located in Champaign, Urbana, Illinois. The Salt and \\\\nLight opened its doors in January 2004, with a focus on sharing \\\\nthe good news of the gospel by helping those in need through a \\\\nfood pantry and clothing closet. Very quickly, we grew into the \\\\nlargest emergency food program in our area and a leader for \\\\nproviding access to basic resources.\\\\n    As Salt and Light&#x27;s reach and influence expanded, I grew \\\\ndisillusioned with what we were doing. Most of the situations I \\\\nencountered never seemed to change, and the lines only got \\\\nlonger. I had even begun seeing young adults standing in line \\\\nwho, as children, stood in line with their parents. The \\\\ngenerational cycle of poverty was playing out right before my \\\\neyes. I began asking myself, were we contributing to it?\\\\n    It was at this time I was introduced to the book, ``When \\\\nHelping Hurts,&#x27;&#x27; our small staff and board began a journey of \\\\nwrestling with what it had to say and what it might mean for us \\\\nto embrace its ideologies. As 2013 ended, I presented the board \\\\nwith a vision for what change might look like.\\\\n    As we moved forward we acknowledged how much we still \\\\ndidn&#x27;t know, and how important it was to be willing to listen \\\\nand learn along the way. The primary guiding principle during \\\\nthis time was we knew we had to stop doing for and start doing \\\\nwith. We recognized that by doing for individuals what they \\\\ncould or had the potential to do for themselves, we caused \\\\nharm.\\\\n    The result is a unique and innovative approach for \\\\naddressing chronic food insecurity and access to other basic \\\\nresources, where individuals can acquire what their family \\\\nneeds, learn practical job skills, and generate revenue to fund \\\\nthe programing at the same time. In our model participants earn \\\\nstore credit at minimum wage by volunteering at either of our \\\\nlocations for up to a maximum of four hours each week. This \\\\ncredit can be used to purchase groceries, clothing, or other \\\\nhousehold items.\\\\n    Both of our locations operate a retail storefront offering \\\\nsecond-hand items, and our Urbana location has a grocery \\\\ndepartment comparable to an Aldi in the number and types of \\\\nitems that it carries. Inventory is purchased from a variety of \\\\nvendors, just like any other independent grocery store. Both \\\\nstores are open to the public and are staffed by regular, full \\\\nand part-time employees and volunteers, with participants \\\\nworking alongside. Accepted forms of payment include cash, \\\\ncredit and debit cards, participant store credit. Urbana also \\\\naccepts SNAP and WIC for qualifying grocery items. One hundred \\\\npercent of the net proceeds from the stores support the store \\\\ncredit participants earn, and the other programs and services \\\\nwe offer.\\\\n    The last year of the old model, we had a budget of just \\\\nunder $370,000 that was 100 percent funded through donations. \\\\nTransitioning to a retail storefront with all the programmatic \\\\nchanges meant an increase in staffing to 14 employees, and an \\\\nalmost 200 percent increase to the budget. But because of the \\\\nrevenues generated by the retail operations, we only needed to \\\\nraise six percent more in donations than we had previously. \\\\nThis year our operating budget is 3.6 million, and is about 85 \\\\npercent self-funded through our retail operations, with the \\\\nremaining 15 percent coming from donations. We have 51 \\\\nemployees and 150 participant households who are earning store \\\\ncredit.\\\\n    I do not believe simply ensuring work requirements are \\\\nfulfilled and loopholes are closed for TANF will provide the \\\\nkind of transformation desired. I do believe, however, not \\\\ndoing so is a disservice to the people we seek to help. \\\\nReasonable and appropriate expectations based on the capacity \\\\nof the individual is not punitive or onerous. It is loving and \\\\naffirming.\\\\n    It has been said people rise or fall to the level of the \\\\nexpectations you have for them. To have no expectations is to \\\\ncommunicate you do not believe they have anything to offer, \\\\nanything to contribute, not only in their situation but to the \\\\ncommunity they are a part of. I can think of nothing more \\\\ndiminishing and disempowering to the very spirit, the very \\\\ndignity of a person.\\\\n    Regardless of the changes made to TANF, however, I have \\\\nlittle faith any widespread transformation will occur in the \\\\nlives of those struggling in poverty if the states are the \\\\nadministrators of this or any other welfare program. The one-\\\\nsize-fits-all approach most state and Federal programs take do \\\\nnot allow for the kind of flexibility needed to effectively \\\\nwork with families whose situations and obstacles vary from one \\\\nneighbor to the next, let alone from one end of the state to \\\\nthe other. From the Federal perspective, I can understand where \\\\nadministration through the states may be more efficient, but \\\\nclearly it has been programmatically ineffective.\\\\n    It is time we stop doing what is easy and start doing what \\\\nis right.\\\\n    Thank you, Chairman Smith, Subcommittee Chairman LaHood, \\\\nRanking Member Davis, and members of the committee for the \\\\nopportunity to testify here today.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Montgomery follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Montgomery. I next \\\\nrecognize Mr. Butler.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF BRIAN BUTLER, DIRECTOR OF RESIDENTIAL MINISTRIES, \\\\n                       PATHWAY MINISTRIES\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. BUTLER. Thank you, Chairman LaHood, Chairman Smith, and \\\\nRanking Member Mr. Davis, and the rest of the distinguished \\\\ncommittee for having us here today.\\\\n    I will give you a little history of Pathway Ministries. We \\\\nwere founded in 1955 after 2 ladies visited right here at the \\\\nPacific Garden Mission. They came back to Peoria and started \\\\nserving coffee and donuts and sharing the gospel of Christ with \\\\nmen who were experiencing homelessness.\\\\n    The ministry now operates across 7 different facilities, \\\\nserving nearly 2,000 individuals each year. We average more \\\\nthan 160 men and women staying in our facilities every night. \\\\nIn 2023 we served more than 100,000 meals, provided over 50,000 \\\\nnights of shelter, and graduated 151 men and women from our \\\\nresidential programs. Those programs include varying aspects of \\\\neducation, counseling, life skills, and work readiness \\\\ntraining.\\\\n    Our Pathway Works provides critical job readiness \\\\nopportunities for our students within commercial enterprises, \\\\nand our ministries of Empower Life and Barnabas Counseling \\\\nserve our community by offering life-affirming assistance, \\\\nparenting classes, and clinical counseling.\\\\n    Our mission is to create pathways out of poverty through \\\\nJesus with our neighbors in need. That mission begins with the \\\\ndifferent view of poverty than most. We don&#x27;t view poverty as \\\\nsimply a lack of material things or even housing. We believe \\\\npoverty is more complex, and is the result of brokenness in the \\\\nfour fundamental relationships of life: our relationship with \\\\nGod, with ourselves, with others, and with creation or our \\\\nwork.\\\\n    We believe that Jesus came to restore not just our \\\\nrelationship with God, but to renew all four of these \\\\nrelationships. And we all need renewal because at some level we \\\\nare all poor. Poverty will look different for each of us, and \\\\nmost of the men and women we serve are experiencing devastating \\\\neffects from their brokenness in one or more of these \\\\nrelationships. They not only seek to seek shelter, but a \\\\npathway to stability. And one of the most important aspects of \\\\nthat path will be the dignity and sustainability that work \\\\nprovides.\\\\n    I have personally experienced the value of this approach, \\\\nas my own pathway out of poverty includes a lifestyle of drug \\\\naddiction and alcoholism, trying to be a gangster, and \\\\neventually prison. But Jesus restored and renewed my \\\\nrelationships with Himself, with myself, with others, and with \\\\nmy ability to work. We believe this pathway begins with \\\\ncompassionate crisis care, meeting people where they are at \\\\nwith love and support, and that path includes two programs or \\\\navenues our guests can choose from.\\\\n    Our Next Step program focuses primarily on vocation. Our \\\\nadvisors assist guests as they learn to take their next step \\\\ntowards spiritual freedom, personal responsibility, and self-\\\\nsufficiency.\\\\n    The Second Avenue is our renewal program, which is a \\\\nresidential recovery-based program. This opportunity is nine \\\\nmonths long, is Jesus-centered, and allows students time to dig \\\\ndeep and focus on repairing those relationships I just spoke \\\\nabout.\\\\n    All of our programing, from crisis care to renewal, has \\\\nsome form of work included. It might be just getting up in the \\\\nmorning and making your bed, doing daily chores, or \\\\nparticipating in our job readiness training programs.\\\\n    Finally, we also offer our students who graduate from our \\\\nprograms the option of joining our graduate society, where they \\\\ncan live up to three years in an affordable and accountable \\\\nenvironment.\\\\n    In regards to our work readiness classes and on-the-job \\\\ntraining, we focus on the skills everyone needs to be \\\\nsuccessful. We have partnered with Caterpillar for over 25 \\\\nyears, recycling their wood waste and teaching students those \\\\nvarious skills. We also partner with other work readiness \\\\nprograms such as Illinois Central College&#x27;s Workforce \\\\nCertification Program to support students in finding work that \\\\nthey love.\\\\n    One of our students, TJ, just completed the ICC&#x27;s truck \\\\ndriver training program, and now drives for PepsiCo, and makes \\\\na really good wage. Erica also graduated from ICC, and she is \\\\nnow employed as a second-year carpenter, helping to install one \\\\nof the largest solar fields in Illinois. And more importantly, \\\\nErica has been reunited with her five-year-old son, Michael. \\\\nBoth of these former students are now living on their own, \\\\nearning living-wage incomes, and have a renewed sense of \\\\npurpose and dignity. And there are many more like TJ and Erica, \\\\nbecause in the past four years we have helped more than 600 men \\\\nand women find jobs, and we have assisted more than 400 men and \\\\nwomen in securing permanent housing.\\\\n    We have learned that when people grasp the dignity of work \\\\nand the value of providing for themselves financially, they are \\\\nempowered to live lives that bring life to the Peoria \\\\ncommunity. These folks are moving from costing our community to \\\\ncontributing to our community. We are putting people to work \\\\nwho pay taxes and spend their money in Peoria. We are adding \\\\nmembers to local churches. We are able to experience with our \\\\nstudents that joy when they get their first paycheck. We see \\\\nthe freedom that comes from people paying off debt when they \\\\nthought they never could.\\\\n    But the most rewarding time comes when we are able to see \\\\nthe power of God in our students to see themselves correctly, \\\\nand to live with the dignity that comes from work. It is not an \\\\neasy path, but by working on those four fundamental \\\\nrelationships with Christ we see Him not only bring eternal \\\\nlife, but a renewed life now. We watch Him provide that pathway \\\\nout of poverty.\\\\n    Thanks again, Chairmen Smith, LaHood, and Ranking Member \\\\nDavis, and the rest of you. God bless you.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Butler follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Butler. I now recognize Ms. \\\\nSchofield.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF KRISTY SCHOFIELD, DIRECTOR OF HOMELESSNESS AND \\\\n                  HOUSING, DREAM CENTER PEORIA\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. SCHOFIELD. Good morning, Chairman Smith, Chairman \\\\nLaHood, and Ranking Member Davis, members of the committee. My \\\\nname is Kristy Schofield, and I am director of homeless and \\\\nhousing for the Dream Center Peoria. But 27 years ago I was a \\\\nhomeless mother, sleeping in my car with my four-year-old son \\\\nand my three-year-old daughter. I had run from a marriage \\\\nfilled with domestic violence and was suffering from a \\\\ndepression so deep, so dark I was not functional as a person or \\\\na parent.\\\\n    I know the pain of having your children hungry but having \\\\nnothing to give them, having them cry because they are scared \\\\nand not being able to make them feel safe. But God had a bigger \\\\npurpose with this, and I found the very shelter and housing \\\\nprograms that I now direct, and I got what I needed to become \\\\nself-sustaining. And I was so grateful that I have spent the \\\\nlast 25 years working with these programs as the director.\\\\n    The work that I do, the accomplishments have given back the \\\\nself-esteem that I lost through the homelessness. At the Dream \\\\nCenter Peoria, women, children, and families are receiving \\\\nlife-changing services, and I am so blessed to work for an \\\\norganization that gives our guests the second chance of life, \\\\nand works so hard to help them become self-sustaining. I am \\\\nalso so honored to be able to give those the gift that I was \\\\ngiven.\\\\n    At DCP I see so many broken and homeless. Even though they \\\\nbecome homeless for a myriad of reasons--unemployment, \\\\nunderemployment, substance abuse, mental health--the common \\\\nthread in so many cases is the lack of self-esteem and self \\\\nbelief in what they can achieve. That self-esteem and belief \\\\ncan be rebuilt through accomplishment and achievement.\\\\n    We partner with programs such as workforce development, \\\\nIllinois Central College adult education, and more. We offer \\\\ntrades program on site for those interested in culinary, auto, \\\\nsmall engine repair, screen printing, coding, and a complete \\\\ncoffee program that allows students to learn the coffee world \\\\nfrom roasting the beans, packaging, marketing, and sales.\\\\n    These programs give our guests an opportunity to work and, \\\\nwith that, accomplish and achieve, thereby gaining that self-\\\\nesteem and belief in themselves and lowering the chance that \\\\nthey will live in poverty.\\\\n    We also partner with the Department of Children and Family \\\\nServices, our programs being an opportunity to keep families \\\\ntogether, which is the goal, to bring safety and stability to \\\\nthe household.\\\\n    One family in our program is a single mother household, \\\\nlost her children to DCFS a little over a year-and-a-half ago. \\\\nShe had been unsuccessful at managing employment due to \\\\nsubstance abuse issues, and her children were placed in foster \\\\ncare. She began counseling, treatment, and a workforce \\\\ninitiative we partner with. She has secured full-time \\\\nemployment, and has even worked her way into shift management. \\\\nThese achievements have given her a greater sense of belief in \\\\nherself, and she is on the path to return of her children \\\\nwithin the next three months.\\\\n    It is our belief that work builds self-esteem, provides \\\\nfamilies that have struggled to sustain a better chance at \\\\nlong-term success.\\\\n    So many years of working in these programs have given me a \\\\nsense of accomplishment, pride, and self worth. I know \\\\nfirsthand the difference work and becoming self-sustaining \\\\nmakes in someone&#x27;s lives. You see, 27 years ago, when I was in \\\\nmy car with my kids, I lowered my pride and I called my ex to \\\\nbeg for help. And he said to me, ``I told you when you left \\\\nthat you would have nothing.&#x27;&#x27; Well, 27 years later, a lot of \\\\nhard work, myself, my children, and now my grandchildren, we \\\\nhave everything.\\\\n    Chairman Smith, Chairman LaHood, and Ranking Member Davis, \\\\nmembers of the committee, thank you so much for the opportunity \\\\nto share my story, my life as well, and all that the Dream \\\\nCenter Peoria does for our area&#x27;s most vulnerable.\\\\n    [The statement of Ms. Schofield follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Ms. Schofield. We will now \\\\nrecognize Mr. Caldwell.\\\\n\\\\n   STATEMENT OF GIANNO CALDWELL, FOUNDER, CALDWELL STRATEGIC \\\\n                           CONSULTING\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. CALDWELL. Good morning, Chairman LaHood, Chairman \\\\nSmith, Ranking Member Davis, and all the members of the \\\\ncommittee. Thank you, Chairman, for giving me the time to speak \\\\nbefore your committee regarding both my professional experience \\\\nand personal experience growing up within the welfare system.\\\\n    I grew up on the South Side of Chicago. During that time, \\\\nfor many years, my mother was addicted to crack cocaine, and \\\\nour family only endured via government housing and welfare. But \\\\na government check can only do so much.\\\\n    In my experience, there are two kinds of people who get on \\\\ngovernment assistance. The first is those who really don&#x27;t have \\\\na choice. They see government assistance as a temporary measure \\\\nto help them get through a rough patch to get back on their \\\\nfeet, which is how the system was originally created. But in \\\\nthe last 50 years it has become a way of life for many \\\\nAmericans, a permanent solution. And the promise of the so-\\\\ncalled Great Society became a trap for millions of Americans. \\\\nIn many cases, those who get on government assistance too often \\\\nget comfortable and figure out how to manipulate the system as \\\\nmuch as possible so they can continue on the same pathway going \\\\nforward. I have seen such thinking take down even the strongest \\\\nof people.\\\\n    For years my grandmother was our family&#x27;s saving grace. She \\\\nwould visit us in our apartment in a government housing project \\\\non the South Side, where drugs and gangs were in every hallway, \\\\nand she would come in with bags of groceries and shoes that she \\\\nbought us from Payless Shoe Store. She tried to take care of us \\\\nfrom afar, but eventually she had seen enough, and my siblings \\\\nand I moved in with her.\\\\n    She was a no-nonsense woman of faith and industry. Nana, as \\\\nwe called her, worked 10 hours a day as a private duty nurse, \\\\nand we were doing okay for a while until our Nana&#x27;s car was \\\\nstruck by a habitual drunk driver. And this woman, who worked \\\\nhard her entire life, could no longer do her job. Her back \\\\nbrought agony with every step. She tried to work a reduced \\\\nschedule, and was now doing overnight shifts, harder on her \\\\nlife and well-being, but easier on her body. But then she \\\\ncouldn&#x27;t even do that anymore.\\\\n    The government checks began to arrive again. Not for my mom \\\\nanymore, but for my grandmother. When you get into this \\\\ndependency mentality, it changes everything. Your focus can \\\\nchange. Your thoughts too quickly becomes how can I get more, \\\\nmore housing, more food stamps, more cash from the government. \\\\nMy grandmother&#x27;s desire to work the system all too quickly took \\\\non a life of its own. People in my community would come around \\\\nand say, ``Listen, these are the kinds of things that I have \\\\nbeen pulling off to get more of this or more of that,&#x27;&#x27; and my \\\\ngrandmother would lean into it.\\\\n    One can completely lose their pride as they try to figure \\\\nout how to survive by working the system. Even more tragically, \\\\nyou begin to pass down these tactics to your family and those \\\\naround you.\\\\n    I got into public service volunteering for my local \\\\nalderman at 14, and my first job working part-time for the \\\\nSocial Security Administration by 16. But there were times in \\\\nmy teens I was told not to work because it could jeopardize the \\\\ngovernment assistance our family was receiving. Even then, the \\\\nidea was both astonishing and horrifying to me.\\\\n    But I don&#x27;t necessarily blame my grandmother for that. \\\\nPoverty and government dependance don&#x27;t just affect your bank \\\\naccount. Eventually, it begins to affect your mind. You see \\\\nnothing but what is in front of you. And when what is in front \\\\nof you is a politician with another handout, watch out. How \\\\nmany Americans have accepted the narrative that only government \\\\nhandouts are the answer to all that ails? Too many.\\\\n    More often than not, the people around me weren&#x27;t simply \\\\ndeciding to give up, they were living in a culture of \\\\ndependency that they passed down from birth. Both my \\\\ngrandmother and my mother gave in to that culture, and they \\\\nexpected me to figure out the best way to live on that same \\\\ntrack, for in neighborhoods like the one I grew up in there is \\\\nno perceived incentive to advance. After all, the checks for \\\\nhousing and food stamps and other assistance arrive every \\\\nmonth.\\\\n    This is why the system must be reformed. Welfare should \\\\nonly exist for a certain period of time, unless you are totally \\\\ndisabled and can&#x27;t physically work. It should not last for a \\\\ngeneration. The government should instead provide more \\\\nincentives for real-world training and education to recipients \\\\nabout a life beyond government dependance.\\\\n    I believe reforms to welfare should be approached with the \\\\nsame bipartisan spirit that Speaker Newt Gingrich and President \\\\nBill Clinton had during the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, a \\\\nbipartisan compromise, an overhaul that significantly changed \\\\nour nation&#x27;s welfare system to require work in exchange for \\\\ntime-limited assistance and supports. Its official name was the \\\\nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \\\\nAct.\\\\n    Personal responsibility. It has been almost 20 years since \\\\nwe revisited and recommitted to this idea. Many will point to \\\\ninstitutional racism or generations of poverty that have been--\\\\nthat have made it tougher for many, particularly Blacks in the \\\\ninner cities, to succeed. Truthfully, racism has had an impact \\\\non many people. However, citing racism as the sole reason for a \\\\nlack of success is merely another trap meant to keep \\\\nunderprivileged people dependent. People have to want the power \\\\nthat comes with personal responsibility. But first they need to \\\\neven know such capability and power exist.\\\\n    There is not one government handout that can pour into you \\\\nthe desire to better your own life. As Ronald Reagan once \\\\nwarned, we should measure welfare success by how many people \\\\nleave welfare, not by how many are added. He understood, as I \\\\ndo from firsthand experience, that those trapped within \\\\ngovernment assistance will eventually devalue their own lives, \\\\nso much so that life itself would take on little meaning. Thus, \\\\nthe shootings and teenagers ready to murder without hesitation \\\\nas easily as grabbing a bite to eat.\\\\n    Morally, throwing more money at the problem is clearly not \\\\nthe answer. Until we have the courage to articulate and address \\\\nthe issues of personal responsibility, or better parenting, \\\\nschooling, accountability, then whatever welfare we pander will \\\\nonly make things worse. There is no doubt that our cities are \\\\ncrying out for help, as my family did many years ago. But we \\\\nanswer that--by how we answer that cry will determine the level \\\\nof dependency or success for future millions of Americans. \\\\nThank you.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Caldwell follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD.

Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Smith, \\\\nChairman LaHood, and Ranking Member Davis, and all the members \\\\nof the committee. My name is Sodiqa Williams, and I am senior \\\\nvice president of reentry services for the Safer Foundation.\\\\n    Thank you for providing this time and space to give \\\\ntestimony. It is especially appropriate, given April is Second \\\\nChance Month, the time when Congress and our nation raise \\\\nawareness about the successes and challenges faced by formerly \\\\nincarcerated individuals in our society. During Second Chance \\\\nMonth, we promote policies, programs, and opportunities that \\\\nsupport rehabilitation and reintegration for the one in three \\\\nAmericans who carry the lifetime burden of an arrest and \\\\nconviction record.\\\\n    The Safer Foundation was launched in 1972 by two men of the \\\\ncloth, Bernie Curran and Gus Wilhelmy, to provide non-sectarian \\\\nmentoring and workforce development services to people \\\\nreturning to the community from jail and prison. For 52 years \\\\nSafer Foundation has provided a full spectrum of reentry, \\\\nworkforce development, and rehabilitation services for men and \\\\nwomen, youth and adults in Iowa and Illinois. Today we are a \\\\nnational leader in supporting the efforts of people with arrest \\\\nand conviction records to become employed and productive \\\\nmembers of the community.\\\\n    Since 1972 our work has expanded to include academic and \\\\nvocational career education, community corrections, and \\\\neducation services inside of Cook County Jail, the nation&#x27;s \\\\nlargest single-site detention center. More recently, Safer has \\\\nbeen the lead agency in the Innovative Supportive Reentry \\\\nNetwork Collaborative. This is a holistic, comprehensive \\\\nreentry navigation model providing stable housing, substance \\\\nuse and mental health treatment, physical health care services, \\\\njob readiness, documentation assistance, and job placement \\\\nservices.\\\\n    I want to speak a few moments to the issue of high-quality, \\\\nliving-wage work. People with arrest and conviction records \\\\nneed high-quality living-wage employment opportunities to \\\\ndefeat recidivism. Several years ago, Safer partnered with \\\\nJPMorgan Chase on the JPMorgan Second Chance Hiring pilot. That \\\\nprogram connected individuals with arrest and conviction \\\\nrecords to substantive living-wage careers in the financial \\\\nservices sector, where demand for skilled labor is high.\\\\n    Research suggests that post-prison, high-quality, higher-\\\\nwage employment results in fewer arrests or returns to prison \\\\nwhen compared to low-wage, low-job-quality employment. The \\\\npilot&#x27;s success was demonstrated by JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s increase \\\\nin the hiring of people with arrest and conviction records, and \\\\ncontributed to the launch of the Second Chance Business \\\\nCoalition, highlighting a broader shift towards inclusive \\\\nemployment practices within the financial industry.\\\\n    High-quality, living-wage work is pro-social and improves \\\\nself-esteem, and is a positive use of time. Knowing your work \\\\nwill provide for your way of life makes a difference that gives \\\\nyou self-esteem and confidence.\\\\n    High-quality, living-wage work through reentry is critical \\\\nto the success of the nation&#x27;s economy. People with arrest and \\\\nconviction records are one of the largest untapped pools of \\\\nlabor available to U.S. businesses. The current demand for \\\\nqualified workers is high and, according to the National \\\\nFederation of Independent Businesses, many unemployed \\\\nindividuals do not meet the qualifications for industries that \\\\nare hiring. Fifty-five percent of business owners reported \\\\nhiring or trying to hire. Eighty-nine percent of those hiring \\\\nor trying to hire reported few or no qualified applicants for \\\\navailable positions.\\\\n    What can Congress do? We urge the Congress to fund $135 \\\\nmillion for the Reentry Employment Opportunities, RIO, program \\\\nat the Department of Labor&#x27;s Employment and Training \\\\nAdministration, which provides workforce development and \\\\nreentry services to people with criminal legal histories, while \\\\nhelping employers identify trained and credentialed employees \\\\nto hire for their open positions.\\\\n    We urge the Congress to fund $125 million for the Second \\\\nChance Act program at the Department of Justice, Bureau of \\\\nJustice Assistance to provide reentry services and supports \\\\nnationwide.\\\\n    Finally, we urge that Congress create new legislation that \\\\nremoves the more than 44,000 state and Federal legal collateral \\\\nconsequences creating lifetime barriers that impede the social \\\\ndevelopment of individuals and their families from the pursuit \\\\nof life, liberty, and happiness.\\\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify. When we make \\\\nnominal investments in people&#x27;s efforts to secure private-\\\\nsector employment through reentry, the beneficiaries include \\\\nall of us: taxpayers, government, families, and communities. \\\\nThank you.\\\\n    [The statement of Ms. Williams follows:]\\\\n   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Ms. Williams. I want to thank \\\\nall of our witnesses for your valuable and substantive \\\\ntestimony here today. We are now going to move to our question-\\\\nand-answer period from the Members of Congress. We will begin \\\\nwith Chairman Smith.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you. I thank each and every one of \\\\nyou for your testimony.\\\\n    Mr. Caldwell, your story is one of victory over adversity. \\\\nYour experience surely has taught you valuable lessons about \\\\nwhat does help individuals escape poverty, including the value \\\\nof work and the positive ripple effects it can have in our \\\\ncommunities.\\\\n    That being said, could you share some insight into what \\\\npolicies, in your view, create a direct impediment in lifting \\\\nmore Americans out of poverty?\\\\n    Mr. CALDWELL. Yes, there is a number of things that I think \\\\nthat block that. And I have got to tell you, with the Welfare \\\\nReform Act of 1996, which I thought was incredibly important \\\\nbecause it did allow for individuals--like myself, for example, \\\\nI worked for the Social Security Administration. I only could \\\\nget that part-time job based on experience and the fact that I \\\\nwas receiving--when my family was receiving benefits at the \\\\ntime. That was a gate that opened wide open for many, many \\\\nAmericans, I think.\\\\n    Now, the truth of the matter is, for those who want to \\\\nreform the system, which is a good thing, those who want to say \\\\nif you earn, you know, a particular dollar amount, we are going \\\\nto pull the rug from under you and we are going to ensure that \\\\nthe door closes right behind you, I think that is where the \\\\nproblem comes for a lot of folks in communities like the South \\\\nSide of Chicago. They want to certainly know that there is \\\\ncertainty in the fact that they can go out and work and earn as \\\\nmuch as they possibly can, and then gradually come off the \\\\nsystem. And I think that, in and of itself, is an opportunity \\\\nfor those who may be a little fearful of going out there. That \\\\ngives them a bit of peace to try to get that dignity of work \\\\nand lift out of poverty.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. I noticed that when you were giving your \\\\ntestimony, you had, it looked like, maybe not hit all the \\\\npoints that you want. Is there anything additional that you \\\\nwould like to share?\\\\n    Mr. CALDWELL. No. You know, I think for many of us it has \\\\nbecome the boogeyman that you say someone has to work to earn \\\\nbenefits or, rather, to be able to have benefits. I think that \\\\nis a boogeyman. I think it is wrong.\\\\n    I think, for a lot of individuals, they want to work. The \\\\npeople in the communities that I grew up in, they wanted to \\\\nwork. They didn&#x27;t know the processes in some ways, and then \\\\nsome others just would rather stay at home. But when you stay \\\\nhome, things like depression happen. You have domestic abuse \\\\nthat could happen. And then there is criminality that can come \\\\nright after, nefarious activities to try to earn money and \\\\ncontinue to receive your welfare at the same time. And I think \\\\nthose are some of the issues that need to be closely looked at.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Montgomery, I appreciate the unique approach that your \\\\norganization takes in providing the assistance through real-\\\\nworld experiences that empower individuals and demonstrate the \\\\nimportance of work and independence. Based on your experience \\\\nand the transformation you have seen in those you have \\\\nassisted, how might state and Federal-level welfare programs do \\\\nmore to provide that sense of empowerment to folks?\\\\n    Mr. MONTGOMERY. Yes, thank you. Good question. Thank you, \\\\nChairman Smith.\\\\n    You know, I think that one thing that I have heard \\\\nmentioned is the benefit cliff. Certainly, I think that is a \\\\nhuge obstacle for a lot of folks in trying to move forward. I \\\\ndon&#x27;t know how many different people I have spoken with who \\\\nreached that point of decision where, okay, now if I am going \\\\nto move forward, my benefits are going to be cut, but the wages \\\\nI am going to earn are not going to make up the difference. So \\\\nnow I can either choose to retreat or I can choose to \\\\npersevere.\\\\n    And the reality of it is, especially when you have grown up \\\\nin a generational cycle of poverty, where all you have known \\\\nand been conditioned to is the idea of standing in line, the \\\\nability to see down the road is almost impossible. And so I \\\\nthink that certainly is a huge part of really being able to \\\\nimplement programs that work with folks, because at the end of \\\\nthe day the people have to have the autonomy and capacity to \\\\nmake those decisions to really move forward as a part of that.\\\\n    That is--the bottom line for us is we acknowledge that all \\\\nof us are broken, and we want to walk alongside one another as \\\\nwe all grow into who it is we have been created to be. But we \\\\nhave to create space and opportunity for that to happen over \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Thank you all for being here.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Smith. We will now yield to \\\\nMr. Davis for his questions.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to all of \\\\nthe witnesses.\\\\n    I certainly would agree that work is one of the best \\\\nprograms that could exist to reduce poverty. As a matter of \\\\nfact, I am reminded that in ``The Prophet,&#x27;&#x27; Gibran said that \\\\nwhen you work, it is love made visible; that when you work, it \\\\nbinds you to your dreams, hopes, and aspirations.\\\\n    Vice President Williams, let me thank you for spending time \\\\nwith us. And I know that Safer has refined its programs over \\\\ntime, and that often times you have had to adjust and readjust. \\\\nCan you talk a bit about what supports you have found necessary \\\\nto help your clients overcome barriers to long-term work, \\\\nproductive work that they enjoy and can feel good about?\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. Thank you, Ranking Member Davis.\\\\n    We have been--and our mission remains the same when it \\\\ncomes to providing work for the individuals we serve. But over \\\\ntime we realized that people want to work, but they have so \\\\nmany barriers in between them and that job. And they could be \\\\ncollateral consequences, so statutory, legal barriers that \\\\nstand before them--and I have to tell you, I have done a lot of \\\\nwork in advocacy, and it is like ripping off layers to an onion \\\\nin terms of how many barriers exist in front of them.\\\\n    But also it is the supports they need from--they need \\\\nwraparound services. So over time we have had to become a \\\\nwraparound holistic service shop, a one-stop-shop because they \\\\nneed housing, they need transportation in order to get to work. \\\\nThey have to have education in order to have skills for certain \\\\ntraining so that they can get that living-wage employment.\\\\n    They--when they are stabilized, when they do receive \\\\nhousing, when they can go to a job, then they can start opening \\\\nup about other issues that impact their life, including if they \\\\nhave any kind of substance use or mental health needs, \\\\nbehavioral health needs that we can treat.\\\\n    And now, now we are at a point where we can start talking \\\\nto them about their health, because we had to start to \\\\nstabilize them to get to them to a point of thriving to talk \\\\nabout their health. And so I am very honored that now we have \\\\nthe opportunity to talk about how can we improve your health so \\\\nthat you can go to job--to your job, so that you can not only \\\\nget it but maintain it?\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. I know that you have had great success in the \\\\nhealth arena. Could you talk a little bit about how that came \\\\nabout and who you worked with?\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. Well, we worked with you, and many, many \\\\nthanks that we could make that happen, because if it had not \\\\nbeen for you to call the forum with health care employers, I \\\\ndon&#x27;t know if we would have been able to do the work.\\\\n    We had to have a formal--we invited health care employers, \\\\nincluding FQHCs and hospital systems and all the chairmen and \\\\nall the CEOs, and they came because of your help. And they gave \\\\nus an audience to listen. We had Johns Hopkins Hospital come \\\\nand talk about their program, hiring people with records, where \\\\nthey had been hiring people with records for over a decade and \\\\nhad very low turnover, high retention. And they had close to no \\\\nlevels of, like, violent incidents that happened when they \\\\nhired people with records. The Chicago area employers heard it. \\\\nAnd by the end of that pilot, we had health care employers \\\\nknocking at our door: ``We need to hire everybody. We need to \\\\nhire, you know, we have frontline, we have nursing, we have all \\\\nthese positions available.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    But what we found in that forum is that employers had this \\\\nperception that they couldn&#x27;t, per the law, hire people with \\\\nrecords, and they didn&#x27;t know how. So they had a whole process, \\\\nbackground check policies that were outdated. They hadn&#x27;t \\\\nlooked at the recent law. They didn&#x27;t have them updated, they \\\\ndidn&#x27;t know how to hire. And then there was the implicit bias \\\\nthat was attached as well, not for the executive leadership \\\\nthat came to the forum, but from their hiring managers who, if \\\\nthey were informed that a person had a record, they would not \\\\nhire that person.\\\\n    So we had to navigate through all of those barriers, and we \\\\nhad to change the law, as well. We led occupational licensing \\\\nreform. I see Matt from the Illinois Policy Institute there. We \\\\nworked with the Illinois Policy Institute, and we created a \\\\nbipartisan coalition to pass occupational licensing reform. The \\\\nhealth care work is the reason why we did that, because we knew \\\\nif we wanted people to get into health care, we had to knock \\\\ndown those barriers and ensure that it was a fair process for \\\\nthem to have a fair chance.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Davis. I will now recognize \\\\nmyself for a number of questions.\\\\n    I first want to just point out today we have about seven \\\\nmillion unfilled jobs in the country. And everywhere that I \\\\ntravel in my district--and I think probably my colleagues feel \\\\nthe same way--it is finding qualified workers: truck drivers, \\\\nnurses, mechanics, machinists. Throughout our society we are \\\\nlooking for a qualified workforce. And there is, again, no \\\\nbetter topic than we are talking about today in transitioning \\\\npeople into the workforce to get a number of these good-paying \\\\njobs through apprenticeships, skills training, and workforce \\\\ndevelopment.\\\\n    Mr. Paprocki, I want to start with you. We have heard a lot \\\\ntoday about the bipartisan nature of going back to 1996, when \\\\nSpeaker Newt Gingrich and President Clinton worked together on \\\\nbipartisan welfare reform and the benefits. As a result of \\\\nthose reforms, under TANF, the Temporary Assistance of Needy \\\\nFamilies, caseloads dropped by 80 percent between 1994 and \\\\n2023. Over time, these successes, though, have been chipped \\\\naway by policies at the state level that cut or eliminate work \\\\nrequirements under the guise of compassion. While \\\\ncharacterizing these efforts to link welfare benefits, some \\\\npeople have called that mean or unfair.\\\\n    I am wondering if you could comment on linking welfare \\\\nbenefits to the expectation of work as being mean or unfair in \\\\nsome way. And instead of reducing these requirements, do you \\\\nthink it would be good to expand them to other Federal means-\\\\ntested programs?\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. You know what I think is mean? How we treat \\\\npoor people in this country. We treat them like they are \\\\nliabilities and they are not assets, right?\\\\n    They are raising their hand and they are saying, ``I want \\\\nhelp,&#x27;&#x27; right? But instead we go give them a little bit of \\\\nmoney on a plastic card, and we tell them to go away. That is \\\\nmean. Right?\\\\n    We tell them that their jobs don&#x27;t have purpose, that just \\\\nbecause it is low-wage, meaning it is low-value, and we whisper \\\\nthese little lies inside of it as if dignity is commensurate \\\\nwith pay. It is not, right? Jobs have value. Humans have value. \\\\nPoor people have value, and they are some of the greatest \\\\nassets we have in this country.\\\\n    I think a great example of this is this woman, Claudia \\\\nPerez. She is over in the Pilsen neighborhood. And every \\\\nmorning she gets up and she sells tamales to her neighbors in \\\\nher community. But pushing a food cart was illegal in the City \\\\nof Chicago. So government officials came by, they took her food \\\\ncart, they dumped out all of her food. They stomped it on the \\\\nground, and they said, ``This is garbage.&#x27;&#x27; Right? To me, that \\\\nis mean.\\\\n    And I think we need to restore this idea of all work has \\\\ndignity, and we need to promote this, and we need to shift the \\\\nframework that we have on poor people in this country. Instead \\\\nof treating them like liabilities, we should have work \\\\nrequirements. We should say, ``We know what value that you can \\\\nprovide for this country because we believe in you,&#x27;&#x27; and we \\\\nshould expand more of that and allow more people to see that \\\\ndignity in their work.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Butler, thank you for your testimony. Thank you for \\\\nbeing here, and thanks for sharing your story of success and \\\\nhow you achieved that. You talked about the Pathway \\\\norganization on the success you have had, building the capacity \\\\nand the skill sets for your residents through work so that they \\\\ncan earn higher wages. Can you talk about the specific \\\\npartnerships that you have in Peoria, specifically with \\\\nIllinois Central College and the workforce and certificate \\\\nprograms that they offer?\\\\n    Mr. BUTLER. Yes, sure. So we partner with Illinois Central \\\\nCollege, and we have--first I would like to just say that the \\\\nfolks coming through our door need a moment to breathe and to \\\\nbecome stable. I am sure with Pacific Garden Mission and Dream \\\\nCenter and everywhere else in our community, folks come in and \\\\nthey need a moment to breathe, to be stabilized, and to get \\\\nready.\\\\n    So we use an asset-based approach at Pathway Ministries \\\\nwhen folks come into our doors. What is it that they want to \\\\ndo? And when they have expressed interest to further their \\\\neducation, to further job readiness training, to get out of \\\\nthis cycle of poverty, not to get my SSI check because I can \\\\nmake way more--which is a mindset that just blows me away, that \\\\npeople come in for $735 a month and don&#x27;t want a job making \\\\n$2,000 a month, they are afraid to lose that check, it is an \\\\nanomaly, it is awful to deal with.\\\\n    But we partner with ICC. Our folks are able to get funded \\\\nthrough ICC. That is free to them to go to school. They \\\\nactually will earn a stipend to go to school and learn that \\\\ntrade. It has been absolutely awesome throughout our community, \\\\nas well.\\\\n    Our Pathway Works enterprise programs, we also pay folks a \\\\nstipend as they stay in the shelter or they are in our renewal \\\\nprograms to learn those soft skills, what employers are looking \\\\nfor: being dependable, coming to work with a good attitude, how \\\\nto have conflict resolution so that they can further their \\\\nlives outside of Pathway Ministries.\\\\n    Homelessness is typically just a symptom of the real \\\\nproblem. And when we address homelessness as an individual, \\\\nrather than this great big problem, we can have more success at \\\\nsolving the problem when we do it on an individual level.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you for that.\\\\n    Ms. Schofield, I am going to ask you the same question. I \\\\nalso want to just acknowledge you sharing your story and the \\\\nstruggles you have gone through, and what you have been able to \\\\ndo to better your life, thank you for sharing that here today. \\\\nCan you talk a little bit about the Dream Center and the \\\\nsimilar partnerships you have with workforce agencies and the \\\\ncommunity college?\\\\n    Ms. SCHOFIELD. We would not be able to do what we do with \\\\npeople without the great partnerships in our community. We are \\\\npartnered with Illinois Central College on the same types of \\\\nprograms as Pathway&#x27;s. We are partnered with education with \\\\nseveral trade schools, the apprenticeship program through the \\\\nelectrical. That is what it is, it is the apprenticeship \\\\nprogram. All those programs we partner with because we found \\\\nthat so few people actually want to go back and get a degree; \\\\nthey wanted to get something that they could start working \\\\nright now. And these programs would offer stipends while they \\\\nwere training so they could afford to live and be a part of the \\\\nprogram and learn a new trade.\\\\n    And these people have been very, very successful, and so it \\\\nhas been a great program for us.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you for that. We will next recognize \\\\nMr. Smucker of Pennsylvania for his questions.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate each of \\\\nyou being here to share your stories and share the way you are \\\\nmeeting the needs in your communities. It is really inspiring.\\\\n    And I appreciate the opportunity for us, on a bipartisan \\\\nbasis, to be discussing these. And I think this is most helpful \\\\nwhen we look together at what is working and what is not, and \\\\ndo not have the partisan bickering that I think is not helpful, \\\\nnot helpful at all.\\\\n    I want to start with reconciling a few statements that were \\\\nmade today. And I have got a great deal of respect for Ranking \\\\nMember Davis, but I am going to pick out just one statement he \\\\nmade. He said he strongly disagrees with those who blame people \\\\nfor their poverty. He strongly disagrees with those who blame \\\\npeople for their poverty.\\\\n    Mr. Montgomery, you said people rise or fall to the level \\\\nof expectations you have of them. And Ms. Schofield, you said a \\\\ncommon thread in so many cases is the lack of self-esteem or \\\\nbelief. And I would like to ask--maybe we will start with Mr. \\\\nMontgomery--how do you reconcile the idea--we know individuals \\\\nyou are serving have things stacked against them. They may not \\\\nhave the family support that is needed. They may have \\\\ngenerational poverty. They may not know how--Mr. Caldwell, you \\\\nsaid, to get off of government assistance, how to enter the \\\\nworkforce. They may have been incarcerated. There may be drugs. \\\\nThere are a lot of things. They may have a poor education \\\\nsystem. There are a lot of things stacked against them.\\\\n    But yet we have to expect that they somehow rise to the \\\\nlevel of accepting responsibility for their own path forward. \\\\nAnd so I think, you know, saying we strongly disagree with \\\\nthose who blame people for their poverty may not fully capture \\\\nhow we need to think about this.\\\\n    I heard another member of the Ways and Means Committee at \\\\none of our hearings say a statement that shocked me, and that \\\\nwas that we were holding that hearing that day to dispel the \\\\nnotion--she was glad we were holding the hearing, because it \\\\ndispelled the notion that many members had that work ethic has \\\\nanything to do with success or failure. And so--and this was a \\\\nteacher who talked about the classroom, where students were \\\\ncoming with very--you know, things stacked against them. But I \\\\njust thought what a sad thing, to think that we would be \\\\ntelling people that you can&#x27;t pull yourself up because of the \\\\ncondition you are in.\\\\n    So Mr. Montgomery, how do you balance that? How do you get \\\\nto the point that Mr. Caldwell was talking about, where you can \\\\nchange your own life?\\\\n    Mr. MONTGOMERY. Sure. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    Certainly, poverty is complex, right? We know that there \\\\nare systems at play. We know that there are choices at play. In \\\\nmy experience, everyone&#x27;s situation and position in life boils \\\\ndown to two things: opportunity and choices.\\\\n    The opportunity often--systems are involved in that: where \\\\nI am born, the color of my skin, the type of education I am \\\\nafforded, the opportunities that are in front of me. Right? \\\\nEveryone, it is different.\\\\n    With that we all have choices to make. You know, in my \\\\nexperience, certainly, the less opportunity you have, the less \\\\nmargin you have to make bad choices for sure, no doubt. But it \\\\ndoes not remove the personal responsibility of making choices.\\\\n    And so I think that the idea that it is somehow punitive \\\\nand otherwise blaming the individuals, it is a matter of \\\\nperspective. I think that was something we encountered when we \\\\nfirst changed our model. There were folks who looked at what we \\\\nwere doing--and quite frankly, a few referred to it as the \\\\nRepublican model, which is somewhat fitting today, given the \\\\nconversation. But the reality was we were not changing how we \\\\nwere doing what we were doing in order to punish or blame those \\\\nindividuals. We were changing our model because we believed in \\\\nthem. We believed in their capacity. We believed that they had \\\\nsomething more to offer than what they were experiencing in \\\\nthis poverty situation that they were dealing with on a day-to-\\\\nday basis.\\\\n    And I think it is important how we look at it. Certainly, \\\\nyou can approach it from a punitive perspective and how you \\\\nbasically administer or implement those sorts of things. But \\\\nfor us, that is not how we look at it at all.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. We need, as a society, their energy, their \\\\nwork.\\\\n    Mr. MONTGOMERY. A hundred and ten percent. We talk about \\\\nthat every day, that we are co-laborers. And what that means is \\\\nthat I have as much to gain from you as you do from me in this \\\\nrelationship as we work alongside one another.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. One of the things that strikes me--and I only \\\\nhave a few seconds here--is that most of your programs, you are \\\\ndoing it without any government assistance. And in fact, Mr. \\\\nCaldwell said the government programs we have perhaps make it \\\\nworse.\\\\n    Mr. MONTGOMERY. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. Which is amazing to hear.\\\\n    But one thing we can all agree on, I think everyone here \\\\nand everyone there, is the value of work. So perhaps we ought \\\\nto be thinking about our government programs and investing more \\\\nin that career and technical training.\\\\n    There is a program called WIOA. I have a bill that would \\\\nreenergize that program, incentivize employees [sic] to help \\\\nindividuals get to the workforce. Also, we could potentially be \\\\nproviding a tax credit to employers who invest in \\\\napprenticeship programs, who invest in career and technical \\\\ntraining, having those kind of connections because, as Chairman \\\\nLaHood said, millions of jobs available, yet millions of people \\\\nnot participating in the workforce. And I think we ought to be \\\\nfocusing our efforts on how we can better connect those two \\\\nfacts of life that we have here today.\\\\n    So this was very, very helpful. Sorry I am a little bit \\\\nover time here, Mr. Chairman, but thank you.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Smucker. I now recognize \\\\nMs. Moore of Wisconsin.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, \\\\nMr. Chairman, and Mr. Ranking Member. I want to thank all of \\\\nour witnesses for very profound, insightful testimony.\\\\n    I really appreciate my colleagues for being so candid about \\\\ntheir beliefs. And so I may as well be candid, as well. I do \\\\nthink that when we start talking about blaming people for their \\\\npoverty, I kind of agree with you, Mr. Montgomery. People have \\\\nopportunity and choices, as well. And I thought that was very \\\\nprofound, the way you put it.\\\\n    But I would say that there are economic schemes that \\\\nmaximize profit over people, and that that is what traps people \\\\ninto low-wage work. So when we start hearing about Ms. Williams \\\\nand the type of opportunity she is talking about, and the kind \\\\nof opportunities that my colleagues here often talk about, you \\\\noften want to talk about forcing people to go to work, saying \\\\nthat, you know, you can&#x27;t eat dignity, you can&#x27;t pay your rent \\\\nwith dignity. You need money. You need enough money. And I \\\\nwould think that these low-wage jobs create problems.\\\\n    I agree with you, Mr. Paprocki, that benefit cliffs really \\\\ncontinue to keep people subjected to these low-wage jobs, \\\\nforces them to remain in them if they want to continue to get \\\\nMedicaid and other kinds of support. Welfare deliberately \\\\nlimits the education and training that you can get so that you \\\\ncan never get out of poverty. And of course, poor health is a \\\\nmajor barrier, and mental health.\\\\n    And domestic violence, Ms. Schofield, is a huge risk factor \\\\nfor being poor.\\\\n    Mr. Paprocki, you didn&#x27;t mention what your level of \\\\neducation was at the time your mother was sick, and whether or \\\\nnot you had any children. Would you share that with the \\\\ncommittee?\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. I did not have children. I had a bachelor&#x27;s \\\\ndegree.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. And you have a bachelor&#x27;s degree. \\\\nSo you didn&#x27;t have a lot of barriers. You went to get yourself \\\\ntogether when your mother died. I mean, you were a good White \\\\nman in America with no kids. You didn&#x27;t need childcare. Thank \\\\nyou for that.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. Well, I did----\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. You had a bachelor&#x27;s degree. I \\\\ndon&#x27;t have much time.\\\\n    Mr. Montgomery, I am so happy that you are engaged in \\\\nfinding the root causes of poverty, that you are more data-\\\\ndriven, and you have really demonstrated it by your amazing \\\\ntestimony here today.\\\\n    Mr. Butler, you are a sermon in shoes. I thought you were \\\\ngoing to pass the collection plate there for a minute. You are \\\\na role model. I really love your analysis about building the \\\\nkinds of spiritual and human and cultural relationships. And \\\\nagain, Ms. Schofield, really, your happily ever after wasn&#x27;t. \\\\nBut it turned out happily ever after anyway for you. Domestic \\\\nviolence is a real risk factor for women. You have a baby, and \\\\nyou think things are going to work out, and when they don&#x27;t it \\\\nis the woman who becomes the welfare queen and the problem, and \\\\nnot the man. I appreciate your testimony.\\\\n    Mr. Caldwell, I hope you go and kiss your grandmother 20 \\\\ntimes on her feet everywhere for raising you. Any assistance \\\\nthat she got from anybody, she deserved it, and it looks like \\\\nyou turned out pretty good.\\\\n    Ms. Williams, I do have a number of questions for you. You \\\\ntalk a lot about the quality of jobs that people get as \\\\ndelivering them from poverty. And not just this notion, you \\\\nknow, some of these oxymorons that we hear. Let me just--a \\\\ncouple of them I think I kind of wrote down. Yes, giving people \\\\nassistance locks people in poverty.\\\\n    I mean, you know, that is an oxymoron. You are helping \\\\nsomebody, and that is what locks them into poverty. I just want \\\\nyou to comment a little bit on particular one program that the \\\\nranking member didn&#x27;t mention, the Health Profession and \\\\nOpportunity Grant, which the Republicans on this committee \\\\nrefused to reauthorize, which would have provided--I still got \\\\ntime, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. No, no, it wasn&#x27;t me.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Oh, okay. Reclaiming my time, they, \\\\nyou know, they refused to renew it.\\\\n    But given the fact that there is 65,000 people turning 65 \\\\nevery single day, wouldn&#x27;t it have been helpful to develop \\\\nstackable kinds of credentials with people in the health care \\\\nindustry, considering that all of these people here, except for \\\\nme, are getting old every day?\\\\n    I would yield to you for your answer.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. I will say that it would not only benefit the \\\\nindividuals that would participate in the credentialing and \\\\nprogram, it would help the employers that desperately need the \\\\nworkers.\\\\n    Poor people don&#x27;t just want to be stable, they want to \\\\nthrive like everyone else. So that means that we have to \\\\nprovide living-wage employment and credentialing opportunities \\\\nto get them trained for the skills that they need. Healthy \\\\npeople equals healthy communities, and everyone will benefit \\\\nfrom that.\\\\n    So I just wanted to say when we--you know, I want to thank \\\\nthe members of this subcommittee and Ranking Member Davis for \\\\nsupporting programs like RIO and Second Chance Program, because \\\\nI would say that they have done an immense service to our \\\\nparticipants to get them out of poverty.\\\\n    When we look at Medicaid, when we look at insurance, when \\\\nwe look at food benefits, that is crisis stabilization, that is \\\\ngetting them on a footing so we can even talk about a job. \\\\nBecause if we can&#x27;t get those things, if we can&#x27;t get them into \\\\nhousing if there is a need because there is domestic violence, \\\\nthen we can&#x27;t talk to them about work. We can&#x27;t talk to them \\\\nabout training because they are worried about how they are \\\\ngoing to eat, they are worried about how they are going to \\\\nlive. So we have to address those things first before we can \\\\neven talk about a job, before we can even--and we have to talk \\\\nabout transportation. That is one thing I haven&#x27;t heard anybody \\\\ntalk about. How are they going to get to the job?\\\\n    We have situations where we are, like, we have a job, but \\\\npeople are like, it is so expensive on your bus card to get to \\\\nthe job. So it is like by the time they get done with their \\\\ntransportation costs, it is not even worth getting to the job \\\\nbecause it is too expensive. So we need employers that are near \\\\nthe individual.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I yield back, and \\\\nthank you for your indulgence.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you. I am going to next recognize \\\\nMr. Carey. Before I do that, I do want--Mr. Paprocki, you were \\\\nasked a question. If you could, just respond quickly.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, was that my time? \\\\nWell, that is one reason why I was really happy about your \\\\nindulgence because, you know, when your point of view is on the \\\\ntable, then the clock doesn&#x27;t even move. And so he responded to \\\\nmy question adequate to my satisfaction. He answered it.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Ms. Moore.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. And the witnesses have had time to \\\\ngive their testimony. Thank you.\\\\n    And of course, you are the chairman, so you can have as \\\\nmuch time as you might consume.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Until our planes leave. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Ms. Moore, for that.\\\\n    Mr. Paprocki, if you could, respond quickly.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. Well, Ms. Moore, first let me say, as a young \\\\nman----\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Do I get a chance to respond to \\\\nwhatever he is saying?\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. So we are going to let Mr. Paprocki \\\\nrespond.\\\\n    Go ahead.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. Who is from Wisconsin. Thank you for your \\\\nservice. I am grateful for that.\\\\n    You know, it was a struggle. The truth is I didn&#x27;t make any \\\\nmoney for eight months. When I came home here to Chicago, my \\\\npower had been cut off because I couldn&#x27;t pay my electricity \\\\nbill. I opened the door, I tried to turn on the light, it \\\\ndidn&#x27;t flip. And I smelled the rotting food that was coming out \\\\nof my refrigerator. So I understand what it is like not to have \\\\nfood. I went to go try to ride on the bus. I didn&#x27;t have $2 to \\\\ngo take a train ride in the City of Chicago. And I sat there \\\\nand I begged, right? And I begged for money, and I begged for \\\\nhelp to try to get that step.\\\\n    My point is not to say that the struggle doesn&#x27;t exist. I \\\\nfully understand it, and I have lived part of that struggle. \\\\nBut what I have also seen, not only through the data but \\\\nthrough life experience, is that work can pull people up, and \\\\nit can. We can tell individuals that what you do matters, and \\\\nthat is intrinsically what is happening in work. It is a \\\\nconversation. It is saying, I need you, right?\\\\n    Right now you are sitting here in front of me because we \\\\nneed you, right? And that is what I want to tell more of the \\\\npeople in our society is that your work matters. It has value, \\\\nand we need you. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Their work matters, but they need \\\\nenough money. And it looks like--I just repeat what I said. You \\\\ndidn&#x27;t have any barriers. You didn&#x27;t have children to take care \\\\nof. You didn&#x27;t need daycare. You are a White man in America. \\\\nYou are articulate beyond comparison to 90 percent of the \\\\npopulation.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Ms. Moore.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. And I congratulate you for pulling \\\\nyourself out of that situation under those circumstances, and I \\\\nyield back.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. We will now recognize Mr. Carey of Ohio.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. I want to thank the chairman. I also want to \\\\nthank the Ranking Member Davis, and I want to thank all of you \\\\nfor being here today.\\\\n    I had an opportunity to look at all of your bios because \\\\nthe flight from Washington, D.C. to here took less time than \\\\nthe cab ride from O&#x27;Hare to here. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. So I was able to read most of your testimony.\\\\n    And Matthew, because I cannot read your name from here, but \\\\nI am going to call you Matt, Matthew, you know, both you and \\\\nMs. Williams laid out some very, very--you laid out three \\\\nthings. And I always ask any person that comes into my office, \\\\n``Give me the three things that we can do in Congress.&#x27;&#x27; So, \\\\nMatthew, I am going to start with you. Ms. Williams, I am going \\\\nto go to you next.\\\\n    Expand upon those three things. Keep it within 40 seconds, \\\\nif you can, because I only have 4 minutes. Matthew, you are up.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. For the first, we have talked about benefits \\\\ncliffs. And the problems of incentives is that for a lot of \\\\nAmericans they have to decide, should I take this promotion? \\\\nAnd we hear this all the time.\\\\n    I have a woman, Ahey, who works at i.c.stars. She said, ``I \\\\nhave a lot of friends I know from back when I was poor. They \\\\nwon&#x27;t go for bigger jobs.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. They purposely go for minimum wage jobs \\\\nbecause Section 8 is on the line, food stamps are on the line, \\\\nand insurance are on the line. We need to fix that.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Okay, go to the next.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. The second one is about expanding \\\\napprenticeship opportunities.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. Look, there is a great way to lift people up. \\\\nThis same woman, Ahey, learned coding from one of our friends, \\\\ni.c.stars. Her first job was $56,000 a year. She immediately \\\\ngot promoted to $87,000 in a year. Now she is an entrepreneur \\\\nmaking more money than that. She was homeless with three \\\\nchildren, and she was able to pull herself out.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. And to that, you have my colleague from the \\\\nother side of the aisle, Nikki Budzinski, who is here in \\\\nIllinois, a dear friend of mine, we have co-introduced the LEAP \\\\nAct together, which is an apprenticeship program. So if you \\\\nhaven&#x27;t taken a look at it, please do. I think it is a good \\\\nbipartisan measure that can move forward. Go to your number \\\\nthree.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. The third is work requirements, similar to \\\\nwhat we saw in the year 1996. That was just for TANF.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. I think there is a huge opportunity for this \\\\ncommittee to expand it beyond that.\\\\n    I do want to say a quick quote from a Senator.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Make it quick.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. It said the culture of welfare must be \\\\nreplaced----\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. I need Ms. Williams.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI [continuing]. By the culture of work. The \\\\nculture of dependance must be replaced by a culture of self-\\\\nsufficiency.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. That came from our current President, Joe \\\\nBiden.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Okay, good deal. All right, Ms. Williams, give \\\\nme those three things real quick. I wrote them down quickly. I \\\\nreally like the 40--you just go, okay. Give me give me 1, 2, 3, \\\\ngive it in 40 seconds, please.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. All right. Thank you so much.\\\\n    I would say first continue to support grants or \\\\nopportunities like the Health Opportunity Grant.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. And tell me why.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. Because we serve all industries, right?\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. Or a lot of them. Health care was one of the \\\\ntop-performing, where the retention numbers were very high \\\\nbecause when people have a real opportunity as a frontline \\\\nposition, there is an opportunity for growth to be promoted \\\\nwithin the institution in the hospitals. They have massive \\\\nproblems with frontline----\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Got you, got you, yes, absolutely.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. So they want to promote people.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Okay, go to number two.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. But also RIO, as well as Second Chance Act, \\\\nbecause we are seeing the same kind of results in those \\\\nindustries, as well.\\\\n    I would say the second thing is legislation for collateral \\\\nconsequences. I mentioned before how we work with Illinois \\\\nPolicy Institute----\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS [continuing]. In a bipartisan coalition within \\\\nthe house and the senate in Illinois, because everyone \\\\nunderstood all these statutory barriers that are, in fact--that \\\\nmake no sense. It is the industries that were pushing them just \\\\nto exclude, you know, have exclusive markets.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Okay.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. But the person, you know, doesn&#x27;t have an \\\\nopportunity. There are real barriers just stopping people from \\\\ngoing into living wage opportunities, where they can make a \\\\ncareer, not a job.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. I got you.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. The----\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Give me your last one.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. And the third one is care coordination, \\\\nsupport for care coordination services.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Tell me about that real quick.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. So----\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Give me about 20 seconds, okay?\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. People want to work, but they have problems \\\\nnavigating all the various systems. And the systems, none of \\\\nthem, are speaking to each other. The training, the job, the \\\\nworkforce development, housing, health care, behavioral health, \\\\nnone of the systems are talking to each other, none of the \\\\ncorrectional systems in terms of Illinois Department of \\\\nCorrections or any other state agencies, no one is kind of \\\\ndoing this care coordination, where you have one person who is \\\\ndoing the navigation for a person----\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Got you. So it is a coordination issue, and I \\\\nappreciate that.\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. Bringing all the resources together to get \\\\nthe best return on investment.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. And I would encourage my colleagues, since we \\\\nare all going to take that two-hour drive to the airport today, \\\\nto read through your testimony. It was very insightful.\\\\n    Mr. Caldwell, I am not sure everything that you are doing \\\\nright now, but when you do decide to run for office, and I \\\\ndon&#x27;t care what side of the aisle it is, I will be knocking on \\\\ndoors for you.\\\\n    Mr. CALDWELL. All right. Thank you so much.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Ms. Schofield, I will tell you, this story about \\\\nyou living in the car, inspirational. Really happy. Where are \\\\nyour children today? You have got, like, three seconds. I am \\\\nsorry. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Ms. SCHOFIELD. My son works at the Dream Center. My \\\\ndaughter works for OSF.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. I am sure you are very proud.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOFIELD. I am.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. I want to thank you all. I want to thank the \\\\nchairman and the ranking member. And again, thank you all for \\\\ncoming out today. Thanks so much.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Carey. I now recognize Mr. \\\\nHern of Oklahoma.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the \\\\nwitnesses for your testimony today and this meeting today.\\\\n    This hearing is the very reason I am in Congress today. I \\\\nspent 35 years creating jobs from entry level to executive \\\\nlevel for across all kinds of businesses, quite frankly, 35 \\\\nyears as a McDonald&#x27;s franchisee, as a person who went through \\\\ncareer tech, vo tech when I was in high school. But more \\\\nimportantly, it is the foundation, the journey of life.\\\\n    A person who grew up in extraordinary poverty--my stepdad \\\\nwas the first-generation welfare recipient, he figured out how \\\\nto work the system. My mother had been married to an Air Force \\\\nguy, my dad, and they got divorced after he went to Vietnam for \\\\nthe third time, and she ended up having three more kids with \\\\nthe two that she had, my brother and I, with my dad. But he \\\\nfigured out how to go get checks from the mailbox. And every \\\\nprogram out there you can think of, I have looked at these, I \\\\nhave seen them.\\\\n    I can tell you that the only reason I am at where I am at \\\\ntoday is not the welfare, it kept our lights on. We had no \\\\nrunning water, no indoor plumbing until I was in the eighth \\\\ngrade. And I can tell you right now the thing that is really \\\\nnice about America is we try to take care of our people because \\\\nwhen you don&#x27;t care about your people, you don&#x27;t care as a \\\\nnation.\\\\n    And, you know, it is sad that this issue in America is \\\\npartisan at all. It should be bipartisan. We should all agree \\\\nthat every person should deserve a job and the opportunity to \\\\nwork. I am not politicizing this. This is a fact.\\\\n    But I can also tell you, Ms. Schofield and Ms. Williams, it \\\\nis different for a mom with a child than it is a single guy \\\\nthat can just go. And I saw this because my mother found out \\\\nthat her husband, my stepdad, had three other kids per three \\\\nother wives, nine other kids, and he had figured out how to get \\\\nall kinds of checks. So he figured out the system. And his \\\\nparents were hardworking individuals. I can still remember my \\\\nmother telling me to go take stuff back because food stamps \\\\nwouldn&#x27;t pay for it. I was the oldest of five kids.\\\\n    So I promised myself when I went to Congress, when I ran \\\\nfor office, never ran for anything else before, that I was \\\\ngoing to go work to do my best to protect the opportunities \\\\nthat gave a guy like me that came from absolutely nothing to \\\\nsucceed in life. And I will never take that back.\\\\n    Nobody can ever--you can be critical all you want to from a \\\\npolitical standpoint, but you just don&#x27;t know. And every one of \\\\nyou out there have a story, and you have been telling your \\\\nstory, and it is very important.\\\\n    But as we look, as we go forward here, we have got to \\\\nfigure out the programs that really work. What Congress is \\\\nreally good about is stacking programs on programs without ever \\\\nunderstanding whether they work or not. Last year, when I was \\\\non this subcommittee--I am not on the subcommittee any more, \\\\nbut it is a passion of mine. That is why I am here. Today is my \\\\n30th anniversary, and I am here because this is really \\\\nimportant to me. And I can tell you right now that we have \\\\nalmost 90 programs that we pay out over $1 trillion a year. The \\\\nlast number I saw was 1.2 trillion a year of federally-\\\\nsupported programs. And the Government Accountability Office \\\\ncan&#x27;t tell us which programs really work or not.\\\\n    So we are up here talking about adding other programs. What \\\\nwe should do is our Accountability Office should tell us what \\\\nis working and what is not, and we should redeploy those \\\\ndollars, not new dollars, but those dollars to programs that \\\\nactually work, modernize our assistance today because we should \\\\nbe helping those who had a bad spot in life. We are blessed to \\\\nbe the wealthiest nation in the world. We need to act like \\\\nthat. We need to make sure our people rise out of poverty.\\\\n    And yes, there is a narrative out there that the least of \\\\nus is better than the, you know, the best of the rest of the \\\\nworld. So what? So what? The reason we do what we do and we go \\\\nprotect democracy around the world is so people can have the \\\\nopportunities that we have in the United States of America.\\\\n    So I just want to say I want to thank you again for each of \\\\nyou being here. I am not asking--I mean, you guys have done a \\\\nphenomenal job.\\\\n    But Ms. Schofield, I have got all kinds of questions here \\\\nfor everybody, but I really wanted to just go to you, because \\\\nyour story is pretty powerful. And I would like for you to tell \\\\nus more about the Dream Center, about what you do for people \\\\nthat had the hardships you had. Because those are really where \\\\nthe hardships are, because there is really binary choices. You \\\\nlet your kids go somewhere else, which is really hard as a mom, \\\\nor you figure out how to take care of them.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOFIELD. We work very hard at the Dream Center at \\\\ncreating self-sustaining families. So we bring families in, and \\\\nwe spend a lot of time assessing them. You know, what do they \\\\nwant to do? Trade, school, you know, finding the best fit for \\\\nthat family.\\\\n    A lot of time in homeless services, there is just a quick \\\\nfix. Let&#x27;s throw somebody in an apartment. We want to spend \\\\ntime with people to find out what will keep their family above \\\\nwater, what will----\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Can I get the last two seconds, one second of my \\\\ntime to say to all of you all, I think that you all would \\\\nagree, and you have all said this, and I think everybody on \\\\nthis panel hopefully would agree, is we have got to solve this \\\\nissue, the benefits cliff, once and for all across all of these \\\\nprograms so that people have the ability to work themselves out \\\\nof this support. That is the only way it is going to work. \\\\nBecause at the end of the day, people are smart. If I can make \\\\nmore money not working and provide more for my family not \\\\nworking, why wouldn&#x27;t I do that?\\\\n    And shame on us, as the United States Congress, for \\\\nallowing that to happen. That is what we need to be working.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Hern. Thanks for spending \\\\nyour 30th anniversary with us. Happy anniversary.\\\\n    With that I recognize Mr. Panetta of California.\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. Thank you. You better be thanking his wife, \\\\nnot just him. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking \\\\nMember Davis. And, of course, thanks to the Pacific Garden \\\\nMission for hosting us.\\\\n    And yes, thank you to all of our witnesses who are here \\\\ntoday, and who are willing to share their personal and \\\\nprofessional background and what they hope for the future. So \\\\nthanks to all of you.\\\\n    Again, I am Jimmy Panetta. I represent the 19th \\\\ncongressional district out in California. It is not Chicago, it \\\\nis not Milwaukee, it is not Oklahoma. It is the coast of \\\\nCalifornia, okay? My district stretches from South San Jose, \\\\nSanta Cruz, Monterey, Big Sur, all the way down to northern San \\\\nLuis Obispo. Very proud of that district, exactly.\\\\n    Now, it is diverse. As dynamic as it is, it is still pretty \\\\ndiverse, especially with these communities of interest. But I \\\\ncan tell you, the one thing that really brings my district \\\\ntogether is affordability, or the lack of affordability and the \\\\nlack of affordable housing, the cost of owning, the cost of \\\\nrenting, the cost of living. And yes, that does lead to \\\\nhomelessness. Clearly, we are seeing that from Silicon Valley \\\\nto the wine country of northern San Luis Obispo. That is the \\\\nnumber-one issue.\\\\n    Now, some of the things that we are doing to address that, \\\\nespecially in South San Jose, is sort of the--one project, a \\\\ncouple of them that are around South San Jose because, like I \\\\nsaid, like you can imagine, South San Jose does have the \\\\nresources to create these types of things that the Federal \\\\nGovernment is helping them out with, as well, are these \\\\nemergency interim housing sites, places where individuals can \\\\nget their own room, their own bathroom, which can lead to \\\\nprivacy, safety, and ultimately, dignity. And ultimately, \\\\nstability upon which they can have the training necessary to \\\\nnot just get off the street, but to get back on their feet.\\\\n    And so I would like to ask Ms. Williams if, in her line of \\\\nwork, seeing this type of emergency housing, the sort of \\\\ninterim housing prior to permanent housing, prior to the \\\\ntraining, what are the benefits of that?\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. Thank you so much.\\\\n    We have seen firsthand the importance of having emergency \\\\nhousing through the work we are doing with the support of \\\\nReentry Network Collaborative, we were actually asked by the \\\\nstate to step in during COVID-19 because people were getting \\\\nreleased early, and they had nowhere to live, among all the \\\\nother needs that they had.\\\\n    And so in those situations we--I mean, I remember times \\\\nwhen I was on the phone, and I had to stop at a gas station to \\\\ntry to use my credit card to get people into housing. We had a \\\\nwoman right during Christmas, when all the homeless shelters \\\\nhad shut down, she came in our office. She had a four-day-old \\\\nchild and her four-year-old, and she had nowhere to go. We \\\\ncouldn&#x27;t get her into a shelter anywhere, and no one could live \\\\nwith that we--that she would be in her car. She was running \\\\nfrom a domestic violence situation. She had actually went to a \\\\nbaby shower and started going into labor.\\\\n    And so situations like that show you have to have emergency \\\\nhousing as part of your housing solution so that you can \\\\nprovide the temporary supports that will lead to permanent \\\\nhousing.\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. And kind of moving forward, how can that \\\\nemergency interim housing lead to what we all want for people \\\\nin that position, permanent housing?\\\\n    Ms. WILLIAMS. Well, having that immediate solution will \\\\nhelp stabilize that individual, right, so that they can make \\\\nsure that they have what they need. Because we don&#x27;t just \\\\nprovide that temporary housing, we also give them any kind of \\\\nfurnishings they need, we give them toiletries. In that case, \\\\nfor this young woman, we made sure she had formula for her \\\\nchild and any other services that she needed, but it got her in \\\\na mental state of mind where she was ready to hear us, right?\\\\n    Because we--the way we work in terms of empowerment is we \\\\nwork down--we sit down with them, we ask them what their \\\\ninterests are and what their goals are. And together we work \\\\nout a service plan, assessing their needs, and help come up \\\\nwith goals for them to achieve. And so housing, you have \\\\nsubsidized funding through the government, we are able to get \\\\nthem into housing, six months--and then it could be longer--\\\\nwhich will help them. Our goal is to move them to private pay, \\\\nbut we have to subsidize it up front sometimes to help them get \\\\nstable so that they can get the job so that they can then \\\\ntransition.\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. Okay, great. Look, I think in my time of \\\\nleaning into--because I do think this is an all-hands-on-deck \\\\nissue, especially when it comes to homelessness or the \\\\nunhoused, whatever you want to call it, we all know the issue.\\\\n    And I think what we can all acknowledge is that, yes, we \\\\nunderstand work ethic. I am an Italian American. I came from a \\\\nfamily of immigrants. I appreciate people who work hard and \\\\nwhat that provides them. But I just don&#x27;t think there is a \\\\nsilver bullet to solving this issue.\\\\n    And I think one of the issues that we failed to address in \\\\nthis hearing is the mental health aspect, because I think all \\\\nof your programs are very beneficial, but the problem is that, \\\\nwhen you have people who have mental health issues, \\\\nunfortunately it takes more than just hard work, it takes more \\\\nthan housing. And I think that is something that we really need \\\\nto lean into a little bit more at this level. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Panetta.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Mr. Chairman, if I may.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. For the record, just to prove that I am not a \\\\nreally bad guy, I just had 30 pink roses delivered to my wife. \\\\n[Laughter.]\\\\n    [Applause.]\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Hey, good job, Mr. Hern, good job.\\\\n    We will next recognize Mr. Moore of Utah.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Ranking \\\\nMember, for hosting us in your great state, and for doing this \\\\nhere at this really important place.\\\\n    Every one of your testimonies--to all the witnesses, every \\\\none of your statements just brings an amount of personal \\\\nexperience that is amazing. It is unprecedented. It is so \\\\nimportant and valuable. But your experience in helping solve \\\\nsome of these problems and outlining solutions is even more \\\\nimportant than what you have personally gone through.\\\\n    But also, I would like to just take a quick second to just \\\\nsay, to express my appreciation to those of you that are in the \\\\naudience for living a Christ-like example, working day in and \\\\nday out. I know many of you may work at this facility and in \\\\nother areas. Thank you for your work to provide for those that \\\\nare the most vulnerable, the poor and needy.\\\\n    I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day \\\\nSaints, and the work that they do is one of the proudest \\\\naspects that I have of my faith and its ability to find ways to \\\\nhelp people become self-sustaining. It is their number one \\\\nfocus on all matters of helping the poor and needy. And it is \\\\ntruly an inspiration to be involved. It is part of the reason \\\\nthat I wanted to be on this subcommittee. So thank you for all \\\\nof your efforts and the way that you serve your fellow \\\\nneighbors.\\\\n    Mr. Paprocki, continuing on with one of--thank you so much \\\\nfor your focus on the benefits cliff. I mean, it is such a math \\\\nproblem that we should be able to, in Congress, address this. \\\\nFolks involved in this back in my state in Utah, we have \\\\ngraphed this out, and what it looks like is atrocious on how we \\\\ndisincentivize work so much in our benefits cliffs. And it \\\\nwould be the one thing, if I had my magic wand--we should be \\\\nable to solve this. And it is the one thing that in this realm \\\\nwe need to do a better job of addressing. So thank you for your \\\\nfocus on it.\\\\n    I just introduced a bill. It is called the Returning \\\\nTemporary to TANF Act. And what it is going to do is require \\\\nstates to just put 25 percent of the resources that they \\\\nreceive towards workforce-related issues. Can you speak to the \\\\nvalue of keeping--you know, you do it in your second point \\\\nabout apprenticeship programs. Can you speak to the value of \\\\nrequiring resources towards workforce-related items to helping \\\\npeople get out of the poverty situation that they are in?\\\\n    Mr. PAPROCKI. Well, thank you, Mr. Moore, for your \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    You know, certainly, the goal is exactly what members of \\\\nthis committee have said, is how do we move people from poverty \\\\nto prosperity? And there is a lot of steps towards that, right?\\\\n    And one of the difficulties we have, just front-loaded, is \\\\nall of the different webs of welfare, right? Federal programs \\\\nhave Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP, child support, \\\\nhome energy assistance, supplemental security, and the list \\\\ngoes on and on and on. Then you throw in state-based \\\\nassistance, and it continues to go on even further.\\\\n    And, you know, when you start looking at what does success \\\\nlook like, you know, if you go through a theory of change, of, \\\\nyou know, inputs, activities, outputs, success, well, how do \\\\nyou measure that on 40 different scales, right? They all \\\\nconflict with each other, and that is why you have all of these \\\\ncliffs.\\\\n    So I think actually, first and foremost, what your home \\\\nstate of Utah has done has been fantastic. They have a one-door \\\\npolicy where, when you go in, they not only provide you with \\\\nfood and housing and those other things that are essential, but \\\\nthe goal is to try to get people to work. I think we got to \\\\nexpand that outside of the State of Utah into the other 49 \\\\nstates.\\\\n    But to your question, there is a huge gap. There is a huge \\\\ngap with training. Right now, here in the State of Illinois, we \\\\nhave 390,000 jobs available. We have 300,000 unemployed people, \\\\nmeaning that we have more than one job for every person right \\\\nnow. But there is a skills gap. And I think what you are \\\\ntalking about, making sure that some of the TANF dollars are \\\\ndedicated towards training, will go a huge way to make sure \\\\nthat we can take every one of those unemployed people and put \\\\nthem in high-quality, high-paying jobs.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you. I appreciate the comments on \\\\nUtah. It is good to hear it from someone outside the state, \\\\nbecause my colleagues are sick and tired of me saying it.\\\\n    Mr. Butler, last, as I wrap up here, oftentimes we hear \\\\nabout, well, we just need to put more money in this. We just \\\\nneed to do--you know, we would provide more funding for these \\\\ndifferent types of programs. We can&#x27;t just write more checks to \\\\nthis. We have more fundamental issues. Can you speak to the \\\\nbest way to serve people, other than just money?\\\\n    Mr. BUTLER. Yes, I think it comes back to getting people to \\\\nthe place where they can work. Folks coming into the homeless \\\\nshelters in the place that I work, it is getting those folks \\\\nstable and then using that asset-based approach on how they \\\\nwant to move forward, and then coming alongside of them and \\\\nhelping them to achieve that.\\\\n    Also, Mr. Panetta brought up the fact that the mental \\\\nhealth crisis in the United States of America is atrocious for \\\\nthe United States of America. When we have folks coming in that \\\\ncannot care for themselves mentally, physically, emotionally, \\\\nspiritually, and they have to wait seven months or a year for \\\\nan appointment to see a psychiatrist, it is absolutely--it is \\\\nbeyond belief that in the United States of America we have to \\\\nput up with that.\\\\n    So addressing those issues, funding health clinics to \\\\nprovide more providers and clinicians to care for our mentally \\\\nunstable folks, I think, it is vital to getting people--\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. You took the closing piece I would like \\\\nto say about my colleague from California. I appreciate that.\\\\n    Ms. Williams, also, the focus on recidivism, it is key to \\\\nmaking sure people are built up to be able to take this on.\\\\n    Thank you, Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Moore.\\\\n    Mrs. Steel of California.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for all \\\\nwitnesses for sharing your experiences with us in Chicago. I am \\\\njust so grateful.\\\\n    I am a first-generation Korean American. I was born in \\\\nKorea and raised in Japan. So English is my third language, and \\\\nI am so grateful to this country. And you know what? We can fix \\\\nthis broken system, and we can reform it, and we can just fix \\\\nthis.\\\\n    I used to serve in Los Angeles for family and children&#x27;s \\\\nservices, and we had about 75,000 children inside of the \\\\nsystem. And after they hit 18, half of them become homeless \\\\npeople and half of them, when they are getting out of the \\\\nsystem, half actually becoming--joining gang members. So it was \\\\nvery dangerous. And I serve in, actually, Los Angeles, 3 \\\\ncities, and I serve about 12 cities in Orange County. We have \\\\n11 million people in Los Angeles. We have over 85,000 homeless \\\\npeople living there. In Orange County 3.2 million people, and \\\\nwe have about 6,800 homeless people. So we really have to fix \\\\nthis, but I need the transition.\\\\n    So my question is, Mr. Montgomery, that you have almost a \\\\nlifetime of experience helping individuals go from homelessness \\\\nand government dependance to a job and self-sufficiency. Based \\\\non your work and experiences, can you describe how getting a \\\\njob can transform a person&#x27;s life, having transitioned from the \\\\ngovernment assistance?\\\\n    And what is it that makes the paycheck so much more \\\\nrewarding than government assistance?\\\\n    Mr. MONTGOMERY. Thank you very much, Congresswoman, for \\\\nyour question.\\\\n    You know, the one positive experience we had with TANF over \\\\nthe years--we had a lot of folks come and go, many of whom, you \\\\nknow, really didn&#x27;t last very long. But we had a young man come \\\\nin with his girlfriend. Each of them had a child from a prior \\\\nrelationship, and he actually had an ankle bracelet from his \\\\nlatest engagement with the judicial system. And they were TANF \\\\nearners. And the relationship was volatile. There were issues, \\\\nand not the least of which was his alcoholism. And eventually \\\\nit imploded.\\\\n    But he remained, and he kept working. He was a fantastic \\\\nvolunteer. He had the best attitude. He was the friendliest. He \\\\ndid whatever you asked him to do. But we really started pouring \\\\ninto him, more than anything, praise, just affirming who he \\\\nwas, and what we saw, and the capacity that was there until one \\\\nday he came in and he somewhat sheepishly said he had gotten a \\\\njob, and it was at a fast food restaurant. And so he felt like \\\\nit wasn&#x27;t that great of a job. But we praised him for that, \\\\nright? We praised and celebrated that he had done this for \\\\nhimself.\\\\n    He had grown up in an unhealthy environment in which his \\\\ninherent value and worth hadn&#x27;t been affirmed and had never \\\\nbeen celebrated. Within a year he was running that location. He \\\\nwas a general manager, and he and his son then had their own \\\\nhome, and he was a more present father. It doesn&#x27;t mean life \\\\nstopped having its challenges, but who he saw himself as \\\\nchanged.\\\\n    But what I find, more often than not, for that to happen \\\\nsomeone has to have someone else believe in them before they \\\\ncan believe in themselves. And unfortunately, the systems that \\\\nwe have created do the very opposite of that. Thank you.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Thank you. In California fast food workers are \\\\nactually getting paid $20 minimum wage at this point.\\\\n    Mr. Butler, Pathway Ministries helps thousands of \\\\nindividuals they serve to obtain and maintain employment before \\\\nthey help place them in alternative and independent living \\\\narrangement. Pathway Ministries accepts no Federal dollars, \\\\ncorrect?\\\\n    Mr. BUTLER. Correct.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. And are there Federal restrictions that make it \\\\nimpossible for you to carry out your work-focused mission?\\\\n    Mr. BUTLER. Well, first, we are thankful that the \\\\ngovernment supplies money and funding for programs and \\\\nlegislations to address poverty issues that we have in our \\\\ncountry and the oppression, including homelessness. But we are \\\\na faith-based organization, and we are a faith-forward \\\\norganization. And we desire to share the love of God and God&#x27;s \\\\nview of life with everyone we serve without restriction.\\\\n    While we don&#x27;t ever force or coerce our belief system on \\\\nanyone, we are meeting people where they are at, but we do want \\\\nto share our beliefs and our perspective that Jesus is the \\\\nanswer to all of our brokenness. And because of our holistic \\\\napproach, we don&#x27;t want to create a distinction between the \\\\nsecular and the sacred, because we believe part of our \\\\nspiritual life is work, and part of our spiritual life is the \\\\ndignity that comes from work.\\\\n    And so focusing on those physical, spiritual, emotional, \\\\nand mental aspects, while we could likely qualify for \\\\ngovernment funding for work readiness programs, we just don&#x27;t \\\\naccept it because we want to keep the spirituality part in \\\\nplace with our work lives.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Thank you so much.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Mrs. Steel.\\\\n    That concludes our questions this morning. I want to just \\\\nrelay what many of my colleagues have said, and want to thank \\\\nyou for your testimony here today. You have been genuine, and \\\\nsincere, and insightful, and substantive, and have been very \\\\nhelpful to us as we take the information that we receive from \\\\nyou today through the questions and answers through our site \\\\nvisit yesterday with Pastor Brooks at Project HOOD, and being \\\\nhere today with Pastor Phil. We are grateful.\\\\n    And I think it also--you know, we live in the greatest \\\\ncountry in the world, and there are people that don&#x27;t always \\\\nsee the benefits of living in the greatest country in the \\\\nworld. And so it is figuring out, from a public policy \\\\nstandpoint, how do we bring more people into that?\\\\n    And hearing particularly from you, Mr. Butler, and Ms. \\\\nSchofield, on your journey and your path, and you, Mr. \\\\nPaprocki, on how you have been able to live that American \\\\ndream, and live in the greatest country in the world, and so \\\\nthat is what we need to think about.\\\\n    And we have heard some really wonderful things today about \\\\nending the benefits cliff, and talking about tax credits for \\\\napprenticeships, and looking at how we institute work \\\\nrequirements appropriately, looking at the mental health and \\\\nbehavioral health crisis, housing crisis, reentry from our \\\\nprison population. Now we have a responsibility to go back and \\\\ntry to work in a bipartisan way to fix many of the problems we \\\\nhave talked about here today, and bring more people into living \\\\nthe American dream, which we can do in this country.\\\\n    So again, Pastor Phil, thank you. Thank you to all of you.\\\\n    And I would just remind--I know the audience provided \\\\nfeedback. If you have not provided the feedback on the \\\\nclipboards we handed out, please give your suggestions so that \\\\nwe can have that feedback and take that back to Washington, \\\\nD.C.\\\\n    And lastly, members will be advised that we have two weeks \\\\nto submit written questions to be answered later in writing. \\\\nThose questions and your answers will be made part of the \\\\nformal hearing record.\\\\n    With that, our committee stands adjourned.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Chairman?\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Yes, Mr. Davis.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Before you hit the gavel, let me thank you and \\\\nChairman Smith for bringing this hearing to Chicago. I know \\\\nthat you could have gone to Peoria. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. I brought Peoria here. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. The waterway is not quite as large.\\\\n    But I also want to thank all of the witnesses, all of the \\\\npeople from the community who have come and been a part of \\\\nthis. It is indeed a historic setting.\\\\n    It is also a warmly regarded hearing, where we have been \\\\nable to share thoughts, ideas, and information with the \\\\nunderstanding that we will continue to move to bring to the \\\\nforefront those solutions, rather than just the questions and \\\\nthe answers.\\\\n    So again, thank you and Chairman Smith for being in \\\\nChicago, if not the greatest country but the greatest city in \\\\nthe United States of America. [Applause.]\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Well said, Mr. Davis. And again, I want to \\\\nthank all of you for your tremendous testimony here today.\\\\n    And our hearing is adjourned.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n                    LOCAL SUBMISSIONS FOR THE RECORD\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]    \\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n                    PUBLIC SUBMISSONS FOR THE RECORD\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n                                  [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73184/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"03/21/2024\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"HEARING WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY, MARTIN O'MALLEY\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73184, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"Ways and Means\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                     HEARING WITH THE COMMISSIONER\\\\n                  OF SOCIAL SECURITY, MARTIN O&#x27;MALLEY\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n                                HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                    SUBCOMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SECURITY\\\\n\\\\n                                AND THE\\\\n\\\\n                    SUBCOMMITTEE ON WORK AND WELFARE\\\\n\\\\n                                 OF THE\\\\n\\\\n                      COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS\\\\n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             SECOND SESSION\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                             MARCH 21, 2024\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                          Serial No. 118-SS06\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n         Printed for the use of the Committee on Ways and Means\\\\n         \\\\n [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n \\\\n                              __________\\\\n\\\\n                   U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE                    \\\\n56-478                     WASHINGTON : 2024                    \\\\n          \\\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \\\\n                      COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS\\\\n\\\\n                    JASON SMITH, Missouri, Chairman\\\\nVERN BUCHANAN, Florida               RICHARD E.

Drew Ferguson \\\\n[chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security] presiding.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Good afternoon, everyone. We will call \\\\nthe hearing to order.\\\\n    I first would like to thank Commissioner O&#x27;Malley for \\\\njoining us today.\\\\n    Thank you for being here today.\\\\n    This is an important time to talk about the future of the \\\\nSocial Security Administration. There are going to be an awful \\\\nlot of topics that come up today, and one of the things in this \\\\nthat we are going to focus on is the efficiency and the \\\\noperation of the administration itself.\\\\n    We will continue to have discussions throughout this year, \\\\ndeveloping really good frameworks for discussions about \\\\nbipartisan solutions to solvency. But clearly, today&#x27;s hearing \\\\nwill be on the focus of the improvement and the steps that you \\\\nhave taken, Mr. O&#x27;Malley, for making the customer service \\\\nbetter, efficiencies better, and making sure that our citizens&#x27; \\\\ndata is protected.\\\\n    But thank you again for being here. I am going to be fairly \\\\nshort here with my opening comments, because of the time and \\\\nthe vote schedule. But we look forward to a robust and healthy \\\\ndiscussion.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. With that I am going to call on Mr. \\\\nLaHood for his opening comments.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Well, thank you, Chairman Ferguson.\\\\n    Welcome, Commissioner O&#x27;Malley. I want to thank you for \\\\nbeing here today and the opportunity to visit with you about \\\\nthe Social Security Administration. And I want to thank you for \\\\nyour prior service as governor of Maryland, and also for you \\\\nstepping up to take this position, and your leadership. And we \\\\nlook forward to a robust and constructive dialogue today.\\\\n    I will just say a couple of opening remarks, and Chairman \\\\nFerguson touched on customer service and your mission there. \\\\nIt&#x27;s critical that we work together to ensure that seniors and \\\\nthat millions of Americans with disabilities that depend on \\\\nyour agency get the services they need.\\\\n    You have a tall task before you, and I have heard from \\\\nnumerous constituents from across my district, covering much of \\\\nthe central and northwest part of the state, about the Social \\\\nSecurity Administration&#x27;s struggle to provide timely, \\\\nresponsive services. Since the beginning of last year, my \\\\noffice has worked on 150 Social Security constituent cases, \\\\nwith about one-fourth of them still open.\\\\n    As Chairman of the Work and Welfare Subcommittee, I have a \\\\nparticular interest in your plans that would impact the \\\\nSupplement Security Income, or SSI--we talked a little bit \\\\nabout this when we had an opportunity to visit last week--and \\\\nthe individuals it serves. Our subcommittee is overseeing SSI, \\\\nalong with multiple Federal programs that help Americans most \\\\nin need, need to be reviewed and retrofitted.\\\\n    One of the main concerns is the high rate of improper \\\\npayments in SSI. In fiscal year 2022, the agency reported 5.3 \\\\nbillion in improper payments, 4.6 billion of which were \\\\noverpayments. Many of these occur through no fault of those who \\\\nhave been improperly paid, and place a heavy burden on \\\\nrecipients, who often face a difficult and time-intensive \\\\nprocess to resolve the issue.\\\\n    I appreciate the Social Security Administration&#x27;s recent \\\\nrulemaking to put in place the Payroll Information Exchange to \\\\ncombat improper payments, as requested by myself and Chairman \\\\nFerguson nearly nine years after Congress authorized it. We \\\\nshould use every available tool and technology available to \\\\nmake sure we get payments right the first time. However, that \\\\ndoes not mean that the SSA should sidestep Congress and \\\\nunilaterally use rulemaking to change eligibility rules in the \\\\nname of administrative simplification and reducing improper \\\\npayments.\\\\n    In the last two years, SSA has quietly released several \\\\nproposed rules that continue the Biden Administration&#x27;s \\\\nexecutive overreach that threatens to cost taxpayers billions. \\\\nBy my count, SSA has four proposed rules that would result in \\\\n$40 billion in unpaid-for mandatory spending in the Social \\\\nSecurity and SSI programs.\\\\n    For example, SSA has proposed expanding the definition of a \\\\n``public assistance household,&#x27;&#x27; at an estimated 10-year cost \\\\nof nearly $16 billion.\\\\n    Another rule proposes to reduce the level of scrutiny given \\\\nto the disability claimant&#x27;s ability to do past work--has an \\\\nestimated 10-year cost of 20 billion.\\\\n    And it has not gone unnoticed how the SSA is overstepping \\\\nCongress&#x27;s authority to make spending decisions, and I hope we \\\\ncan work together to ensure that these rules are not finalized \\\\nin their current form or without offsetting costs as called for \\\\nin the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act signed by President \\\\nBiden last year.\\\\n    Finally, our subcommittee is interested in working with you \\\\non finding ways to support what I call the dignity of work, and \\\\nwe have been focused on that in the Work and Welfare \\\\nSubcommittee. All of our government programs need to be \\\\noriented to provide every opportunity for able-bodied \\\\nindividuals, no matter their circumstances, to grow their \\\\ncapacity and be connected to meaningful work.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. With that, Mr. Commissioner, we look \\\\nforward to a good hearing today. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Next we will go to my friend and \\\\ncolleague, a ranking member on the Social Security \\\\nSubcommittee, Mr. Larson.\\\\n    You are now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. LARSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good to have \\\\nCommissioner O&#x27;Malley before us today.\\\\n    And your distinguished service throughout a lifetime is \\\\nexceptional here in Washington, D.C. to have someone of your \\\\ncaliber who is managing one of the nation&#x27;s most important \\\\nagencies. I commend you for your leadership, and I look forward \\\\nto continuing to work together to ensure that the nearly 70 \\\\nmillion Americans who are on Social Security continue to \\\\nreceive the benefits they have earned.\\\\n    I applaud your quick attention to addressing the impact of \\\\noverpayment collections on seniors and people with disabilities \\\\nin a way that puts the needs of beneficiaries first.\\\\n    I also want to applaud President Biden for requesting 15.4 \\\\nbillion for SSA&#x27;s administrative budget, a 90 percent increase \\\\nover the 2023 level. We must ensure that the Social Security \\\\nAdministration has proper funding to address customer service.\\\\n    Since 2010, SSA&#x27;s funding has dropped by 17 percent, yet \\\\nthere are more than 21 percent more beneficiaries than there \\\\nwere 14 years ago, and 10,000 Baby Boomers a day, 10,000 a day \\\\nbecome eligible for Social Security. Thanks to those cuts, the \\\\nagency&#x27;s staffing is on track to hit a more than 50-year low.\\\\n    The answer is clear: If we are going to serve the people in \\\\nthe way that they deserve and that they have paid for, SSA \\\\nneeds funding and the staffing to adequately do it. Yet during \\\\nlast year&#x27;s appropriations process our colleagues on the other \\\\nside voted to slash the budget by 30 percent. Republicans are \\\\nstarving the Social Security Administration, and we wonder why \\\\nthere are issues like backlogs, long wait times, and accidental \\\\noverpayments.\\\\n    The customer service crisis isn&#x27;t an accident, and it&#x27;s not \\\\nmismanagement by a Federal agency. Let there be no mistake: \\\\nUnder-funding SSA is an attack on hard-working Americans&#x27; \\\\nearned benefits. This is no entitlement. These are earned \\\\nbenefits that everybody in this committee is aware of and \\\\nknows. Defunding SSA&#x27;s ability to properly process payments is \\\\na de facto attempt to cut benefits.\\\\n    We do not need to look hard to see that cutting benefits is \\\\nthe goal here. Just yesterday the Republican Study Committee \\\\nproposed more than 1.5 trillion cuts to Social Security, more \\\\nthan double what they proposed last year. And this to an agency \\\\nthat doesn&#x27;t add a single penny to the debt or deficit but goes \\\\nto help out every single one of your constituents, whose money \\\\nthey receive goes right back into your district.\\\\n    Just last week former-President Trump called for cuts to \\\\nSocial Security benefits on national television, and House \\\\nRepublicans have recently been pushing to pass a closed-door \\\\nfiscal commission that would fast-track unamendable Social \\\\nSecurity cuts to the floor for an up-or-down vote during a lame \\\\nduck session. Now, there is democracy for you.\\\\n    We don&#x27;t need to slash people&#x27;s hard-earned benefits; we \\\\nneed to act now to protect and enhance them. Earlier this month \\\\nPresident Biden said he would protect and strengthen Social \\\\nSecurity during the State of the Union Address. His budget \\\\nrequest calls for improving benefits for the elderly and people \\\\nwith disabilities, and a nine percent increase in the funding \\\\nneeded to tackle this customer service crisis.\\\\n    We have a bill, Social Security 2100, that would enhance \\\\nbenefits across the board, repeal WEP and GPO, and we would \\\\nalso cut taxes on more than 23 million Americans and eliminate \\\\nthe dangerous 5-month waiting period to receive disability \\\\npayments. It does this by making sure the wealthy pay their \\\\nfair share. It scraps the cap on people who make more than \\\\n$400,000 a year.\\\\n    I hold hearings all the time. I ask people in the hearing \\\\nto raise their hand if they are making more than $400,000. To \\\\nthis date I have yet to have anyone in any town hall that I \\\\nhave been in raise their hand.\\\\n    And while my colleagues are busy doubling down and trying \\\\nto find a back-door way to cut Social Security, Democrats are \\\\nstanding up, along with the President, to enhance Social \\\\nSecurity. The last time it was enhanced, Richard Nixon was the \\\\nPresident of the United States. It is in line with budgets they \\\\nhave proposed with Trump&#x27;s call to cut benefits, and with their \\\\npush for a closed-door fiscal commission.\\\\n    Congress must adequately fund SSA. And to do so the \\\\nPresident has selected an individual who understands, as he \\\\nsaid in his remarks the other day, the importance of compassion \\\\nin terms of addressing the most important and number-one anti-\\\\npoverty program for the elderly and for our children.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Larson. Next we will call \\\\non the distinguished gentleman, Mr. Davis from Illinois, \\\\nranking member of the Work and Welfare Subcommittee.\\\\n    Mr. Davis you are recognized.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to welcome \\\\nCommissioner O&#x27;Malley.\\\\n    We look forward to working with you, sir, to protect and \\\\nstrengthen the Social Security Administration and the benefits \\\\nit provides.\\\\n    Every American relies on Social Security for birth-to-death \\\\nprotection. For generations, every American has counted on SSA \\\\nto deliver Social Security and supplemental security income \\\\nbenefits, or SSI, at critical life moments: when they retire, \\\\nbecome disabled, fall into poverty, as they age or lose a wage \\\\nearner. I look forward to working with you to keep that promise \\\\nto my constituents in Chicago and across the country.\\\\n    I also appreciate that the President&#x27;s budget continues his \\\\nstrong, unwavering support for universal, comprehensive, paid \\\\nfamily and medical leave, the kind of leave that is guaranteed \\\\nin nearly every other country in the world. So many workers and \\\\nsmall businesses have told us that paid leave is the key to \\\\nkeeping talented, hard-working individuals in the workforce, \\\\nand unlocking our economy&#x27;s potential. Last Congress, Democrats \\\\non this committee passed universal paid leave legislation for \\\\nthe first time in Congress&#x27;s history. We look forward to doing \\\\nit again with the President&#x27;s help, and making it the law of \\\\nthe land.\\\\n    Importantly, SSA works for every American, and the budget \\\\nwould give you the tools to do it well. I am alarmed that the \\\\nHouse Republican chaos and dysfunction has delayed SSA&#x27;s budget \\\\nthis year, and forced a hiring freeze, compounding staffing \\\\nchallenges forced by past budget cuts. Those staffing shortages \\\\nhave done unacceptable damage to the amount of time that \\\\nAmericans have to wait for SSA&#x27;s vital help, and Congress needs \\\\nto fix that now.\\\\n    Staffing shortages and the loss of skilled staff affect our \\\\nconstituents in other ways, too. For example, 1 in every 365 \\\\nBlack children is born with sickle cell traits, which puts them \\\\nat high risk for life-threatening conditions, and subjects them \\\\nto debilitating pain. Children with sickle cell rely on SSI \\\\nbenefits so their families can afford basic necessities and \\\\ntake time off work to make sure they get medical care.\\\\n    My Democratic colleagues on the Worker and Family Support \\\\nSubcommittee recently flagged an urgent concern for the \\\\ncommissioner related to the serious flaws in the current \\\\ncriteria for determining whether children with sickle cell \\\\nqualify for SSI. I know the commissioner heard me about what a \\\\npriority this is for fixing it.\\\\n    I also know that revising the criteria will take hard work \\\\nfrom trained staff and providing the necessary resources that \\\\nis Congress&#x27;s job. I look forward to partnering with you, \\\\nCommissioner, for immediate action, and even more pleased to \\\\nsee the energy and commitment that you and President Biden are \\\\nbringing to the vitally important job of protecting Social \\\\nSecurity, our economy, and the most vulnerable Americans.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Davis.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;Malley, you are now recognized for five minutes for \\\\nopening remarks. Thank you again for being here.\\\\n\\\\n STATEMENT OF MARTIN O&#x27;MALLEY, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank you for \\\\nthe courtesy of the time we have spent one on one. I hope that \\\\nis the beginning of many more conversations.\\\\n    And Mr. Chairmen, Ranking Members, whether we are talking \\\\nabout real people in Georgia or Illinois, Chicago, Connecticut, \\\\nor any other part of this country, I think we can all agree, \\\\nwhatever party we are from, Social Security touches all of us. \\\\nAnd so I really want to thank you for having this hearing.\\\\n    I say that because it has been nine years since Congress \\\\nhas given Social Security a budget hearing. And during those \\\\nnine years it has been a downward decline, in terms of customer \\\\nservice at Social Security. So I am looking forward, as the \\\\nhearing goes on, talking about SSI simplification, talking \\\\nabout earned benefits, sickle cell, the dignity of work.\\\\n    And I finally wanted to, by word of thanks, I want to thank \\\\nyou for the staff members of this committee and your own \\\\noffices that you have sent to our headquarters in Baltimore to \\\\nobserve and sit in and watch Security Stat, which is our new \\\\nperformance management regimen, which has snapped us out of a \\\\nsleepy kind of annual approach to delivering results, and \\\\ninstead we are now focused every two weeks on how we can \\\\ndeliver better services for the people of our country.\\\\n    The truth is today, as I come before you as a freshly-\\\\nminted commissioner, Social Security is now serving more \\\\ncustomers than ever before with fewer staff than at any time in \\\\n27 years. I was surprised to learn that Social Security now \\\\noperates on less than one percent of its annual benefit \\\\npayments. This operating overhead, that means that over the \\\\nlast 9 years, without the attention that you are giving this \\\\nagency, we have seen a decline that amounts to an effective cut \\\\nof about 17 or 20 percent, depending on how you look at it, \\\\nover those last 9 years.\\\\n    By way of comparison, other insurance companies, if you \\\\nmeasure their administrative overhead compared to their \\\\nbenefits payments, Allstate operates on 19 percent of its \\\\nannual benefit payments; Liberty Biberty operates on 24 percent \\\\nof its annual benefit payments; and Social Security, at least \\\\nbefore 2018, operated on 1.2. We are now down to less than one \\\\npercent.\\\\n    So what is the result of that? The result of that is, \\\\ntoday, customers now wait an average of 39 minutes when they \\\\ncall the 800-number. That is an average. Sometimes it can be \\\\nnorth of an hour. The result of those nine years of decline is \\\\nthat people with disabilities wait nearly eight months, on \\\\naverage, for a decision on their application, and then another \\\\nseven months if they have to appeal.\\\\n    And of course, we have all seen the 60 Minutes piece--and \\\\nyou have heard it through your phones and in your offices--\\\\nabout overpayments, and the additional time it takes us now to \\\\ncatch up and address those overpayments.\\\\n    So this, briefly, is what we are doing about it, and I look \\\\nforward to unpacking more and going deeper in response to your \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    We have recruited a new team at the top of Social Security.\\\\n    We have launched a cross-cutting performance management \\\\nprogram called Security Stat, where for one blessed hour every \\\\ntwo weeks on a rotating basis we lock the whirlwind outside the \\\\ndoor, and we singularly focus on field operations, with the \\\\nlatest evidence on what is happening where in our country, what \\\\nare the average processing times, et cetera.\\\\n    After that it is human resources, because Social Security, \\\\nat the beginning and the end of the day, is a large, human \\\\nresources organization serving the people of our country.\\\\n    Another one of those meetings is on initial disability \\\\ndeterminations.\\\\n    Another one is on the ALJ hearings and reducing the time it \\\\ntakes for those.\\\\n    Another one, the only one that is closed-door, is about \\\\nfraud, getting inside the turning radius of fraudsters.\\\\n    And then the seventh one is about notices. I am sure your \\\\nconstituents call you about notices they get from Social \\\\nSecurity and they can&#x27;t make heads and tails of them.\\\\n    And then, of course, the eighth one is about overpayments.\\\\n    So in conclusion, the American people work their whole \\\\nlives to earn the benefits of Social Security. Nobody gave them \\\\nany discretion about whether or not they paid their FICA taxes \\\\nevery two weeks in the payroll. They paid it. It wasn&#x27;t in \\\\ntheir discretion. And not only were they paying for the \\\\nbenefits they earned, they were paying for the customer service \\\\nnecessary to access those benefits.\\\\n    To continue to reduce staffing while beneficiaries rise \\\\nwill ultimately undermine not only trust in this program, but \\\\ntrust in our country itself. President Biden&#x27;s investment in \\\\nSocial Security for the people of this nation is a solid step \\\\nforward to restoring customer service, and I strongly urge that \\\\nyou support his budget proposal of 15.4 billion. We want to \\\\nwork with Congress to do better by the American people.\\\\n    And finally, I want to thank the hard-working men and women \\\\nof Social Security, those that haven&#x27;t quit yet, for getting up \\\\nevery day and going to work, notwithstanding the overwhelming \\\\nworkloads and numbers of customers that they have the duty to \\\\nserve.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. O&#x27;Malley follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you for your opening remarks. We \\\\nwill now begin the question-and-answer session.\\\\n    You know, look, we have all recognized how important this \\\\nprogram is. And, you know, as you look through the years, and \\\\nwe talk about, you know, how Social Security has changed or not \\\\nchanged, I think it is important to recognize that \\\\nbeneficiaries now, because of the formula, are receiving more \\\\nbenefits than they ever have. And there has been a steady \\\\nincrease because of the way the program is structured.\\\\n    I also think it is important to point out--and we--I just \\\\ncame from a--before votes, a budget hearing, and OMB Director \\\\nYoung was there. And she and I got into an exchange, and I was \\\\ntrying to get her to explain, in the President&#x27;s budget, if you \\\\nlook at how--if you look over the 10-year period, the \\\\nPresident&#x27;s budget cuts about $17 billion worth of payroll \\\\ntaxes from the beneficiaries. And the Treasury Secretary, who \\\\nwas over on the Senate side doing her thing, and made the \\\\ncomment in an exchange with Senator Cassidy that the President \\\\nreally didn&#x27;t have a plan, he had just guiding principles.\\\\n    Well, I believe that we are going to have to come together \\\\nin a bipartisan way to fix, really, some of these long-term \\\\nsolvency issues. But in the meantime, there are things that we \\\\ncan do to improve customer service, and the efficiency, and the \\\\nbetter use of taxpayer dollars as it relates to the operation \\\\nof the Social Security Administration.\\\\n    And Mr. O&#x27;Malley, in our meeting I got a sense that you are \\\\nsincere about doing that. So the first question that I have for \\\\nyou, you have got a relatively short runway here. Your term \\\\nexpires in 2025. If you could do one thing, if you could do one \\\\nthing that was lasting in the Administration past your tenure, \\\\nwhat would that be?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Mr. Chairman, if I could do one thing that \\\\nwould last into the future, you know--I pause a little bit here \\\\nbecause, having served as mayor and served as governor, I have \\\\nseen many of the things that I thought would last for a long \\\\ntime dissipate as soon as the next fellow came in.\\\\n    I think the most important thing that I can do that will \\\\nhave the most lasting impact is to change the culture at Social \\\\nSecurity so that we realize that all of those huge numbers that \\\\nwe deal with are real people. If I can change that--you know, \\\\nit struck me in walking around that building that there are \\\\nvery few walls that even have pictures of the human beings that \\\\nwe serve. We have kind of gotten away from that in the pressure \\\\nand the trauma, if you will, of all of the rising workloads. If \\\\nI could change one thing, it would be to use modern \\\\ntechnology--you know, the data, the map, the measures--to \\\\nrealize that each of those dots on the map represents a real \\\\nhuman being.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. If you can do that, we will probably all \\\\nchip in for your statue, if you can change the culture of your \\\\nbureaucracy.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Not a brick, Mr. Chairman, not a brick.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. A different type of question here. You \\\\nhave seen,or the agency has seen, a decline from about 87 \\\\nmillion calls down to about 81 million calls on an annual \\\\nbasis, and wait times have doubled. Part of the problem I think \\\\nwe discussed was implementation of the new phone system. Can \\\\nyou tell us where that process is, and how you expect that to \\\\nimprove?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. The short context of this is that \\\\nshortly before the pandemic my predecessor decided to launch on \\\\na new contract for the phone system that would integrate the \\\\n1,210 field offices in each of your districts with the \\\\nheadquarters phones and the 1-800 phone number. Then the \\\\npandemic hit, and everything was all about closing down the \\\\nfield offices, standing up an 800-number really quickly, and \\\\ntrying to do everything through that 800-number.\\\\n    We have struggled with the technology and an 800-number \\\\nthat has not lived up to what we expected of it in terms of the \\\\nbusiness intelligence to balance the load, to give usmanagement \\\\ninformation about who is calling when so that we can have the right \\\\nstaffing to cover it. And we are open to all options to improve that as \\\\nquickly as possible.\\\\n    I was on the phone----\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. So----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY [continuing]. With the CEO of Verizon, and we \\\\nhope to improve that.\\\\n    In the meantime, we do everything we can, and a little bit \\\\nof good news here. While our average wait time has been 39 \\\\nminutes for the last several months, over the last few weeks we \\\\ngot that down to 31 minutes. Nothing to write home about, but \\\\nit is at least--we are at least getting it headed in a better \\\\ndirection, with leading actions that deflect calls on the front \\\\nend and changes that allow us to resolve the call on the first \\\\ntime once people get through.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. All improvement is good. And, you know, \\\\nthe Administration has spent about $300 million on this \\\\ncontract so far, implementing the system. I just think it is \\\\nreally important and I think, and I hope, that you will be this \\\\nkind of commissioner that understands that, ultimately, you \\\\nhave got to get this under control. You have got to get the \\\\nsystems going, and hold the providers accountable.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. And while simultaneously doing \\\\neverything that you can.\\\\n    One final question here, and this has to do with disability \\\\napplications. We have seen a decade-long decline in disability \\\\napplications. And despite that, we have got about a 1.2 million \\\\ncaseload that is on backlog. But yet we had seen $100 million \\\\nbeing spent to bring more in. So you got 1.2 million in \\\\nbacklog, there was an effort to, because of equity initiatives, \\\\nto get more in.\\\\n    Can you tell us how much in Social Security--the Social \\\\nSecurity Administration has spent on these initiatives?\\\\n    And do you think this is an effective use this has been an \\\\neffective use, this $100 million for equity initiatives, has \\\\nthis been a good use of the limited resources of the \\\\nAdministration?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Well, I think that depends on what we learn \\\\nfrom that effort and what we do moving forward.\\\\n    We have seen a great decline in the numbers of people that \\\\napply for both SSI and also for Social Security disability--not \\\\nas great as a percentage on those, respectively.\\\\n    I think what we learned from that advertising campaign--and \\\\nit is hard to disaggregate. I mean, it is hard to determine, \\\\nMr. Chairman, as we saw increased numbers of application in \\\\nSSI, whether that was directly attributable to the ad campaign, \\\\nor was that directly attributable to the fact that people were \\\\ncoming out of the pandemic, and it is a natural sort of follow-\\\\non effect?\\\\n    I believe that the better approach is going to come from \\\\nmuch more targeted outreach to the populations that we already \\\\nknow are most likely able to qualify for SSI. That is going to \\\\nrequire a level of data sharing between our agency and, you \\\\nknow, HHS, and others. And----\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Mr. Commissioner, my free advice is to \\\\nget the existing workload under control, get it back on track--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON [continuing]. Before we go dumping more \\\\ncases into it. And I look forward to your success on that.\\\\n    Now I will call on my colleague, Mr. Larson, the ranking \\\\nmember, for five minutes of questions.\\\\n    You are recognized.\\\\n    Mr. LARSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And again, thank you, Commissioner O&#x27;Malley, for being \\\\nhere. And in your testimony the other day before the Senate you \\\\nsaid people among us really need their neighbors to care about \\\\nthem. I think all of us on this body and the panel you were \\\\naddressing would agree that there probably is no more important \\\\nprogram our country has ever created that expresses our \\\\ncompassion for our neighbors quite so much as Social Security. \\\\nI believe that that is true of this committee and all the \\\\nmembers on both sides that understand truly the impact of this \\\\nunbelievable commission that, as you pointed out in your \\\\ntestimony--and I come from an insurance sector place in the \\\\nUnited States in Hartford, Connecticut, studied at the Yetna \\\\nSchool, where they singled out Social Security as part of the \\\\nthree legs of the economic stool, and the only one that has \\\\nnever missed a payment, and I would dare say also has that \\\\ncompassion that you talked about.\\\\n    Commissioner, can you talk about what you have done so far \\\\nto address the customer service crisis? You did in your opening \\\\nremarks, but I wanted to give you a chance to expand on how you \\\\nwould use the 1.3 billion increase that President Biden has \\\\nproposed.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. We are currently in a general \\\\nhiring freeze in this agency. It is a crude tool. That tool \\\\nitself hurts our operations. And hopefully, with your help, we \\\\nwill get out of that soon in order to do a number of targeted \\\\nhires right away.\\\\n    I want to thank you for what is in the, you know, the most \\\\nrecent action passed by this Congress. That is a little bit of \\\\nhelp, and we need help. So it is a lot better than a cut, and I \\\\nknow cuts were on the table.\\\\n    So we do have a plan for immediate targeted hiring in those \\\\nteleservice centers, as well as some processing center \\\\nbacklogs, and especially the DDSs.\\\\n    But more to the point of your question, the 15.4 that the \\\\nPresident proposes, this is how we would propose to invest \\\\nthose dollars to improve customer service.\\\\n    Number one, 269 million into the field staff. Our field \\\\noffices have been open 5 days a week, from 9:00 to 4:00 p.m. \\\\nevery day, and that has been true ever since the end of COVID. \\\\nBut they are short-staffed, they are understaffed, and they are \\\\noverwhelmed.\\\\n    The teleservice centers, we would propose investing $79 \\\\nmillion in hiring more of the agents who can be on the other \\\\nend of that call. Not surprisingly, when somebody has been on \\\\nhold for an hour, they come off that call hot, and we right now \\\\nhave an attrition rate of about 24 percent in our teleservice \\\\ncenters. We would invest 85 million in adding staff to the \\\\nprocess centers, the processing centers that I am sure many of \\\\nyou get calls about people saying, hey, I was told my claim was \\\\napproved, but it has been months, been weeks, I am still \\\\nwaiting. That is what goes on at the processing centers.\\\\n    Eighty-nine million for the ALJ hearings. And the biggest \\\\namount of all is really the 2.8 billion for the state \\\\ndisability services. In my prepared remarks that are before \\\\nyou, there is a map that may look to you at first glance like \\\\nit is a climate change map, because the only colors on it are \\\\nyellow, orange, and red. There is nothing green, there is \\\\nnothing where we are actually hitting in a timely fashion those \\\\ninitial disability determinations. In the State of Montana, 85 \\\\npercent of their disability determination folks are trainees. \\\\nIt is a tough--it is a tough job. And some of our states have \\\\nseen a 30 percent, you know, reduction in staffing since--\\\\ncompared to pre-pandemic times.\\\\n    And then finally, 1.7 billion to invest in IT \\\\nmodernization. It might be a little known fact, but it has been \\\\ndriven home to me that in our IT budget, which is only about a \\\\nthird of the size of the VA--not to be jealous--but in our IT \\\\nbudget, 90 percent of it is from maintaining old legacy \\\\nsystems. Think, if you will, about the City of Jerusalem being \\\\nbuilt up over years, except this is COBOL and green screens. \\\\nOnly 10 percent of it goes to modernization.\\\\n    Mr. LARSON. And imagine you do that with 40 percent of the \\\\nnation who is on Social Security, knowing that is the only \\\\nbenefit that they have is their Social Security. And on \\\\naverage, that is 18,000 per male, 14,000 per female. And there \\\\nis 5 million fellow Americans that get below poverty-level \\\\nchecks in the wealthiest nation in the world.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Next I recognize Mr. LaHood.\\\\n    You are recognized for five minutes.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Thank you, Chairman Ferguson.\\\\n    And Commissioner, thanks for your opening statement. And \\\\nyou have obviously had a distinguished public service career. I \\\\nthink this may be your most challenging position you have had \\\\nyet, and we want you to be successful in this job, and I \\\\nappreciate your opening statement and talking about the need \\\\nfor improving customer service and workforce morale. That seems \\\\nessential. And so we want you to be successful there.\\\\n    I want to ask you about a couple of things here. As you may \\\\nbe aware, last June Congress passed the bipartisan Fiscal \\\\nResponsibility Act, and a key part of the FRA included the \\\\nequivalent of a PAYGO for agency rulemaking. It established a \\\\nnew requirement that, if the cost of a proposed rulemaking \\\\nexceeds $1 billion over 10 years, or $100 million in any given \\\\nyear, before the rule can be finalized the agency must either \\\\npropose to undertake one or more administrative actions to \\\\nreduce spending, or publish a waiver of such requirement by the \\\\nDirector of Office of Management and Budget, OMB.\\\\n    Now, I know you have only been on the job for four months \\\\nnow, equivalent, but in the past year SSA has published at \\\\nleast 3 proposed rules that exceed $1 billion in estimated \\\\ncost.\\\\n    Number one, the ``Omitting Food from In-Kind Support and \\\\nMaintenance Calculations&#x27;&#x27; proposed rule, with a cost of $1.5 \\\\nbillion; number two, the ``Expand the Definition of Public \\\\nAssistance Household&#x27;&#x27; proposed rule, with a cost of 15.9 \\\\nbillion; and three, the ``Intermediate Improvement to the \\\\nDisability Adjudication Process&#x27;&#x27; proposedrule, with a cost of \\\\n20.3 billion. SSA has indicated it plans to finalize these rules \\\\nsometime in 2024.\\\\n    So Commissioner, I guess my question is, does the SSA \\\\nintend to comply with the FRA and the clear requirements there, \\\\nand publish information regarding how the cost of these rules \\\\nwill be offset through other administrative regulatory actions?\\\\n    Or if not, will OMB be issuing a waiver for such \\\\nrequirements?\\\\n    If you could, address those three.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. And as I look through, Mr. \\\\nChairman, as I was listening and looking through my own list, I \\\\ndo believe that I was the commissioner that approved all three \\\\nof those.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. All right, even better.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. It wasn&#x27;t the last year, it was the last 60 \\\\ndays. And they will be published in due course, and we will, of \\\\ncourse, abide by the law of the land in terms of finding \\\\noffsets or asking for waivers.\\\\n    There is a few others, as well. You know, availability of \\\\ninformation and records to the public, social security numbers \\\\nand government records. Oh, the Payroll Information Exchange, \\\\nwhich we hope will go a long way to reducing overpayments, \\\\nespecially in SSI, that one is also in motion. And many of \\\\nthose will actually save us administratively.\\\\n    There is also the manner of appearings--appearance at \\\\nhearings, which I approved three nights ago, and there are the \\\\npayments to entities, what is called----\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. And Mr. Commissioner, I guess on the three \\\\nthat I mentioned, do you, as we sit here today, have a decision \\\\non whether you are going to seek the offset or whether you are \\\\ngoing to seek the waiver?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Well, we are still--we want to hear what \\\\npeople have to say after we publish them and get the--all of \\\\nthe necessary feedback.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Okay. The Work and Welfare Subcommittee \\\\nthat I chair also has jurisdiction over child welfare programs. \\\\nAnd we have been investigating an issue where state welfare \\\\nagencies act as ``representative payees&#x27;&#x27; for children in \\\\nfoster care who receive SSI or Social Security survivor \\\\nbenefits. Approximately 6 percent of children in foster care \\\\nreceive SSI or SB benefits.\\\\n    In 2018 the Strengthening Protections for Social Security \\\\nBeneficiaries Act called for the establishment of data \\\\nexchanges through SSA and state welfare agencies to increase \\\\ntransparency for youth receiving SSI and placed in foster \\\\nhomes. My understanding is 5 years later, only 22 states are \\\\nactively sharing data with SSA on their child welfare \\\\nrepresentative payees as part of these exchanges.\\\\n    Could you provide insights into SSA&#x27;s concrete strategy to \\\\nincentivize the remaining states to fully engage in the \\\\nrepresentative payee data exchange?\\\\n    And what does Congress need to do to make sure this is \\\\nimplemented as it was intended?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your question, \\\\nand thank you for your care and concern and compassion for our \\\\nkids who are in foster care and often times age out, and they \\\\nare given a pat on the back on their birthday and their clothes \\\\nin a plastic bag, and said good luck. And all of you know that \\\\nthe outcomes for kids that age out of foster care are pretty \\\\nbad, not surprisingly.\\\\n    I believe that we have an opportunity here with Social \\\\nSecurity, and especially as you look at the movement--I think \\\\nthere are 17 states that have now required that some amount of \\\\nmoney be conserved for kids in foster care for when they age \\\\nout, especially if they are, you know, receiving some sort of \\\\nbenefits.\\\\n    So we are now doing a deep dive on this issue. According to \\\\na GAO report about 2 years ago, 34 percent of states claimed \\\\nthat they conserved some money for the kids once they get to a \\\\nplace where they are aging out of foster care. We are going \\\\nback through those records, even as I speak. I would like to \\\\nreserve the opportunity to come back for you--to you for help \\\\nif there is a legislative--if there is a need for amending \\\\nstatutes.\\\\n    But we are looking at everything we might be able to do \\\\nourselves through rulemaking power or POMs so that we, in \\\\nessence, say to states, if you are going to be the \\\\nrepresentative payee for the--for this child, you have got to \\\\nassure us that you are going to conserve something so that kid \\\\ncan at least make a downpayment on an apartment, instead of \\\\nliving under a bridge, especially if we have the opportunity \\\\nbecause of Social Security benefits to be able to do that.\\\\n    It is not a practice, as you know, that has been deemed \\\\ncontrary to the law by the states to use that for support and \\\\nmaintenance, any more than it would be contrary to law for a \\\\ngrandmother or an aunt or uncle in care of a child to be able \\\\nto use those dollars for maintenance and support. However, I \\\\nthink it is different when we have a state government entity \\\\nthat can and should do better in partnership in our Federal \\\\nframework to do better by these kids, and we are going to be \\\\nissuing some notice of advance plan for rulemaking so we can \\\\nget some feedback.\\\\n    There is a lot of good work that has been done on this, and \\\\nI am hopeful that, with our existing powers, we can address \\\\nthis gap in our expectations of one another and how we should \\\\ndo right by these American kids.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. Well, in closing on that, Commissioner, I \\\\nmean, I think it is unacceptable that only 22 states are \\\\nsharing data on this issue right now. And so your statement \\\\nthat you want to work with us in Congress on how we make sure \\\\nthis is implemented as intended, we want to share suggestions \\\\nand ideas on that, but we got to remedy this situation.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Chairman LaHOOD. So I have one more question, but I will \\\\nsubmit that for the record so that others can ask questions. \\\\nThank you.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you. The gentleman from Illinois, \\\\nMr. Davis, is now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would request \\\\nunanimous consent to submit for the record a statement left by \\\\nMr. Kildee, who was unable to be here with us today.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Without objection.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6478A.015\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, \\\\nCommissioner.\\\\n    As you know, committee Democrats have made paid family and \\\\nmedical leave for all American workers a top priority. I am \\\\nparticularly concerned about the effect our failure to enact \\\\npaid leave has on people of color and lower-paid workers, who \\\\nare far less likely to get paid leave from their employers, and \\\\noften have to quit their jobs if they or someone in their \\\\nfamily gets sick.\\\\n    Would the President&#x27;s proposal for a universal, \\\\ncomprehensive paid leave provide 12 weeks of leave for lower-\\\\npaid workers and allow them to take leave when they need it \\\\ninstead of leaving the workforce?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. As I understand it, the President&#x27;s \\\\nproposal calls upon us to administer that program, and we \\\\nwould--and with the funding that is included in it we would \\\\ncertainly endeavor to do it. It is not right that we should be \\\\none of the most developed economies in the world, and yet one \\\\nof the very few that does not have paid family leave.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Many of our constituents rely on grandparents and extended \\\\nfamily networks. My understanding is that the President&#x27;s \\\\nproposal, like ours, would allow people to take leave to care \\\\nfor their chosen family. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir, it is. It is an acknowledgment of a \\\\ntruth that--I mean, we all know that that is the way it works. \\\\nI mean, grandparents, I think, at least in my city of \\\\nBaltimore, deserve a medal for what they do for their families \\\\nat great expense and great hardship often times.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much. Also, I extend my sincere \\\\nthanks for your attention to key concerns for me.\\\\n    First, I want to thank you for responding to the letter my \\\\ncolleagues and I sent about sickle cell disease quickly and \\\\nunderstandingly, how urgent the situation is for the families \\\\nwe represent. You indicated that the SSA will consult with \\\\nsickle cell experts in HHS.\\\\n    I also encourage you to draw on the medical expertise \\\\nwithin the Sickle Cell Disease Association, as well. Once your \\\\nstaff has reviewed the current criteria and consulted medical \\\\nexperts, could we schedule a time for all of us to hear the \\\\nresults and talk about next steps?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. Duly noted. And I absolutely will \\\\ncommit to that here and now.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you so much.\\\\n    And secondly, I am very pleased that you will examine how \\\\nSSA can better protect the benefits of foster youth to ensure \\\\nthat representative payees prioritize children&#x27;s needs, rather \\\\nthan state financial security. Both the Supreme Court and the \\\\nSSAB have indicated that the SSA commissioner has the authority \\\\nto determine if states reimbursing themselves for the cost of \\\\ncare violates their fiduciary responsibilities as \\\\nrepresentative payees. I am grateful for your leadership and \\\\ncommitment to foster youth.\\\\n    And finally, I want to thank you and the many members of \\\\nyour team for helping resolve issues facing my constituents, \\\\nincluding Lee Marsaglia, Tom Klouda, Eric Hansen, Joel Najar, \\\\nElizabeth Tino, and all the caseworkers in the West North \\\\nAvenue Chicago office. They have been incredible, and I want \\\\nyou to know that.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Davis. Next we are \\\\nhonored to have the Chairman of the full committee with us, the \\\\ngentleman from Missouri.\\\\n    Mr. Smith, you are recognized for your opening statement--\\\\nor excuse me.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. For questions?\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Questions, I am sorry.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chairman, for \\\\nhaving us.\\\\n    Commissioner O&#x27;Malley, thank you for taking time to be here \\\\nwith the best committee in Congress. So----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Thank you, and thank you for the time you \\\\ngave me in your office about a month ago.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Of course.\\\\n    In 2022 the Social Security Administration rescinded a \\\\npolicy that barred recovery of certain overpayments when the \\\\nSSA had failed to act on them for 10 years. In a message to its \\\\nemployees, the agency noted that it rescinded this policy \\\\nbecause it didn&#x27;t have the authority to bar recovery of those \\\\ndebts under the Social Security Act.\\\\n    In fiscal year 2022 alone, Social Security made $11 billion \\\\nin overpayments across the Social Security and Supplemental \\\\nSocial Security Income programs, 2 billion of which resulted \\\\nfrom the agency&#x27;s failure to use available data to avoid such \\\\nmistakes.\\\\n    Commissioner O&#x27;Malley, if Congress provides you with the \\\\nnecessary authority, do I have your assurance that you will \\\\nimplement it as quickly as possible so that more people are not \\\\npenalized for the SSA&#x27;s failure to act in a timely manner?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. And Mr. Chairman, would you be \\\\ntalking about that 10-year statute of limitations or \\\\nadministrative finality, whatever the proper parlance is here?\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. That is it, yes.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir, I would. In fact, we are examining \\\\nthat, even as we speak, as part of the other things that we are \\\\ndoing on overpayments.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Over the past year the SSA has published multiple proposed \\\\nrules, and taken administrative action independent of Congress \\\\nthat would obligate an estimated $40 billion of new mandatory \\\\nspending. Under what statutory authority do you believe that \\\\nyou can make these changes?\\\\n    And are there, in your view, any limits to that authority?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, certainly there is there \\\\nis limits within the law, and just a little while ago we were \\\\ntalking about some of those things.\\\\n    It is interesting. I meet on a regular, every-month basis \\\\nwith claimants&#x27; representatives, as well as advocates. And \\\\nespecially among the claimants&#x27; representatives, I mean, they \\\\nare people from all over the country, Democrats, Republicans \\\\nalike. And they have been waiting a long time for a confirmed \\\\ncommissioner that would put forward many of these regulations.\\\\n    One of them I know that you and I spoke about was PIE, the \\\\nPayroll Information Exchange, which could limit overpayments. \\\\nSo that one is now moving. Social Security numbers and \\\\ngovernment records, the--and the rental subsidy policy for SSI \\\\nrecipients.\\\\n    Now, all of those have a--all of those have a bit of a \\\\nprice tag. Some of them come out of the trust fund, and I would \\\\nargue--or submit to you, rather--that those have already been \\\\npaid for by and don&#x27;t contribute to the debt because they have \\\\nbeen paid for by the people that have paid into Social \\\\nSecurity. Others, where SSI is concerned, will have a cost, but \\\\nthere will also be some administrative savings.\\\\n    Now, having said all of that, we still have to publish \\\\nthese. We still have to get, you know, public comment back on \\\\nthese. But there has been a lot of thought and a lot of \\\\ndeliberation on these. I don&#x27;t want you to think for a second \\\\nthat all of a sudden, you know, we just started rubber-stamping \\\\na bunch of these and sending them through the door. They have \\\\nbeen stuck at Social Security in some cases for years, and I \\\\nhope it will make the program better and improve our customer \\\\nservice and the purpose of the Act, and I think your \\\\ncongressional intent, which is to serve people who are in need \\\\nin better and faster and more timely and accurate ways.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Commissioner.\\\\n    Thank you, Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you. Next we will recognize the \\\\ncheerful and happiest man in Congress, a former fellow mayor, \\\\nand the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pascrell.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a wonderful \\\\nday in the neighborhood today. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Good to see another mayor.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Good to see you, Mayor.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Social Security is like a priceless heirloom \\\\nin a family, but not one fully maintained. There is a backlog. \\\\nIn fact, 2024 is going to be worse than 2023, projected, in \\\\nterms of folks that are working to bring service to people. You \\\\nare getting 12,000 beneficiaries every week, new ones.\\\\n    So regardless of how you slice it, there are many on both \\\\nsides of the aisle who understand it, have studied it, and \\\\nthink we need to do something different.\\\\n    The former President of the United States doesn&#x27;t think we \\\\nshould do very much different. His answer is we need more \\\\ncutting in Social Security. He says it. He doesn&#x27;t hide it. We \\\\nhave a clear choice about Social Security right now. You didn&#x27;t \\\\nsay it, I didn&#x27;t say it. That form of President said it. He \\\\ncontinues to say it. So the delays of 218, 225 days are not \\\\ngoing to be reduced very much if we continue the path where we \\\\nare.\\\\n    I was the first Member of Congress to ask that this \\\\nAdministration remove the failed predecessor in your job. He \\\\nwas appointed by the former President.\\\\n    Tens of millions of Americans rely on Social Security for \\\\ntheir lives. Yet between 2018--excuse me, 2019 and 2023, the \\\\nwait time rose 86 percent. Who speaks for thesepeople? Have \\\\nthey no spokesperson? Who speaks for people old like myself? If you \\\\ndon&#x27;t, don&#x27;t think any of us are going to jump up.\\\\n    How do we ratchet up SSA&#x27;s volume of disability case \\\\nreviews for Americans receiving disability insurance and \\\\nSupplemental Security Income?\\\\n    Commissioner, yesterday the study committee of our brothers \\\\nand sisters on the other side made up of 80 percent of \\\\ncolleagues across the aisle called for increasing the \\\\nretirement age, now tying it to life expectancy. I do not know \\\\nabout you, but I do not think Americans should be forced to \\\\nwork until they drop dead. Can you give us your thoughts on the \\\\ndangerous proposal?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, the--you know, the \\\\nbeautiful thing about this program is that 80 percent of \\\\nAmericans support it, regardless of party, and they want their \\\\ngovernment to strengthen it and expand it, not to cut it, \\\\ncontract it, or gut its customer service. I think that is a \\\\nphenomenal consensus in a time of polarized politics, that 80 \\\\npercent of the American people want us to expand it.\\\\n    To those who--for those who would advocate, you know, \\\\nraising the age, I think we have to be mindful of people that \\\\nreally do hard work, hard labor their whole lives, and who die \\\\nsooner than those of us that are privileged enough to be able \\\\nto, you know, do work that is not as, you know, taxing on our \\\\nbodies and our physical well-being.\\\\n    So I have never supported that myself. Your job is the \\\\npolicy-maker, and every day I have to remind myself that my job \\\\nis to improve customer service and leave the policy to you. But \\\\nI also can&#x27;t deny that once upon a time, before I got promoted, \\\\nI was in elective office and I used to run for office, but I \\\\nnever advocated those sorts of policies.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, can I ask a question without \\\\ngetting an answer? I just want to let it hang out there. \\\\n[Laughter.]\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Is that all right with your approval?\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. I hope I am not going to regret this. \\\\n[Laughter.]\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. No, you won&#x27;t regret it.\\\\n    We all have a fascination with the nation of immigrants. \\\\nWhat is SSA doing to ensure we do not block access to \\\\ndisability assistance for certain non-English speakers?\\\\n    The whole issue of immigration in Social Security, and \\\\nwhere we would be without the immigrants getting into the \\\\nsystem is one which I think--you need to address clarity.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. My dear friend----\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON [continuing]. I let you ask the question. \\\\nI didn&#x27;t know you were going to preach a sermon.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. So with that I will turn to my colleague \\\\nfrom Ohio. We are going to go to two to one here.\\\\n    So, Mr. Carey, you are now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Thank you, Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you, Commissioner, for being here today. I am going \\\\nto focus my questions on overpayments, so if you wanted to get \\\\nyour notes for that.\\\\n    Commissioner, I was disturbed to learn that there are \\\\npeople who are getting notices demanding tens of thousands of \\\\ndollars for overpayments that went unnoticed by SSA for years. \\\\nOn December 13 I sent a letter with my colleague, Emilia Sykes \\\\nfrom Akron, and five other Ohioans requesting information on \\\\nhow SSA processes improper payments, including overpayments.\\\\n    I was made aware right before this hearing--in fact, I \\\\nbelieve the time stamped was 1:55 that I did finally get a \\\\nresponse from your office. I will have time to read through \\\\nthat response later today. But I do have a couple questions for \\\\nyou.\\\\n    How much time, on average, does it take for SSA to \\\\ndetermine an overpayment has occurred after a person has \\\\nactually received the funds?\\\\n    And is there any limit on how long SSA has to establish the \\\\ndebt after the actual overpayment has occurred?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Let me answer--let me break down. Those are \\\\ntwo questions.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Right.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. With regard--let me back up a second.\\\\n    Beginning February 5 we began a process of looking for one \\\\nhour every two weeks at what we can do to untangle this Gordian \\\\nknot of the overpayments. That review actually, fortunately for \\\\nmy service, began in October, right around the same time as \\\\nthat 60 Minutes expose that showed those stories of those \\\\nAmericans who, through no fault of their own, had 100 percent \\\\nof their benefits intercepted and caused them a horrible \\\\nfinancial calamity.\\\\n    So there are several things that we have already done, and \\\\nthere are more things that we are doing. One of the things we \\\\nhave done is we have ended, as of March 25, the process of \\\\nintercepting 100 percent of benefits if the person doesn&#x27;t, you \\\\nknow, respond to the notice.\\\\n    Second, we are going to shift the burden away from asking \\\\nthe claimant to prove they weren&#x27;t at fault. That should be on \\\\nthe agency.\\\\n    Third, we are going to allow repayment plans instead of \\\\njust within the next 36 months. Instead, 60 months to alleviate \\\\nthe burden.\\\\n    And finally, we are going to make it easier for overpaid \\\\nbeneficiaries to request a waiver of repayment.\\\\n    The answer to the first part of your question, how long \\\\ndoes it take us to discover it, is the product of two things. \\\\nIt depends on what the nature of the overpayment was, and it \\\\nalso depends partly on the staffing that we have available.\\\\n    I have talked about the----\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Real quick----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY [continuing]. Staffing being----\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Commissioner, real quick.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY [continuing]. Because my time is going to run \\\\nout. So just in the case--except in the cases of fraud and \\\\nother fault on the part of a beneficiary, do you think it is \\\\nreasonable to surprise folks with recovering notices for old \\\\ndebts because it took the SSA too long to identify them?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. No sir, I don&#x27;t. But the length of time that \\\\nit takes us to discover it is a product of staffing being at \\\\n27-year lows.\\\\n    In other words, I don&#x27;t believe--we don&#x27;t believe, from the \\\\nstudying we have done for the last four months, that there is \\\\nmore errors--in other words, more overpayments. But we can \\\\nclearly see that the average amount of those payments has gone \\\\nup because it takes us longer to discover them.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. And on average, how many people are receiving \\\\nthese overpayments?\\\\n    I know we had a discrepancy in the last time I asked that \\\\nquestion, so I figured you came prepared to give a correct----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY [continuing]. Answer on that.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. We are better now. There are, to \\\\nthe best of our knowledge, information, and belief, there are--\\\\nover the fiscal years 2019 to fiscal year 2023--I will just \\\\ngive you 2019 and 2023.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. So total unique individuals in title 2 was \\\\n990,821. In fiscal year 2023 it was 986,912.\\\\n    In terms of SSI overpayment individuals--and keep in mind, \\\\nthis is, like, every month they have to prove how much they \\\\nhave earned, and that sort of thing, or send in their pay \\\\nstubs--in fiscal year 2019 it was 1,375,000. In fiscal year \\\\n2023 it was one 1,310,000.\\\\n    But as I said, what we saw was that, because of staffing \\\\nbeing at a 27-year low, it takes us longer to catch up with \\\\nthose overpayments when we discover them.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Thank--Commissioner, my time has expired.\\\\n    And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Carey. The gentleman from \\\\nArizona is now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Commissioner, Governor I actually think you have one of \\\\nthe most interesting jobs. I have always been fascinated with \\\\nthe math. So let&#x27;s bang through some of these real quick so we \\\\nhave a couple of moments for actual--some conversation.\\\\n    Would you consider--there is a program called Ticket to \\\\nWork.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It was always meant to be somewhat \\\\noptimistic. And is there a chance of moving whoever leads that \\\\ninto sort of your management cabinet so it gets more focus, \\\\nmore attention, and maybe more use?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir, perhaps. I am on a steep learning \\\\ncurve. And one of the things that I have learned, though, is \\\\nthat when it comes to Ticket to Work, it is a well-intended \\\\nprogram, but it is a program that we have not promoted.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It is almost exactly the point, is how do \\\\nwe make it meet its mission? Because it is something that had \\\\nboth left and right support, so----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, it is two things. It is not only \\\\npromoting the program, it is not only educating our front-line \\\\nstaff about it. There is probably some changes necessary so the \\\\nENs, the Employment Networks, are able to submit on behalf of \\\\nthird parties--I mean as a third party, those payment \\\\nverifications.\\\\n    But it also, as I understand it so far--I could be wrong--\\\\nsometimes in big bureaucracies people tell you one thing, and \\\\nwhen you ask five more whys, you find out another.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Why does that sound so familiar?\\\\n    But look, you have our interest. So----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. It requires, I think, some more staffing as--\\\\nin addition to just, you know, printing up more fliers and \\\\npushing out more notice.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. As time goes on, if one of your senior \\\\nstaff would ever be willing to communicate with us, we would \\\\nlike to sort of understand it better.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, I would like to get back to you in short \\\\norder on that.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Second, several months ago I think we had \\\\none of the Social Security actuaries with us, and there was a \\\\ncomment made that is burned in my head, and that was when we \\\\nget to expiration of the trust fund in, what is it, 8 or 9 \\\\nfiscal years, that the commissioner may have authority to say, \\\\nokay, high-income earners, you get a 40 percent cut, low-income \\\\nearners, you only get a 5 percent cut.\\\\n    Have you ever had response from your legal staff on an \\\\nopinion whether you have that authority?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. I haven&#x27;t, I have not had that opinion from \\\\nthem. I had one U.S. Senator tell me that in the Social \\\\nSecurity commissioner&#x27;s office drawer there is a whole bunch of \\\\nmagic wands. I can assure you I looked in that drawer. There \\\\nwere no magic wands.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. But at some point I want to make sure, if \\\\nyou have that authority, then we need to work with you. If you \\\\ndon&#x27;t have the authority, we have to try to not obfuscate our \\\\nown responsibilities.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. I will inquire more deeply.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Can I talk a little bit? I don&#x27;t want to take \\\\nyour time.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Well, I want to hit on----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT [continuing]. One other. If you ever have a \\\\nconversation with the IRS commissioner----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, frequently.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT [continuing]. They did an experiment last \\\\nyear, a small one, and it was kept fairly quiet. But it was \\\\nusing a chat AI for answering the phones, providing service. \\\\nEarly data on that, it was remarkably accepted and functional. \\\\nThey are expanding it this year.\\\\n    There may be a learning curve there, because if part of \\\\nyour backup is the inbound phone calls, the ability to adopt \\\\ntechnology--because, let&#x27;s be honest, hiring people in--when \\\\nyou see our labor force structure, is hard and difficult. So \\\\nplease consider that as a backbone.\\\\n    One of the other things I would like to make--because \\\\noriginally I was going to say some very snarky things; I bit my \\\\ntongue because this is too important--I would love a moment \\\\nwhere, you know, one of my friends here from, I believe it is \\\\nConnecticut, cares deeply about Social Security. I am fixated \\\\non the math. Obviously, it is your--could we ever bring in your \\\\nactuaries, my PhD economists from the Joint Economic Committee? \\\\nBecause we had a couple of--our smartest team spent months, it \\\\ntook months because of how hard it is to get responses and \\\\nactuarial data from your actuaries, from our own folks on our \\\\nside because population data, retirement data, labor force \\\\nparticipation, there is all sorts of things that go on here.\\\\n    But my fear is we don&#x27;t tell the truth about the math. We \\\\nuse 2034 as our date, and I have actually done multiple floor \\\\nspeeches on this. We actually have the actual total shortfall \\\\nby--if you tax--raise the cap $400,000 and up, just remove it, \\\\nyou still have a $417 billion shortfall in the 1 year. So \\\\nremember, the first year of shortfall is $616 billion short. \\\\nAnd raising the cap takes care of 358, and then you lose \\\\nanother 59 in general fund revenues. So you have an over $400 \\\\nbillion shortfall. Getting rid of the cap completely, you still \\\\nhave another well over $300 billion shortfall.\\\\n    Why the morality of this I am so concerned about is it is a \\\\ngreat political issue. It will be, as your own actuary said, we \\\\ndouble senior poverty the day the trust fund is emptied.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. And the solutions we give here are only \\\\ncovering about a third of the shortfall. We are going to have \\\\nto have some very uncomfortable conversations, both the left \\\\nand the right, to make this math work.\\\\n    With that, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. LARSON. I think a vote would be good.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman----\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Maybe a vote on math that is actually real.\\\\n    Mr. LARSON. And on people associated with the math.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. We will--let&#x27;s--gentlemen, both--if you \\\\nall want to have that discussion in the back room, go ahead. We \\\\nare going to continue on, and the gentlelady from California, \\\\nMs. Chu, is now recognized.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Commissioner O&#x27;Malley, thank you for being here.\\\\n    One of my top priorities on this committee is improving \\\\noutcomes for children and youth in the foster care system, as \\\\nwe know that without appropriate documentation, including \\\\nSocial Security cards, foster youth transitioning out of care \\\\ncan&#x27;t travel, secure employment, obtain housing, or continue \\\\ntheir education. I have heard from foster youth about this, and \\\\nI have also heard from the LA County Department of Children and \\\\nFamily Services.\\\\n    So in January of last year, I sent a letter to the \\\\nAdministration detailing these challenges faced when the foster \\\\nyouth are trying to secure Social Security cards. These \\\\nchallenges stemmed from differences in the Social Security \\\\nAdministration&#x27;s regional enforcement of the agency&#x27;s document \\\\nrequirement policies. For example, regional SSA offices appear \\\\nto be using inconsistent application approval procedures, \\\\nincluding for what they consider acceptable documents for \\\\nSocial Security card requests for children and foster youth.\\\\n    I do appreciate that the Administration responded to this \\\\nletter to let me know that they had contacted LA County and \\\\nlocal Social Security field offices about the concern, but I \\\\nunderstand that challenges remain. So can you talk about what \\\\nSSA is doing to ensure that foster youth can smoothly and \\\\nreliably secure their Social Security cards?\\\\n    Are there ways that Congress can help you improve this \\\\nprocess?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Congresswoman, thank you for your question, \\\\nthank you for your letter, and also thank you for your concern \\\\nin fighting for kids in foster care. As a former mayor of \\\\nBaltimore and a former governor, I have spent a fair amount of \\\\neffort and time trying to do better by kids as they age out of \\\\nfoster care. And sadly, I saw a lot of the similarities to \\\\nreentry programs in another context, although in this context \\\\nit is kids who are reentering and, we hope, a life of \\\\nindependence outside of foster care.\\\\n    There is a couple of things we need to do much better as an \\\\nagency. There are many things we need to do much better, I \\\\nshould say. And we are discovering some of those.\\\\n    Training really took a hit during COVID, and we haven&#x27;t \\\\nrecovered from it since. So we do find disparate, different \\\\napplications of our rules, depending on what region you are in, \\\\nand even from one field office to another. So we have to \\\\nimprove on our training.\\\\n    Secondly we have been slow--in our aversion to risk and our \\\\nduty to safeguard the program, we have been slow to embrace \\\\nsome technologies that Americans take for granted everywhere, \\\\nlike electronic signatures or state records that are e-\\\\ncertified. There are many things we need to do to ease the \\\\ntraditional requirements of paper documents in order to make \\\\nsure that people--in this case, foster kids--have what they \\\\nneed from the agency so that they can be successful in moving \\\\nforward.\\\\n    The most important thing you could do, the most important \\\\nthing you could do for the agency is to pass the President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget. It would be a solid step in the right direction.\\\\n    And to the gentleman who was talking about the Social \\\\nSecurity Trust Fund and the longer term, we need to get back to \\\\noperating on 1.2 percent of our annual benefit outlays. That \\\\nwas the way it was in 2018, 2017, 2016, and going back. But now \\\\nwe are down to less than one percent. And for those of you that \\\\nare concerned about what this does to the trust fund and the \\\\n2034 depletion event, bringing Social Security funding back up \\\\nto the traditional 1.2 percent would only advance that \\\\ndepletion event by 30 days.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Well, I hope that you will monitor the situation, \\\\nthat we can stay in touch on this issue in terms of \\\\nimprovements made, because these are the most vulnerable kids \\\\nwho really need that help.\\\\n    And I did want to ask about the 2024-2025 President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget request, because I am very disturbed by these 38 minutes \\\\nthat you are on hold for the 800 system and the 8 months that \\\\ndisability applicants are waiting on average. And we know that \\\\nit made a big difference when we gave funds to the IRS to \\\\nimprove their services. And what would be the major thing that \\\\nyou think would improve if the President&#x27;s budget was approved?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. The major thing would be our ability to hire \\\\nagents and train the agents so that they can answer those \\\\ncalls. We are suffering from a 24 percent attrition rate in our \\\\nteleservice centers. We have some work to do ourselves. The \\\\ncontractor on our phone system needs to deliver what has been \\\\npromised.\\\\n    But the most important thing in that President&#x27;s budget is \\\\nthe ability to hire more teleservice centers. And we are \\\\ngetting--and we are anxious to do that. These folks are like \\\\nthe Tuskegee Airmen, you know, they are character without any \\\\nrecognition for them to hang in there answering call after call \\\\nof really angry, impatient people, and then deal patiently with \\\\nthem.\\\\n    I visited all nine regions of the country in my first month \\\\non this job, and I would listen for 40 minutes or an hour on \\\\nthe other, you know, on whatever you call it, the copilot \\\\nheadset next to these teleservice centers. Man, they are my \\\\nheroes, and we need to do better by them. They are overwhelmed, \\\\nstressed out, and--but still, every day they are trying to make \\\\nit work. Hiring more teleservice centers people is $79 million \\\\nof that President&#x27;s budget--of the President&#x27;s proposed budget.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you. The gentleman from the great \\\\nState of Utah, Mr. Moore, you are now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you to all \\\\nthe chairmen and to all the ranking members that we have here \\\\ntoday for holding this hearing. We appreciate it.\\\\n    This is, you know, not the attention-getting stuff that you \\\\nwill see on the evening news tonight about this work when we \\\\ntalk actuaries, we talk Social Security. This is what matters \\\\nto virtually every American. This is what matters, and we have \\\\nto get this right.\\\\n    I represent the 1st district of Utah, and it is one of the \\\\nlarger processing centers for the IRS, and I have, you know, in \\\\nthis committee have gotten to get even closer to that work, and \\\\nheard from them, had a chance to talk to the commissioner from \\\\nthe IRS, as well. And I think there is a strong correlation, \\\\njust like my colleague from Arizona mentioned, about the need \\\\nto modernize. And so I wanted to talk a little bit about that.\\\\n    But first, I appreciate your comments on the foster care \\\\nadoption, and seeing these kids time out. These aren&#x27;t just two \\\\nto three percentage points that go into homelessness or drug \\\\naddiction. This is--these kids turn 18, 19, this is massive \\\\npercentages. And so I appreciate the chairman for the Work and \\\\nWelfare Subcommittee for focusing on that.\\\\n    I have something for the record, Chairman, a letter from \\\\nMr. David Camp, CEO of the National Organization of Social \\\\nSecurity Claimants&#x27; Representatives to this committee that \\\\ndetails the efficiencies that we have already seen simply by \\\\nallowing for digital sharing of information between \\\\nrepresentatives and claimants.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. So ordered.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you.\\\\n    Despite spending more than a decade and $300 million \\\\nthrough its Occupational Requirements Survey to procure updated \\\\njobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the SSA is still \\\\nusing a Dictionary of Occupational Titles from 1977. That was \\\\nlast partially updated over 30 years ago to make disability \\\\ndeterminations.\\\\n    At a hearing in October we heard how the use of the \\\\nDictionary of Occupational Titles, DOT, disadvantages some who \\\\nare truly disabled and advantages others who may be able to \\\\nwork because it includes outdated job listings like a \\\\nphonograph cartridge assembler but, unlike the ORS, it doesn&#x27;t \\\\ninclude jobs like a web developer, right? We have modernized \\\\nsince the 1970s, right?\\\\n    And can you help me understand why this updated data hasn&#x27;t \\\\nbeen used, and why the SSA still relies on the outdated DOT, \\\\nwhich contains job listings that haven&#x27;t existed in our economy \\\\nfor decades?\\\\n    Or if you can enlighten us with improvements in this area, \\\\nI would be totally interested.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. As you might imagine, given our \\\\nbudget straits and the lowest staffing we have had in 27 years, \\\\nto look at spending more money on a program that has already \\\\nspent a lot of money and no result, I had to, in good \\\\nconscience, put the brakes on that for right now.\\\\n    And I am taking a second look at it, doing a deeper dive. \\\\nIt is my understanding that this contract is extremely labor \\\\nintensive, and it is also my understanding that any change to \\\\nthe DOT will create different winners and losers, as any policy \\\\nchoice will in a program.\\\\n    So Congressman, I haven&#x27;t entirely figured it out myself, \\\\nbut it is a great source of embarrassment for this agency to \\\\nbe, you know, asked why it is that we still have seal killers \\\\nand nut sorters and phonograph cartridge makers as occupations \\\\nwhen they haven&#x27;t been here for a long time. We should, at the \\\\nvery least, start removing those obsolete jobs from the list, \\\\nand I think perhaps there is something we can learn from other \\\\nadvanced and developed nations as to how they stay in touch \\\\nwith a rapidly changing economy.\\\\n    And the OIS is certainly another alternative.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. I think there is some really productive \\\\nliterature out there. It is my understanding this is mostly \\\\npaid for, and I think there is a--to have the will, we can find \\\\nthe way on this.\\\\n    I experienced it in my own family. I have a young boy who \\\\nis eight years old. He is going to have a different path in \\\\nlife. I know he is going to be a contributing member. He is \\\\ngoing to find a job that works for him, right? And he is going \\\\nto have challenges up until that point, but he is going to find \\\\na lane. And I want to make sure we are doing what we can to \\\\nstrip out arbitrary, you know, useless data and modernized with \\\\nthis.\\\\n    AEI has a great book, American Renewal, that has a whole \\\\nchapter on what can be used and what can be done to this to \\\\nenhance what we can get out of our population and our \\\\ncommunities right now, because there is a whole group of people \\\\nthat want to work, that want to contribute. And I am confident \\\\nwe can do much better in this.\\\\n    I won&#x27;t have time to be able to dig into the top ten legacy \\\\nsystems, but consider our office an office that will dig into \\\\nthis as much as possible. It works for--it is important for my \\\\ndistrict for the IRS to be able to modernize their \\\\ntechnologies.\\\\n    And, you know, as we have mentioned earlier, the same could \\\\ngo, and we can use these--we improve people&#x27;s work experience \\\\nby investing in these technologies to make their job \\\\nsatisfaction go up. You get better productivity out of them, \\\\nand we will see better hiring come from this type of stuff. So \\\\nI encourage you to push as much as possible on this.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Congressman, thank you. I totally agree with \\\\nyou, and I would really like to work with you.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. The gentlelady from California, Mrs. \\\\nSteel, is recognized.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you for coming, Commissioner. This is just my \\\\nstatement. And you know what? I have been hearing just so much \\\\nfrom you, low staffing, and then, you know, you need more \\\\nstaffing. But actually, Social Security Administration is \\\\nspending $1.7 billion for information technology services to \\\\nmaintain and modernizing IT infrastructure, as well as digital \\\\nand automated services. So if you can add that, I don&#x27;t think \\\\nyou should ask more staffing and you have the way too low \\\\nstaffing. Having said that, I am not asking you about that \\\\nanswer. But you know what? You really have to go back and \\\\nstudy.\\\\n    Social Security improper payments, many of which occur by \\\\nno fault of those who have been improperly paid, place a heavy \\\\nburden on the recipients who often face the difficult and time \\\\nintensive process to resolve the issue with the Social Security \\\\nAdministration. So overpayment also cost taxpayers billions and \\\\ntake valuable resources away from the Social Security \\\\nAdministration that could be used for other purposes.\\\\n    So nine years ago that--actually, Congress authorized that \\\\npayroll information exchange you just briefly mentioned, and \\\\nChairman Smith was asking, and then you answered that it is \\\\nmoving. So I just need really quick--I have just one more \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    So it has been launched, when, and what is the result, and \\\\nhow this PIE is going, and which direction?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, the Payroll Information Exchange, the \\\\nregs for that will be published this April. But depending upon \\\\nthe comments back, we hope to be able to implement it in July.\\\\n    We have had to move money out of that IT budget because 90 \\\\npercent of that IT budget goes to tape together old legacy \\\\nsystems: COBOL, green screen. But with a new CIO from \\\\nCalifornia, we are moving around dollars in order to implement \\\\nPIE. And we have already done a lot of the pre-testing work on \\\\nit in anticipation of these regulations. And so, fingers \\\\ncrossed, I would look forward to that being in use by the end \\\\nof this summer.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Well, you know what? You are bringing CIO from \\\\nCalifornia. When we do exactly opposite of what California \\\\ngovernment does, we are very successful. I love California, I \\\\nlove the weather, and I want to save California. That is the \\\\nreason that I am staying there.\\\\n    Another leading cause of overpayment in the SSI program is \\\\nundisclosed financial accounts. To address this, SSA \\\\nimplemented the Access to Financial Institutions program in \\\\n2011. AFI helps the SSA verify bank account balances when \\\\nprocessing SSI applicants.\\\\n    Currently, SSA examines any bank accounts where the \\\\nreported balance is over $400, but initiated a study to explore \\\\nreducing this threshold to 0. This study was put on hold during \\\\nCOVID. In 2022, SSA Office of Inspector General recommended \\\\nthat SSA agree to revisit this study in 2023.\\\\n    Have you revisited this study, and do you have the result \\\\nto share with the committee?\\\\n    Will the SSA be reducing the AFI threshold to zero and use \\\\nit for every SSI applicant to further reduce burdensome, \\\\nimproper payment to SSI recipients?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Congresswoman, I am on a steep learning \\\\ncurve, and I am learning something new every day. One of the \\\\nthings I have learned about SSI is that, while it is only about \\\\n4 percent of our benefits, it is about 38 percent of our \\\\nadministrative costs. I am not specifically aware of any \\\\nresults of that study to change that COVID-era rule, but I \\\\nwould ask your permission to look into that and get you a \\\\nproper answer promptly.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. I would love to get that. Thank you very much \\\\nfor----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Thank you.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL [continuing]. Coming to the hearing today.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you. The gentlelady from \\\\nCalifornia, Ms. Sanchez, you are now recognized.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And I want to welcome you, Commissioner O&#x27;Malley. Thank you \\\\nso much for your time today.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Social security is really vital to our \\\\nnation&#x27;s economy, and I have been a member that has \\\\nconsistently supported increased funding for Social Security, \\\\nwhich is more than I can say for some of my colleagues on this \\\\ndais.\\\\n    In fact, just yesterday, the Republican Study Committee \\\\nreleased their budget proposal, which included even more \\\\naggressive cuts to Social Security, suggesting a $1.5 trillion \\\\nreduction over the next decade. And as you stated, \\\\nCommissioner, years of underfunding have already eroded SSA&#x27;s \\\\ncustomer service and other basic operations. After accounting \\\\nfor inflation, SSA&#x27;s funding for basic operations has fallen by \\\\napproximately 17 percent and, as a result, SSA has lost roughly \\\\n10,500 full-time workers over the past decade.\\\\n    In my district there is an SSA Office of Hearing \\\\nOperations, and some of my constituents that are employed there \\\\nrecently shared some stories about the difficulties of \\\\nunderstaffing, and they outlined an agency-wide issue. And \\\\nwhile I appreciate your encouragement of the hard-working folks \\\\nwho are serving their country as SSA employees, I think we can \\\\nall agree that these employees deserve to be paid a decent wage \\\\nand to be fully staffed.\\\\n    Commissioner O&#x27;Malley, what can Congress do to help ensure \\\\nthat SSA can restore not only strong customer service, but \\\\nadequate staffing for field and hearing operations offices?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Congresswoman, thank you for your question. \\\\nThank you for your concern for Social Security.\\\\n    Your numbers are spot on. We are dealing--we are serving \\\\nmore beneficiaries than ever. During COVID we saw a slight dip \\\\nin disability applications. But now, for the last three years, \\\\ndisability applications are going back up, as well. And as you \\\\nknow, if a person is denied, they go to the next level of \\\\nhearing and in the hearing offices.\\\\n    There are some bright spots in all of this. I think it was \\\\nArnold Toynbee that said that man progresses--and he meant men \\\\nand women--progress in response to adversity. And certainly, \\\\nCOVID was a lot of adversity for the office of--what we call \\\\nthe Office of Administrative Hearings. We have shifted to doing \\\\nhearings by teleconference and also video, something that was a \\\\nnecessity during COVID. But now that we have come out of COVID, \\\\nwe find that most of the claimants, 70 percent of whom are \\\\nrepresented, prefer the teleconference and prefer the video.\\\\n    Having said all of that, there is nothing more important \\\\nthat you could do for those employees than to restore a level \\\\nof adequate funding that this agency was able to spend for \\\\nevery year prior to 2018. We operated on 1.2 percent of our \\\\noverhead more efficiently and more effectively than any other \\\\ninsurance corporation on the planet. And yet we have now been \\\\ncut.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. I mean, and I don&#x27;t pretend--Mr. Chairman, I \\\\ndon&#x27;t think it was intentional by Congress. But in nine years \\\\nwe haven&#x27;t even had a budget or appropriations hearing.\\\\n    And the good news is--I think it is good news--is that \\\\nbecause the customer service is funded out of the same dollars \\\\npeople have already paid for benefits, this doesn&#x27;t add to the \\\\nFederal debt.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. It is there. You can&#x27;t tell people, oh, we \\\\nhave got your benefits, and eventually, by 2034, we are going \\\\nto create another long-term fix, but in the meantime we are \\\\ngoing to allow your customer service to be cut.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. I truly believe that, if you are able to \\\\nsupport the President&#x27;s budget for restoring staffing and \\\\neventually getting us back up to our traditional 1.2 percent, \\\\nyou are not only going to restore trust in this agency&#x27;s \\\\ncustomer service, you are going to restore a lot of trust in \\\\nthe ability of the Republic to serve its people.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Yes, I have a question about the President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget, but I hope my colleagues will heed your warning and \\\\njoin me in calling for an increased Social Security budget for \\\\nfiscal year 2025 and beyond.\\\\n    I appreciate your commitment to trying to get Social \\\\nSecurity back on track. And I know that you and President Biden \\\\nare aiming to address the devastating staffing shortages which \\\\naffect not only those who rely on Social Security, but the \\\\nworkers who help provide those benefits.\\\\n    I want to say that President Biden&#x27;s budget proposal \\\\nincludes 12 weeks of universal, comprehensive, paid family and \\\\nmedical leave, like the proposal that we passed out of this \\\\ncommittee in Build Back Better in 2021. At that time, every \\\\nsingle Ways and Means Republican voted against a paid leave \\\\nplan for workers. But paid leave is really vital to working \\\\nAmericans. And as a mother myself, I know how difficult it can \\\\nbe to balance parenting and a demanding job.\\\\n    I just want to ask, Commissioner O&#x27;Malley--and I will take \\\\nyour response in writing, it doesn&#x27;t have to be verbal right \\\\nnow--but do you consider universal paid leave a critical \\\\nfeature of that plan?\\\\n    And again, I will take your answer in writing after. Thank \\\\nyou.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. And I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. I thank the gentlelady.\\\\n    The gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Feenstra, you are now \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Thank you Mr. O&#x27;Malley, for being here today. I greatly \\\\nappreciate it. I see you were a mayor of Baltimore, a lot of \\\\nmoving parts when you do that. I was a city administrator, so--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. What city?\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. A small community in Iowa, Hull. So----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Where is that?\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. In the northwest corner. But----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. I have probably been there.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Yes, you probably have. It is--and those jobs \\\\nis where the rubber hits the road, and that is what I want to \\\\ntalk about today.\\\\n    You are a trustee, and so you are in charge of providing \\\\nCongress with an accurate financial picture of the health of \\\\nour Social Security Trust Fund. We all know that in 8 to 10 \\\\nyears, you know, there is going to be a catastrophic cliff that \\\\nis going to happen in that Social Security recipients, if we \\\\ndon&#x27;t do anything, could see an up to a 30 percent reduction in \\\\ntheir Social Security. And that is coming, I think, from your \\\\noffice.\\\\n    How can we tell and advise government and people that, hey, \\\\nthis is real. I mean, this isn&#x27;t something that is made up. I \\\\nmean, I worry about this immensely. And I think you and \\\\nCongress have to do our part to change this dynamic. And I just \\\\nwant your thoughts on that.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir, thank you. And I think there is \\\\nprobably nothing that gets quite as many eyeballs on \\\\npublications on the Internet as the screaming headlines that \\\\nsay your Social Security is about to go away in a few years, \\\\nespecially given the fact that 50 percent--for 50 percent of \\\\nseniors, that is the difference between poverty and----\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY [continuing]. And living in dignity.\\\\n    The good news is, you know, the governance to choose. And I \\\\nbelieve that we have the ability to extend solvency for the \\\\nforeseeable future, just like Tip O&#x27;Neill and Ronald Reagan and \\\\nHoward Baker did back in 1982. People remember that \\\\nnostalgically, as if Tip O&#x27;Neill and Ronald Reagan had a beer \\\\nand decided to fix it. But it was only up on the deadline.\\\\n    I don&#x27;t think we should wait until the deadline. I have had \\\\na lot of great conversations with people of both sides of the \\\\naisle, including Senator Cassidy on the other side of the Hill, \\\\nand Mike Rounds. And the truth is, it is only when enough \\\\nDemocrats and Republicans come together for these tough \\\\nthings----\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. And I agree with that. And I know it is \\\\nCongress&#x27;s idea, or Congress has to do this. But I also need \\\\nyou, as Social Security trustees, to advocate for, hey--you \\\\nknow, and create proposals.\\\\n    Also, I think the CBO needs a 10-year outlook. I created a \\\\nbill that would do this. It is an easy--an understandable graph \\\\nto accurately forecast where this is going to be. If we each \\\\nyear do not do anything, it gets even more and more \\\\ncataclysmic. And I think we are missing the point on that.\\\\n    You know, you think about Social Security makes up one-\\\\nfifth of our Federal spending in this--in our budget, one-\\\\nfifth. That is very significant. And it is an unfunded \\\\nliability that we got to tackle.\\\\n    Anyway, I want to get to something else. Child welfare \\\\nagencies often enroll eligible children, and then they collect \\\\nand use child&#x27;s SSI or survivor&#x27;s benefits to defray the cost \\\\nof that child foster care. And yet, many of our children and \\\\ntheir parents that have these children in foster care have no \\\\nidea that they are getting an SSA benefit.\\\\n    There is a letter that you sent out that says, ``I am \\\\ncommitted to taking action first, and quickly as possible, as I \\\\nplan to solicit public input on how Federal and state \\\\ngovernments can ensure a more reasonable conservation of the \\\\nSSA funds for these vulnerable children.&#x27;&#x27; So are you looking \\\\nat changing rules here or making rules?\\\\n    I mean, this is, again, very serious stuff that no one \\\\nknows how much is being taken, and these children don&#x27;t even \\\\nrealize that payment is being made on their behalf.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Correct. As a governor and as a mayor, I am \\\\ncertainly sensitized to the bad outcomes of kids aging out, as \\\\nthey say, aging out of foster care, being given their clothes \\\\nin a plastic bag on their birthday, and told good luck.\\\\n    There are a number of states that already have created new \\\\nrules. In fact, in 17 states they have had bills in the last \\\\nyear or two that would require the conservation of some of \\\\nthose dollars.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Right, so do you think we should create a \\\\nrule? Are you creating a rule? And do you think the Federal \\\\nGovernment should create law? What is your thought?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. If I can create a rule, I will.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. And I look to do that very quickly.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. If I can&#x27;t, and I need your authority based \\\\non what our counsel tells us, I will come back to you. Because \\\\nfor eight percent--it is not all of the kids in foster care----\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY [continuing]. But for the eight percent that \\\\nreceive benefits----\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Perfect.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY [continuing]. We can do better.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Yes, thank you. That is what--I appreciate \\\\nthat. And I humbly ask that you have got to--again, go back to \\\\nmy first question, is that we have got to get down to the \\\\nbottom and making sure that CBO and everybody knows how Social \\\\nSecurity is going to dramatically change in 8 to 10 years if we \\\\ndo nothing.\\\\n    Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Steube, \\\\nyou are now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    This past fall the Social Security Subcommittee held \\\\nmultiple hearings regarding the failure of the Social Security \\\\nAdministration to administer payments to beneficiaries. \\\\nCommissioner, I would like to follow up on the last time the \\\\nformer acting commissioner--and I probably won&#x27;t pronounce this \\\\nright--Kijakazi?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Kijakazi.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. I will let you say that--spoke before us, which \\\\nwas on October 18, 2023.\\\\n    I would also ask unanimous consent to submit her testimony \\\\nfor the record from that hearing.\\\\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n    Commissioner, as you may know, the acting administrator \\\\nprovided incomplete, unverified, and misleading data to this \\\\ncommittee related to overpayments at that hearing. We were \\\\nespecially concerned that SSA failed to disclose this mistake \\\\nfor weeks after it was first identified, and only disclosed it \\\\nto the committee after being forced to do so pursuant to a FOIA \\\\nrequest. This is unacceptable, and it makes me wonder what else \\\\nis going on at the agency, considering the continuous mistakes \\\\nand the lack of transparency. Are you aware of that \\\\ninteraction?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes sir, I am.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Is that--is she still with the agency?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, she is. She is serving in a senior \\\\nadviser position, and she is performing many of the duties of--\\\\nwe don&#x27;t have an acting deputy, so she is performing many of \\\\nthose duties.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So has there been any investigation by you as \\\\nto why she lied to this body, and misrepresented the numbers? \\\\nIs there going to be an investigation as to why it was \\\\nmisrepresented to us what the numbers were?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Congressman, I don&#x27;t blame you at all for \\\\nbeing skeptical for--and asking tough questions. But I can tell \\\\nyou from my 90 days of trying to untangle and get to the bottom \\\\naccurately of the overpayment causes, the numbers of people \\\\nseparate from the numbers of debts--because some people have \\\\nmore than one debt--sometimes people have a debt and then they \\\\nhave a second overpayment from another time----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Well, somebody had to have either provided her \\\\nwith those numbers that she then misled Congress of, or she \\\\nknew what the real numbers were and misled the committee \\\\nbecause she didn&#x27;t want to represent the totality of the \\\\nfailures of the Administration. So one of those two things \\\\nhappened. And if I was the administrator--why do you say no?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. I can----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. It--okay, all right, let&#x27;s go back. Do you \\\\nagree that she misrepresented the amount to this committee?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, but I don&#x27;t believe it was intentional.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. I can assure you----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So if it wasn&#x27;t intentional, was it somebody \\\\nthat provided her the wrong information?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Well, and I am sure when they gave it to her \\\\nthey didn&#x27;t think it was wrong, either.\\\\n    Congressman, I can assure you, in 90 days of looking at \\\\nthis, nobody 5 months ago really had a grasp of what the cause \\\\nand the effects and the results of the overpayments were. We \\\\nhave a much better grasp of that now, and I would be glad to \\\\nprovide that to you. And we have much more accurate numbers \\\\nnow.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Okay. Well, in my exchange with her she \\\\nbasically said that they are accountable--and I have already \\\\nentered the transcript for the record--they are accountable \\\\nbecause they hold themselves accountable, which doesn&#x27;t make \\\\nany sense.\\\\n    So can you give me a different or more coherent answer \\\\nabout how there will be accountability for mistakes at the \\\\nSocial Security Administration, when the mistakes are being \\\\nmade by the people who work there and it is affecting \\\\ntaxpayers?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. You know, we--the agency--and I am \\\\nnew to the agency, you know, I didn&#x27;t come up in the culture of \\\\nthe agency, but they have a mantra that their mission is to get \\\\nthe right amount to the right person at the right time. And by \\\\nand large, we do so.\\\\n    Yes, we were--I was surprised to find, when we actually \\\\nlooked at the actual number of overpayments and the trend over \\\\ntime, there is not more overpayments than there have been over \\\\nthe last five years. But because of the decline in staffing to \\\\n27-year lows, and it taking us longer to catch up with those \\\\noverpayments, the amount of the overpayments is higher now than \\\\nit was pre-COVID times.\\\\n    So when we make a mistake, though, this--it might only look \\\\non paper like it is one half of a percent or two percent, but \\\\nthat is a lot of Americans. And we need to do better----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So my question was, are you doing anything to \\\\nensure that this isn&#x27;t happening again?\\\\n    Like, is there going to be----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE [continuing]. Consequences for people who work \\\\nin your agencies who make mistakes?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes. Well, certainly. And if they do it \\\\nintentionally, pretty dire consequences.\\\\n    A number of the committee staff have come to our Security \\\\nStat. And Congressman, I would invite you to come and see how \\\\nwe are improving the accuracy of our data and the sharing of \\\\nthat data every day. And----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. All right, I want to shift because I have only \\\\ngot 30 seconds left.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. On page five of her testimony--this is the last \\\\ntime she was before this committee--she stated, and I quote, \\\\n``We intend to publish a proposed rule changing our overpayment \\\\nrecovery waiver rules to streamline processes and reduce burden \\\\nso eligible individuals can more easily seek debt relief. Our \\\\ngoal is to ensure that overpayment recovery does not unduly \\\\nburden those in underserved, vulnerable, or marginalized \\\\ncommunities.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    And I asked her specifically about communities of color, \\\\nwhich is what she was referring to. Commissioner, do you \\\\nbelieve that your agency should consider race as a factor in \\\\ndetermining benefits?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. No, I do not, although I do believe we should \\\\nalways be mindful of the disparate impact of our policies, and \\\\nalso of our congressional mandate to make sure that this \\\\nprogram--that people have equal access to this program, \\\\nregardless of race, creed----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So you can assure----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY [continuing]. Color, or where they live.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE [continuing]. This committee today that \\\\nsomeone&#x27;s race, religion, gender will not be a factor in the \\\\noverpayment recovery rule that the former acting commissioner \\\\nreferenced in her testimony?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, I can assure you of that. And at the \\\\nsame time, we will be very mindful of--not to put up any \\\\nbarriers for anybody to be able to access overpayments--I mean, \\\\nrather, the remedy of overpayments not of their making.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. My time has expired, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Okay, thank you. We are going to go get \\\\none more person here.\\\\n    Commissioner O&#x27;Malley, as you will find out very quickly \\\\nhere, schedule is a mere suggestion of the possibility of what \\\\nmight could happen if everything goes well. We have a vote \\\\nseries that has been called.\\\\n    Mr. Smith, I am going to call on you. Then we will recess \\\\nuntil immediately following the last vote series. Mr. Smith, \\\\nyou are recognized.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Commissioner, for sharing your time here \\\\ntoday. I appreciate hearing you reflect on the changes that \\\\nhave been made that hopefully are heading customer service in a \\\\nbetter direction within the Social Security Administration.\\\\n    I am very concerned that, you know, not enough progress has \\\\nbeen made before now accepting the responsibility of this \\\\nproposal to administer paid family leave. You know, I think we \\\\nsaw problems at IRS when they took on the new responsibilities \\\\nof becoming a payment distribution agency during COVID, making \\\\ntheir customer service problems even worse than they were \\\\nprior. And I just have significant concerns.\\\\n    You know, there is staffing shortages everywhere, you know, \\\\nand there are various complications with teleworking and so \\\\nforth. I think you have made some changes to that, as well. But \\\\nI just have serious reservations that Social Security can or \\\\nshould accept the paid family leave administration. And should \\\\nthe administration--Social Security Administration not focus on \\\\nproperly implementing and administering the existing programs \\\\nbefore proposing to undertake such a massive new program as \\\\npaid family leave?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Well, certainly, Congressman, we need to get \\\\nback to the 1.2 percent overhead that we traditionally have \\\\nbeen able to use to provide the customer service we need to.\\\\n    Having said that, we could also administer paid family \\\\nleave, provided, as the President has provided in his budget, \\\\nthere is the staffing that goes with this.\\\\n    But you are right. If we go down to----\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Staffing from where?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. What, the funding for it?\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Well, the funding might be there, \\\\nbut that does not actually fulfill the staffing needs that \\\\nexist.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Well, we would have to hire up staff in order \\\\nto do it.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. And where do you believe those \\\\nemployees would be found?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Oh, there is--there are people who want to \\\\nwork at our agency who we can&#x27;t hire because of a hiring freeze \\\\nand a lack of money.\\\\n    There are people--I think we need to change our strategy as \\\\nan agency. I think we target too much on college graduates and \\\\nnot enough on high school and community college graduates. And \\\\nwith proper training, that could really be an investment that \\\\nholds for a long time.\\\\n    You know, we used to have a program at SSA called--what was \\\\nit? Something about students. Stay in School, Kids. And I met \\\\npeople in Kansas City and town halls, employee town halls \\\\nacross the country. They have now been with the agency 40 \\\\nyears, but they said, ``I was a Stay in School, Kid when they \\\\nhired me 40 years ago out of high school,&#x27;&#x27; so we could hire \\\\nthem if there is the money for it.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. So it is your assessment, though, \\\\nthat you have a surplus of applicants?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes----\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Now?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, sir. I believe we have no shortage of \\\\napplicants. We had a big hiring spike thanks to, you know, the \\\\nanomaly that you all approved in the budget last year. And we \\\\nare--with direct hiring authority, we were able to hire up \\\\npretty quickly.\\\\n    Sadly, though, in the flood of highest beneficiaries and \\\\ncustomers ever and our training taking a knock, we saw a lot of \\\\nthem quit in their first year because of how overworked and \\\\noverwhelmed they were.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Just for verification, is it still \\\\nthe case that walking in without an appointment is less of a \\\\nwait than calling in over the phone?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. It depends on which phone. In our field \\\\noffices, the calls get answered in three to five minutes, on \\\\naverage. On the 1-800 number, the week ending March 8 we had \\\\ngotten it down to 31 minutes, but it has averaged 39, 49, and \\\\nsome individual calls--you will hear horror stories from your \\\\nconstituents, I am sure, that people are waiting an hour.\\\\n    I heard one story of a person----\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. But shouldn&#x27;t the 800 number be even \\\\nmore efficient than----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. You would think. This is our thirty-fifth \\\\nanniversary of the 1-800 number. And back in the day, when \\\\nSocial Security advanced new customer service technologies, \\\\nthey were all very, very proud of it, and it was more \\\\neffective. But given problems during COVID, and procuring a new \\\\nsystem, and the failure of that system to work properly, it has \\\\nmade the 800 number a real challenge.\\\\n    And I had a call with the CEO of Verizon, who assured me \\\\njust a couple of days ago that he would get back to me before \\\\nthe end of the week about how they can resolve what is \\\\nessentially failing business intelligence at the center of that \\\\nsystem that leads to a lot of dumped calls every day, or what \\\\nsome in the industry--their industry, not mine or yours--would \\\\ncall polite hang-ups. I don&#x27;t think any hang up is polite when \\\\nsomebody has been on hold for an hour.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I know it can be very frustrating.\\\\n    In the interest of time, I will yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you. We will stand in recess until \\\\nimmediately following this vote series.\\\\n    [Recess.]\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Welcome back. We are in session. The \\\\ngentlelady from Wisconsin is recognized for five minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Moore, the floor is yours.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, \\\\nand thank you for your indulgence.\\\\n    And I want to thank you, Mr. Commissioner. Nice to see you \\\\nin this role, putting people over politics.\\\\n    I was very interested in some of the line of questioning I \\\\nheard from my other colleagues here. I think it is really \\\\nappropriate for them to be concerned about the error rates, \\\\nespecially when it creates a situation where people have \\\\nliabilities. And of course, like, they are burdened with paying \\\\nit back. And I appreciate that you have limited the amount that \\\\nyou would recoup at one time.\\\\n    And of course, the customer service wait times. When I \\\\nheard 20 minutes, I was about to say that person must have had \\\\nan inside track or something to only wait 20 minutes. It must \\\\nhave been a prince, or king, or somebody, because that is not \\\\nmy experience.\\\\n    But I guess I want you to sort of draw the nexus between \\\\nthe lowest rate of employees in the last 20 years and the \\\\nefforts to cut Social Security, and how that is a nexus, or \\\\ncontributes to the error rate. Is there a nexus between low \\\\ncustomer service and not being able to improve capacity?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, Congresswoman. The nexus, I would say--I \\\\nmean, overall, Social Security is a customer-facing agency that \\\\nis all about customer service. Even the people that are working \\\\nin IT, it is to the end--the purpose of serving the beneficiary \\\\ncustomer, the people that paid in, worked hard their whole \\\\nlives. And as part of that, until 2018 anyway, part of what \\\\nthey paid for was a high level of customer service so they \\\\nweren&#x27;t on hold for an hour, they didn&#x27;t die waiting for a \\\\ndisability determination to be made.\\\\n    That has been eroded because, I mean--and as I said at the \\\\noutset, I am really grateful to the chairman and this committee \\\\nfor even holding a hearing on Social Security&#x27;s budget, because \\\\nwe haven&#x27;t had a budget hearing here in nine long years. I \\\\nmean, I know it is Ways and Means, and I understand the \\\\nnuances, but the fact remains that by not having a budget and \\\\nnot focusing on this, essentially we have seen nine years of \\\\ndecline so that we are now operating on less than one percent. \\\\nIn fact, it is 0.94, that is----\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. You can&#x27;t get blood out of a \\\\nturnip, can&#x27;t expect you to perform.\\\\n    So I am going to ask you some more questions. Thank you. \\\\nYou have an Enterprise Scheduling System, the ESS, and also My \\\\nSocial Security Portal web-based services. I am the co-chair of \\\\nthe congressional Foster Youth Caucus, bipartisan. And you \\\\nknow, one of the things that we have learned from foster youth \\\\nis that sometimes they have a hard time accessing services to \\\\nwhich they may be entitled. So is this Enterprise Scheduling \\\\nSystem available to them, as minors, or only to their \\\\ncaretakers or payees?\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. That is a great question, and I do not know \\\\nthe answer.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. But I can check it out and get back to you, \\\\nCongresswoman.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Yes, I think that that is really a \\\\nbarrier that they sort of, you know, identify.\\\\n    So there are a lot of complaints, I think, about women not \\\\ngetting back into the workforce, or disabled people, would-be \\\\ndisabled people not being in the workforce. But I just want to \\\\ncomment that the United States is the only country in the OECD \\\\nthat doesn&#x27;t have unpaid leave for maternity leave. And, of \\\\ncourse, the U.S. and South Korea are the only countries that \\\\ndon&#x27;t have some sort of paid leave for illness. And I am \\\\nwondering if the President has thought about that in terms of \\\\nhis budget.\\\\n    And, you know, and we have people taking care of their sick \\\\nand elderly folks, and we pay a half-trillion dollars a year \\\\nfor uncompensated care. What does the President&#x27;s budget do----\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, ma&#x27;am. It is my understanding that the \\\\nPresident has proposed paid family leave, and also with \\\\nstaffing and--funding for staffing included that the Social \\\\nSecurity Administration would administer. We can do that, \\\\nespecially since there is staffing and dollars for the staffing \\\\nto do it. And I would think it is high time, for all of the \\\\nreasons you pointed out.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. And I have one last question.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. I have some born-again Christians \\\\nwho are on SSI, and they feel guilty because they can&#x27;t get \\\\nmarried, they don&#x27;t think. They don&#x27;t want to shack up and live \\\\ntogether. And they say that, as SSI recipients, they can&#x27;t get \\\\nmarried. Is that a bias that has some basis in your belief \\\\nabout fraud, or--this is a group of people who feel persecuted.\\\\n    Mr. O&#x27;MALLEY. Yes, ma&#x27;am. As I understand it so far--and I \\\\nam learning every day--this very, very complex program to \\\\nadminister has an inherent sort of marriage bias in it because \\\\nit--there is--they have to calculate--if two people are in the \\\\nsame household, it can reduce the amount that they qualify for, \\\\nbecause the assumption is that they are both, you know, sharing \\\\nsome expenses in that household. It has the effect that you \\\\njust outlined of discouraging people from being married.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Well, maybe we can revisit it when \\\\nI have more time, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. I just wasn&#x27;t sure where you were going \\\\nto go with the shacking up comment. I am just glad you didn&#x27;t \\\\nask----\\\\n    [Laughter.]\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Well, you know----\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON [continuing]. The advice of a----\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. All I can say is that I have relied \\\\non Republicans to find me a husband in the past, and they have \\\\nnot done so. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. And so you just have to do what you \\\\nhave to do.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. My goodness, I better not respond to \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman FERGUSON. Thank you, my friend.\\\\n    You know, I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for \\\\nbeing here again. Thank you for hanging around while we had \\\\nthat vote series.\\\\n    This was a very informative hearing, we appreciate the \\\\ncandor of your answers. I get a sense of sincerity that you are \\\\ntrying to do the right thing here. You are new on the job.

We \\\\nappreciate our witnesses coming today. In your name we pray. \\\\nAmen.\\\\n    I now call the committee on small business to order. \\\\nWithout objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess \\\\nof the committee at any time.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for my opening statement.\\\\n    Good morning to all of you again. Thank you for being here, \\\\nand welcome to today&#x27;s hearing which will focus on examining \\\\nthe detrimental effects of the Department of Energy&#x27;s \\\\nregulations on our nation&#x27;s job creators.\\\\n    First I want to thank our witnesses for joining us today, \\\\nand I know you traveled to be with us this morning. We \\\\nappreciate, again, all of you taking time to do so.\\\\n    The Biden administration seemingly has it out for Main \\\\nStreet America. Through their misguided economic policies and \\\\nincreased regulatory requirements, small businesses are finding \\\\nit harder to make ends meet.\\\\n    Rather than looking for growth opportunities, small \\\\nbusinesses are forced to play defense in order to deal with a \\\\nwhole host of new regulations coming down the pipeline.\\\\n    President Biden&#x27;s Energy Department has been especially \\\\nactive in the past few years in passing new rules that have \\\\ndramatic repercussions on small businesses. By implementing \\\\ntighter energy-efficient standards, manufacturers are being \\\\nforced to change significant portions of their operations.\\\\n    This is increasing the cost of producing this equipment \\\\nwhich is ultimately passed along to businesses and the American \\\\npeople. The actions are forcing Main Street America to foot the \\\\nbill for this administration&#x27;s radical climate agenda.\\\\n    Inflation remains a top concern for job creators, yet the \\\\nDOE&#x27;s new regulations on gas stoves, ceiling fans, and \\\\ntransformers are increasing costs for businesses and consumers \\\\nalike.\\\\n    Not only are these new standards forcing businesses to \\\\npurchase updated equipment, but they are reducing consumer \\\\nchoice in the marketplace. Competition and consumer preference \\\\nshould be what determines what is produced, not government \\\\nmandates.\\\\n    These policies provide minimal benefit to our small \\\\nbusinesses and only make it harder for them to operate. So \\\\nwhile small businesses suffer under this administration, their \\\\nconcerns continue to be ignored.\\\\n    It is the job of this committee to be main street&#x27;s voice \\\\nin Washington, and we are proud to have this hearing to shine a \\\\nlight on the devastating effects of these new actions taken by \\\\nthe Biden administration.\\\\n    And if we want to ensure America continues to have a \\\\nthriving small business economy, our agencies must do better by \\\\nlistening to main street--repeat, listening to main street--\\\\nthroughout the rulemaking process and limit the negative \\\\nimpacts of new regulations.\\\\n    The government should be in the business of ensuring the \\\\neconomy works for Americans and guaranteeing regulations aren&#x27;t \\\\nhamstringing job creators. This committee&#x27;s goal is to ensure \\\\nMain Street America is given a fair shot at the American Dream.\\\\n    Our nation&#x27;s job creators have been forced to endure \\\\nprofound challenges over the past--last couple of years, and I \\\\nhope this hearing helps spotlight some of the detrimental \\\\nconsequences of this administration&#x27;s regulatory policies and \\\\nwill help us come up with solutions to support our nation&#x27;s \\\\nsmall businesses.\\\\n    Again, I want to thank you all for being here today with \\\\nus. I am looking forward to today&#x27;s conversation.\\\\n    With that, I want to yield to our distinguished Ranking \\\\nMember from New York, Ms. Velazquez, for her opening remarks.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Chairman Williams. As Members of \\\\nthe Small Business Committee, we understand that complying with \\\\nfederal, state, and local regulations can be burdensome for \\\\nsmall business owners, and that is why Congress created the \\\\nOffice of Advocacy to ensure that federal agencies are taking \\\\nthe views of small businesses into consideration throughout the \\\\nrule-writing process.\\\\n    In our oversight role, we can send letters, hold hearings, \\\\nand request meetings in an effort to hold agencies accountable \\\\nto the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\\\\n    The Department of Energy is required, under the bipartisan \\\\nEnergy Policy and Conservation Act, to establish energy \\\\nconservation standards for approximately 60 consumer products \\\\nand reevaluate them every 6 years.\\\\n    Unfortunately, the previous administration violated the law \\\\nand missed 26 deadlines, including one for distribution \\\\ntransformers.\\\\n    Don&#x27;t be fooled by some of the rhetoric you may hear today. \\\\nThe Trump DOE was sued, and as part of a court settlement, the \\\\nBiden administration is required to review these long overdue \\\\nstandards. This isn&#x27;t a case of federal overreach.\\\\n    The reality is, the Trump delays hurt small businesses, \\\\ncosting them more to do business. Since taking office, the \\\\nBiden administration has issued efficiency standards for more \\\\nthan 20 product categories, saving Americans $570 billion and \\\\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.4 billion \\\\nmetric tons over 30 years.\\\\n    That translates into significant energy savings for small \\\\nbusinesses.\\\\n    Today I hope to have a productive discussion about energy \\\\nconservation standards that lower energy bills for small \\\\nbusinesses, and I would like also to learn more about the steps \\\\nthat the Department of Energy is taking to consider small \\\\nbusinesses throughout the rule-writing process.\\\\n    Maybe in the near future we can bring the federal agencies \\\\nto hear directly from them, and to give them an opportunity to \\\\nexplain their thinking.\\\\n    I would like to request that the written testimony of \\\\nAndrew deLaski, the Executive Director of the Appliance \\\\nStandards Awareness Project be entered into the record.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. So ordered.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you. And I will now introduce our \\\\nwitnesses. Unfortunately, our original witness, Mr. Ben \\\\nLieberman is sick and unable to testify. So, Mr. Marlo Lewis, \\\\nwe have gone to the bullpen and brought you out, and we \\\\nappreciate you being here today on such short notice.\\\\n    So Mr. Lewis is a senior fellow at the Competitive \\\\nEnterprise Institute located here in Washington, D.C. Mr. Lewis \\\\nspecializes in energy and public policy issues, and previously \\\\nhe served as the director of external relations at the Reason \\\\nFoundation Los Angeles and the staff director of the House \\\\nGovernment Reform Subcommittee on National Economic Growth, \\\\nNatural Resources, and Regulatory Affairs.\\\\n    Mr. Lewis, thank you for being with us again today, and we \\\\nlook forward to hearing your conversation with us.\\\\n    Our next witness here today is Ms. Alicia Huey. Ms. Huey is \\\\npresident of AGH Homes located in Birmingham, Alabama. AGH \\\\nHomes is a custom homebuilding company which specializes in \\\\nhigh-end custom homes for buyers on individual lots.\\\\n    Ms. Huey has also been an active Member of the National \\\\nAssociation of Home Builders and is currently serving as the \\\\nChairman of the Board of Directors.\\\\n    And while attending the University of Montevallo and \\\\nvolunteering for Habitat for Humanity, she decided to switch \\\\ncareers from early childhood education to homebuilding.\\\\n    Ms. Huey, thank you for being here today, and we look \\\\nforward to this important conversation ahead.\\\\n    Our next witness here with us today is Mr. Jeff Bauman. Mr. \\\\nBauman is manager of regulatory affairs at National \\\\nRefrigeration located in Pennsylvania. Mr. Bauman has been with \\\\nNational Refrigeration, a full-service HVAC and plumbing \\\\nmechanical contractor since 2008.\\\\n    Prior to working at National Refrigeration, he spent 21 \\\\nyears as director of the engineering at Victory Refrigeration. \\\\nMr. Bauman attended Drexel University where he received his \\\\nbachelor of science in mechanical engineering.\\\\n    Mr. Bauman, thank you for being here today, and we look \\\\nforward to your testimony.\\\\n    And now I recognize the Ranking Member from New York, Ms. \\\\nVelazquez, to briefly introduce our last witness appearing \\\\nbefore us today.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. It is my pleasure to introduce \\\\nProfessor Emily Hammond who is a nationally recognized expert \\\\nin energy, environment, and administrative law. Professor \\\\nHammond&#x27;s research on policy work has focused on transparency \\\\nand public participation in the regulatory processes. She has \\\\nserved as the Deputy Counsel for litigation, regulations, and \\\\nenforcement at the Department of Energy as well.\\\\n    Welcome, Professor, and thank you for being here with us \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you. And we appreciate, again, all \\\\nof you being with us on this date.\\\\n    So before recognizing the witnesses, I would like to remind \\\\nthem that their oral testimony is restricted to 5 minutes in \\\\nlength. If you hear me do this, you need to shut it down. Okay?\\\\n    And if you see the light turn red in front of you, it means \\\\nyour 5 minutes has concluded and you should wrap up your \\\\ntestimony.\\\\n    So with that, I now recognize Mr. Lewis for his 5-minute \\\\nopening remarks.\\\\n\\\\n     STATEMENTS OF MARLO LEWIS, SENIOR FELLOW, COMPETITIVE \\\\nENTERPRISE INSTITUTE; ALICIA HUEY, PRESIDENT, AGH HOMES, INC.; \\\\n     JEFF BAUMAN, MANAGER OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS, NATIONAL \\\\n   REFRIGERATION &amp; AIR CONDITIONING PRODUCTS, INC; AND EMILY \\\\n  HAMMOND, PROFESSOR OF LAW, THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY\\\\n\\\\n                    STATEMENT OF MARLO LEWIS\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Chairman Williams, Ranking Member Velazquez, and \\\\nCommittee Members, thank you for the opportunity to testify. I \\\\nam Marlo Lewis, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise \\\\nInstitute, and as you have heard, I am filling in today for my \\\\ncolleague, Ben Lieberman, who is ill and can&#x27;t be here, but he \\\\nsends his regrets, and I want to thank the committee for \\\\nunderstanding these last-minute circumstances.\\\\n    Appliance overregulation has been a problem for years, and \\\\nthings have gotten worse since January 2023. The year began \\\\nwith the Chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission \\\\ntelling the media that a ban on gas stoves is a real \\\\npossibility.\\\\n    That sparked a powerful public backlash, followed by \\\\nstrenuous denials from the Biden administration that any such \\\\nban was under consideration.\\\\n    And then only weeks later, the Department of Energy opened \\\\na second regulatory front against gas stoves. While DOE did not \\\\npropose an outright ban, compliance stoves would have to \\\\nsacrifice product features that have helped make gas the choice \\\\nof 38 percent of homeowners and the strong preference of many \\\\nserious cooks--and all for the energy savings that DOE \\\\nestimated at $1.51 per year.\\\\n    Other DOE efficiency rulemakings in 2023 target \\\\ndishwashers, water heaters, ceiling fans, furnaces, and washing \\\\nmachines.\\\\n    Each proposed or final rule likely entails higher appliance \\\\nprices, compromised performance, and reduced choices.\\\\n    With a regulatory agenda so out of touch with what most \\\\npeople want, it is not surprising that Congress is pushing back \\\\nwith legislative initiatives to repeal specific appliance \\\\nregulations, defund their implementation, or reform the entire \\\\nprogram.\\\\n    So far most of the attention has been on the adverse \\\\nconsumer impacts. This hearing adds a much needed focus on the \\\\nequally concerning small business impacts. As with homeowners, \\\\nsmall businesses already face hardship and risk from high \\\\ngasoline prices, rising interest rates, and regulatory \\\\ncampaigns to transform America&#x27;s motor vehicle electricity and \\\\nfinancial sectors.\\\\n    The last thing small businesses need is a bunch of new \\\\nappliance mandates that they didn&#x27;t ask for.\\\\n    I would note that DOE efficiency standards need not target \\\\ncommercial-grade equipment to hinder small businesses. For \\\\nexample, many catering businesses operate out of people&#x27;s homes \\\\nand use consumer stoves.\\\\n    Many home-based chefs depend on the high heat setting of \\\\ngas stoves for searing and stir-frying. So for them, an \\\\nelectrification mandate is simply unacceptable.\\\\n    I should also note that DOE&#x27;s stove and furnace rules are \\\\npart of the Biden administration&#x27;s climate policy plan to phase \\\\nout natural gas usage and electrify everything. Yet DOE admits \\\\nthat electricity is three times more expensive than gas on a \\\\nper-unit energy basis.\\\\n    The electrification agenda disfavors small businesses that \\\\nrely on natural gas for cooking, heating, and other purposes.\\\\n    DOE&#x27;s efficiency standards also impose costs on small \\\\nbusinesses that manufacture appliances. That topic deserves \\\\nmore attention and study.\\\\n    And in general, I think we would all agree that small \\\\nbusinesses already incur a higher per-employee regulatory costs \\\\nthan do large firms.\\\\n    The best reform, it seems to me, is to sunset DOE&#x27;s \\\\nstandard-setting authority entirely. Doing so would have no \\\\ndown side for small businesses, only an up side. Any business \\\\nowner that actually wants to purchase or manufacture the kinds \\\\nof appliances favored by DOE will always be free to do so, with \\\\nor without such regulations.\\\\n    The only thing that appliance efficiency mandates \\\\naccomplish is to force government&#x27;s particular preference on \\\\neveryone, including the businesses that don&#x27;t want them.\\\\n    So we recommend--CEI recommends that Congress use the \\\\nCongressional Review Act and other authorities to take on each \\\\nand every rule that imposes hardships on small businesses.\\\\n    Thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. Lewis.\\\\n    I now recognize Ms. Huey for her 5-minute opening remarks.\\\\n\\\\n                    STATEMENT OF ALICIA HUEY\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Thank you, and I am pleased to appear before you \\\\ntoday on behalf of the National Association of Home Builders to \\\\nshare our views on how the Department of Energy regulations are \\\\nadding to the affordability crisis.\\\\n    Access to safe, decent, and affordable housing is essential \\\\nto the well-being of all Americans. While today&#x27;s hearing is \\\\nfocused specifically on Department of Energy regulations, there \\\\nare a vast array of regulatory burdens imposed on the \\\\nhomebuilding industry.\\\\n    On average, regulations imposed by all levels of government \\\\naccount for nearly 25 percent of the price of a single-family \\\\nhome and over 40 percent of the cost of a typical multifamily \\\\ndevelopment.\\\\n    Government policies and regulations are making it harder \\\\nfor homebuilders and multifamily developers to build housing \\\\nthat is affordable. I would like to share three examples of how \\\\nexcessive regulations originating from the Department of Energy \\\\nworsen the housing affordability.\\\\n    Number one is the transformer standards. Soaring costs and \\\\nshortages of electrical distribution transfers are delaying \\\\nhousing projects across the nation. Some projects face an 18- \\\\nto 24-month wait for a transformer.\\\\n    The administration is well aware of the shortages of \\\\nelectrical transformers, yet DOE is pursuing a regulatory \\\\nchange that will make the situation much worse.\\\\n    Specifically, DOE is seeking to increase the energy \\\\nefficiency of transformers by a mere one-tenth of a percentage \\\\npoint. This requirement would force manufacturers to retool \\\\nproduction lines and worsen the historic backlog.\\\\n    Transformers are an essential part of the electrical grid, \\\\nand homes cannot be sold unless a transformer is installed and \\\\nworking.\\\\n    DOE&#x27;s proposal will have little impact on energy efficiency \\\\nand will exacerbate the current transformer shortage. This is \\\\nwhy NAHB supports the Protecting America&#x27;s Distribution \\\\nTransformer Supply Chain Act.\\\\n    The legislation would prohibit the Secretary of Energy from \\\\nchanging energy conservation standards for distribution \\\\ntransformers for a period of 5 years, which would allow time \\\\nfor the market to stabilize and so manufacturers could catch up \\\\nwith the demand.\\\\n    The next DOE regulation concerns gas stoves. DOE has \\\\nproposed a rule that would ban the sale of most current gas \\\\ncook top models sold in the United States.\\\\n    Currently more than 187 million Americans use natural gas \\\\nappliances, saving them an average of $1,068 each year.\\\\n    Each American deserves to live in a home of their choice, \\\\nin a location of their choice, and fueled by the energy type of \\\\ntheir choice. Neither DOE, nor the administration, should take \\\\nthese options away.\\\\n    And finally the Building Energy Codes. The Inflation \\\\nReduction Act included $1 billion in grants to States that \\\\nadopt updated Energy Codes, specifically, the 2021 Energy Code.\\\\n    Adoption of the 2021 Code adds as much as $31,000 to the \\\\nprice of a new home.\\\\n    NAHB understands the importance of energy efficiency, but \\\\nthe savings from the 2021 Code can take a homeowner as long as \\\\n90 years to see payback. That is not a reasonable trade-off.\\\\n    If you want to make a difference on energy efficiency, we \\\\nmust focus on existing housing, particularly older homes built \\\\nbefore the introduction of modern Energy Codes.\\\\n    According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, \\\\nupgrades to the existing housing stock could yield a projected \\\\nreduction of 5.7 percent of the total annual U.S. electricity \\\\nconsumption by 2030.\\\\n    Given this potential, upgrading the existing housing stock \\\\nmust be the primary focus if the nation is going to make \\\\nmeasurable progress.\\\\n    That billion dollars could have been spent smarter by \\\\nfocusing on upgrading older homes versus making new, already \\\\nenergy-efficient housing unaffordable for many American \\\\nfamilies.\\\\n    Improving the nation&#x27;s housing supply and easing housing \\\\naffordability challenges will take a coordinated and concerted \\\\neffort at all levels of government. Let&#x27;s begin by fixing the \\\\nbroken regulatory process.\\\\n    Congress should pass legislation such as the Small Business \\\\nRegulatory Flexibility Improvement Act to ensure that all \\\\nregulations are designed with small businesses in mind, that \\\\nregulatory rulemaking agencies are required to consider the \\\\ntrue cost of regulations on small businesses, and that agencies \\\\ncomply with the letter and intent of the law in crafting new \\\\nlegislation.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity, and we look forward to \\\\nworking with you.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you, Ms. Huey.\\\\n    And now I want to recognize Mr. Bauman for his 5-minute \\\\nopening remarks.\\\\n\\\\n                  STATEMENT OF JEFFREY BAUMAN\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Thank you, Chairman Williams, Ranking Member \\\\nVelazquez, and distinguished Members of the Committee. My name \\\\nis Jeffrey Bauman. I am the manager of regulatory affairs for \\\\nNational Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Products, which \\\\nembodies Continental Refrigerator and National Comfort \\\\nProducts.\\\\n    I am truly thankful and honored for the opportunity to \\\\ndiscuss the impact of Department of Energy regulations on small \\\\nbusinesses like ours.\\\\n    I have worked in the commercial, food service equipment \\\\nindustry for over 34 years, including the past 15 years with \\\\nContinental where I previously held the position of engineering \\\\nmanager.\\\\n    Approximately 2 years ago our company made the decision \\\\nthat a new full-time position was needed to help manage the \\\\nbarrage of multiple regulatory actions that continue to \\\\nconfront our companies, and I took over that role.\\\\n    National Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Products is a \\\\nsmall, domestic manufacturer that represents approximately 250 \\\\nhigh quality manufacturing jobs in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.\\\\n    Continental Refrigerator is a leading manufacturer of \\\\ncommercial refrigeration equipment, offering over 2,500 \\\\ndifferent model configurations. We design, build, and certify \\\\nall of our products to provide superior performance, to \\\\nmaintain safe food temperatures in the harsh environments of \\\\ncommercial kitchens.\\\\n    Our products must comply with numerous regulations for \\\\nsafety and sanitation as well as DOE energy regulations. The \\\\nrefrigerants and foam insulations that are critical components \\\\nof these products, must comply with EPA global warming \\\\npotential, or GWP, limits.\\\\n    Our company has made significant investments in research \\\\nand development, and production changes over the past 6 years \\\\nto transition to extremely low GWP insulation and convert over \\\\n99 percent of our products to self-contained R-290 refrigerant, \\\\nwith the lowest GWP available for these types of products.\\\\n    Multimillion dollar capital expenditures made for new \\\\nproduction equipment, including new temperature-controlled foam \\\\nfixtures to address flow issues with the new low-GWP foams, and \\\\nnew charging stations required for flammable refrigerants.\\\\n    We also built in-house, state-of-the-art, laboratory-grade \\\\ntest chambers. These labs continue to run around the clock 7 \\\\ndays a week to evaluate product performance and manage the \\\\nmultitude of energy testing required for regulatory compliance.\\\\n    As a small manufacturer in a heavy regulated industry, \\\\nContinental is particularly challenged by continual changes in \\\\nregulations while working to control rising costs and develop \\\\ninnovative products in a highly competitive market.\\\\n    In 2017, we discontinued a line of horizontal freezers that \\\\ncould not economically meet new DOE energy standards. We \\\\ncompete with numerous, low-cost, imported products from foreign \\\\nmanufacturers who benefit from government subsidies.\\\\n    Despite our resource limitations, Continental is an active \\\\nmember of industry associations, including AHRI, NAFEM, ASHRAE, \\\\nASTM, and the NSF Standards Task Force. We hold positions on \\\\nnumerous committees that are critical to developing robust and \\\\nreliable industry test methods and standards.\\\\n    Our company actively works to engage with the Department of \\\\nEnergy and the EPA in rulemaking. We analyze and regularly \\\\nsubmit comments in response to Requests for Information and \\\\nproposed rules.\\\\n    This effort is critical to our business because compliance \\\\nwith excessive regulations significantly impedes our ability to \\\\ndevelop new products, which have been a keystone to the \\\\nsuccessful growth of our business.\\\\n    We also work with the Small Business Administration Office \\\\nof Advocacy and helped initiate a small business roundtable to \\\\ndiscuss concerns in the commercial refrigeration industry that \\\\nwe participated in last year with other stakeholders.\\\\n    On October 10th of this year, DOE published a Notice of \\\\nProposed Rulemaking in regards to energy conservation standards \\\\nfor commercial refrigerators and freezers. Our company, along \\\\nwith other manufacturers and industry associations, are \\\\nextremely concerned with DOE&#x27;s unrealistic proposals in this \\\\nnotice.\\\\n    Analysis of the proposed standard level shows extremely \\\\nexcessive reductions that are up to 60 percent lower than \\\\ncurrently allowed. We have been unable to identify any \\\\npotential paths to these types of extraordinary cuts.\\\\n    DOE&#x27;s consultants conducted manufacturing interviews that \\\\nwe participated prior to this proposed rule, but it appears the \\\\ninformation was not thoroughly evaluated for this rulemaking.\\\\n    Technology options that DOE indicates would reduce energy \\\\nconsumption in the near future, such as fan controls and high \\\\nefficiency fans motors, are already in use.\\\\n    Other proposed technologies, such as microchannel condenser \\\\ncoils, have so far proven to be impractical for many \\\\napplications. Proposed technologies, such as variable-speed \\\\ncompressors, have shown some promise in reducing energy \\\\nconsumption but have not proven to be economically viable \\\\noptions for many of our products over the next few years.\\\\n    Increasing our costs to adopt this technology would impede \\\\nour ability to compete against other products, particularly \\\\nthose from foreign manufacturers.\\\\n    A review of information in DOE&#x27;s Compliance Certification \\\\nDatabase indicates that more than 85 percent of self-contained \\\\nproducts currently certified would fail to meet the new \\\\nstandards.\\\\n    Manufacturers would have to redesign almost every product \\\\nto significantly reduce energy consumption in a very short \\\\nperiod of time, using proposed technologies that are not \\\\nproven.\\\\n    Another example of what we believe is DOE overreach is DOE \\\\nadding refrigerated chef bases to the scope. There is no test \\\\nprocedure for this product that has been proven to be tested, \\\\nand DOE is proposing new standards for products that have not \\\\nbeen evaluated properly.\\\\n    Thank you again for this opportunity to share the \\\\ninformation about our company, and the significant burden \\\\npresented by DOE regulations on small businesses like ours. We \\\\nlook forward to working with Congress to address these concerns \\\\nand will continue to engage with regulatory agencies.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you, Mr. Bauman.\\\\n    I now recognize Professor Hammond for her 5-minute opening \\\\nremarks.\\\\n\\\\n                   STATEMENT OF EMILY HAMMOND\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Thank you, Chairman Williams, Ranking Member \\\\nVelazquez, and distinguished Members of the Committee for the \\\\nopportunity to testify today.\\\\n    I will be testifying concerning the Department of Energy&#x27;s \\\\napproach to rulemaking for its Energy Conservation Standards \\\\nProgram, how the process is structured to ensure that the \\\\nvoices of small businesses are heard and how these standards \\\\nbenefit small businesses.\\\\n    As you noted, I am a professor of law, and I previously \\\\nserved at the Department of Energy, but the testimony I offer \\\\ntoday is my own, and I don&#x27;t represent or speak for any party.\\\\n    Before I speak about the legal requirements DOE must follow \\\\nto complete its standards, I want to emphasize that my \\\\nexperience with the Agency revealed a committed group of \\\\nprofessionals, whether lawyers, engineers, or economists, who \\\\ndid not treat these legal requirements as boxes to check but \\\\nrather thoughtfully carried out both the letter and the spirit \\\\nof these laws in service of good governance.\\\\n    I will begin with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, \\\\nor EPCA. As you know, Congress passed EPCA in 1975 at a time \\\\nwhen consumer energy costs were rising and there was a scarcity \\\\nof energy resources to meet rising demand.\\\\n    Congress, itself, set the first energy efficiency \\\\nstandards, and it directed DOE to periodically reassess those \\\\nstandards and update them using a detailed set of criteria.\\\\n    The standards must achieve the maximum improvement in \\\\nenergy efficiency that are technologically feasible and \\\\neconomically justified, and the standards must result in a \\\\nsignificant conservation of energy.\\\\n    Congress explicitly instructed the agency to consider seven \\\\nfactors for this analysis, which include economic impact of the \\\\nstandards on manufacturers as well as consumers.\\\\n    DOE always sets forth its methodology for evaluating these \\\\nfactors in its proposed and final rules, and that methodology \\\\nallows it to hone in on costs and benefits to small businesses.\\\\n    In formulating these standards, DOE offers far more \\\\nopportunities to participate than required by the \\\\nAdministrative Procedure Act or EPCA, and indeed it will even \\\\ninterview small business owners to ensure that it is fully \\\\nconsidering their interests.\\\\n    This process also helps the agency ensure that it complies \\\\nwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the analysis for which is \\\\ndetailed in every proposed rule. That offers further \\\\nopportunities for engagement with the Agency before the rule is \\\\nfinal.\\\\n    Once a standard is adopted, there is usually a 3- to 5-year \\\\ntimeframe before compliance is expected, and under EPCA, small \\\\nbusinesses can seek an additional 2-year exception.\\\\n    Moreover, DOE offers guidance to small businesses in plain \\\\nlanguage on the website, complete with real phone numbers to \\\\ncall, and a searchable FAQ section. So small businesses can \\\\neasily learn how to seek an exception or to get assistance in \\\\nunderstanding their obligations.\\\\n    It bears emphasis that this program brings concrete \\\\nbenefits on householders, small businesses, and other \\\\ncommercial enterprises in the form of real and meaningful \\\\nsavings.\\\\n    For example, one recent study concluded that energy \\\\nconservation standards saved businesses almost $23 billion \\\\nnationwide.\\\\n    Each proposed and final rule also documents these kinds of \\\\nsavings, like the $9 billion that consumers will save under the \\\\nproposed battery charger standards.\\\\n    These consumers are small businesses themselves, and also \\\\nthe owners and employees of these small businesses whose \\\\nfinancial pressures at home are diminished when their bills are \\\\nlower.\\\\n    There are other benefits too. By reducing energy use, these \\\\nstandards reduce air pollution, which brings health benefits \\\\nand avoids lower worker productivity and lost work days.\\\\n    Those kinds of disruptions are especially hard on small \\\\nbusinesses, which are already feeling the strain of labor \\\\nsupply shortages.\\\\n    And as climate disruption presents even more risks to the \\\\neconomy and worker well-being, this important program&#x27;s \\\\nadditional benefits should not be understated.\\\\n    Reduced energy reliance translates to grid resiliency, and \\\\nof course reduced cost to consumers alleviate the burdens of \\\\nthose who are most impacted by climate disasters.\\\\n    DOE values its avoided greenhouse gas emissions and the \\\\nbillions of dollars for its major rules, and these benefits \\\\nextend to small businesses too.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I \\\\nlook forward to your questions.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you very much, and we will now \\\\nmove to the Member questions under the 5-minute rule. I \\\\nrecognize myself for 5 minutes.\\\\n    The Department of Energy is not typically thought of as a \\\\nregulatory entity. However, it appears the Biden administration \\\\nis working to undo these norms.\\\\n    Mr. Lewis, in your testimony, you highlight that you \\\\nbelieve the best thing that Congress could do to protect small \\\\nbusiness and consumers is to take away DOE&#x27;s standard-setting \\\\nauthority entirely.\\\\n    So, question, can you expand on why you feel this is an \\\\nimportant step and why DOE should not be the one responsible \\\\nfor setting these standards?\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Well, these standards have been developed over \\\\ndecades----\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Microphone.\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Oh, I am sorry. DOE has been setting these \\\\nstandards ever since EPCA was adopted--and perhaps parts of the \\\\nfederal government even before that--and EPCA was enacted in \\\\n1975.\\\\n    So we have had literally decades of mandatory increases in \\\\nenergy efficiency of appliances, and we have, I think, long \\\\npassed the point of capturing all the low-hanging fruit.\\\\n    And so we had an example that was mentioned before of \\\\nimproving energy efficiency by one-tenth of 1 percent, and it \\\\nis really hard to believe that that translates into gigantic \\\\nnet savings to small businesses or the economy.\\\\n    At a certain point, you have to, I think, trust that there \\\\nare--that consumers are--have the primary interest in looking \\\\nout for what is best for them and that they can make their own \\\\nchoices, and that DOE doesn&#x27;t need to continually put its thumb \\\\non the scales.\\\\n    So I think, you know, DOE should just declare a victory, \\\\nsay that, yes, you know, mission accomplished and now it is up \\\\nto competitive forces and the economy to determine to what \\\\nextent we prioritize energy efficiency versus other product \\\\nfeatures, qualities, and consumer choices.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Competition always works.\\\\n    Ms. Huey, I am concerned that the Department of Energy is \\\\nprioritizing expensive and burdensome energy efficiency \\\\nstandards, while providing meager efficiency benefits.\\\\n    Distribution transformers you have talked about are a clear \\\\nexample of this. The critical devices are already 99.5 percent \\\\nefficient, and they are hard to come by due to supply chain \\\\npressure.\\\\n    So, question, please tell us how this new rule would impact \\\\nhomebuilders and hurt your industry.\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. We have several areas that have houses that are \\\\nsitting waiting on transformers. I believe in one area of the \\\\ncountry, we have over 4,000 homes that are ready, but--and also \\\\ntime is money, so those houses are costing more. As they are \\\\nsitting there, builders and developers, are paying interest.\\\\n    And then ultimately it comes down to the American consumer \\\\nhaving to wait to buy the American Dream.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Bad timing right now with interest, \\\\nright?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Let me follow-up on that. Given the \\\\nchallenges you just outlined, do you think the Department of \\\\nEnergy appropriately balanced consumer needs and energy \\\\nefficiency when drafting this rule?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. No, sir, I don&#x27;t think so. With the efficiency \\\\nthat there already is, if we could just put a pause on \\\\nincreasing the efficiency right now until we can narrow down \\\\nthe backlog, get rid of the 18- to 24-month waiting period, and \\\\nthen look at the energy efficiency again.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. With what I have remaining, Mr. \\\\nBauman, a few years ago, your company created a new position to \\\\nhelp manage the regulatory burden by the federal government. \\\\nPlease share with us what led your company to make that \\\\ndecision.\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Our company primarily does commercial \\\\nrefrigeration equipment. We have had new standards that came \\\\nout in 2014, additional new standards that have been--or first \\\\ncomes the test procedures, and we--when we looked at what the \\\\ntest procedures, as I mentioned in my testimony, that we are \\\\ninvolved in, which did not--not a lot of small businesses are \\\\nable to do, that we are involved in those many organizations \\\\nthat I mentioned because those are the organizations that write \\\\nthe test procedures.\\\\n    And we have seen test standards that came out previously \\\\nthat were excessive that just, when it came down to it, we had \\\\nto shut down production and development, we had to shut down \\\\nother programs, and we realized a need to really dedicate a lot \\\\nof resources to that effort to get the regulations.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. Quickly, regulatory compliance is \\\\nexpensive, and can you describe quickly what endeavors your \\\\nbusiness has had to forego so that you can keep up with \\\\nchanging regulatory standards.\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. We had a line of freezers that we had to \\\\ndiscontinue. We also have to annually recertify all of our \\\\nproducts with the Department of Energy.\\\\n    We also have, as I mentioned, we built a new test lab, and \\\\nthat was primarily because of the onslaught of numerous energy \\\\nregulations that we had to comply with, and that lab is running \\\\ncontinuously primarily doing energy testing.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. All right. Thank you for that, and I now \\\\nrecognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes of questions.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Bauman, I heard you mention that you have worked with \\\\nthe Office of Advocacy. Is that true?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Yes, we have.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Okay. How has that experience been?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. I would say we have had conversations. In all \\\\nhonesty, we----\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Good? Bad?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Good conversations with some, I will say, some \\\\nof the previous staff. We have had less responses back in \\\\nrecent months.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Okay. This week, we are debating the SBA \\\\nfunding on the floor, and Republicans cut the Office of \\\\nAdvocacy budget by $800 million, yet right now we are \\\\ndiscussing how regulations affect small firms.\\\\n    Does it make sense to cut the budget of an office that \\\\nexists to monitor federal agency regulatory small business \\\\ncompliance, and advocate for small firms? It seems disingenuous \\\\nto me.\\\\n    Professor Hammond, how many years does the Department of \\\\nEnergy typically give small businesses to transition to new \\\\nstandards?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. It gives typically 3 to 5 years with the \\\\nopportunity for an exception for up to an additional 2 more.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. So there is an extension allowed?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. That is right.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. And have small firms utilized this \\\\nextension?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Yes. And those are all published in the \\\\nFederal Register.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Is this enough time to comply, in your \\\\nopinion?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Do any standards apply retroactively?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. No. They all apply in the future.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Okay. Professor, the Energy Policy and \\\\nConservation Act allows DOE to adopt consensus standards that \\\\nwere negotiated by the industry and energy efficiency experts. \\\\nCould you please discuss this option.\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Yes. The agency convened a federal advisory \\\\ncommittee to enable negotiated rulemaking, which is an \\\\nalternative to typical notice-and-comment procedures that \\\\nallows for a consensus-based process, promoting deeper \\\\ncollaboration between the Agency and stakeholders.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. So, the industry is part of the negotiations \\\\nand at the table?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Correct?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. [Nonverbal response.]\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Lewis, CEI&#x27;s testimony failed to mention \\\\nthat DOE was presented with a private consensus agreement for a \\\\nproposed final standard for gas stoves in September 2023. Yes \\\\nor no, are you aware of this agreement?\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. No, I am not.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Okay. Would you support it?\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. I would have to look at it first.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Okay. Professor Hammond, can you discuss the \\\\nprevious administration&#x27;s failure to meet the statutory \\\\ndeadlines under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and why \\\\nDOE is issuing standards more frequently?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Yes. Congress instructed the agency to \\\\nreconsider these standards every 6 years, and the Trump \\\\nadministration didn&#x27;t do what Congress instructed, and it got \\\\nsued. So now DOE is operating under a consent decree where it \\\\nhas to play catch-up, and it has to maintain its regular rhythm \\\\nof review that Congress has set forth.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Professor, there is a tremendous amount of \\\\nmisinformation circulating about DOE&#x27;s appliance standards. Can \\\\nyou discuss the benefits of the new energy efficient standards \\\\nfor small firms?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Yes. Small firms save in a number of ways, and \\\\na number of these ways are itemized in the rulemaking record. \\\\nThey save on energy, and then of course they also save on the \\\\nindirect benefits like the health benefits from reduced air \\\\npollution.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. And knowing that small \\\\nmanufacturers may be disproportionately impacted by the new \\\\nstandards, how does DOE seek out the input of the smallest of \\\\nsmall firms?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. It does a significant amount of research on \\\\nthe front end to make sure it has identified all of the small \\\\nbusinesses that might be impacted, and among other things, it \\\\nreaches out to them individually and offers the opportunity for \\\\na conversation.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Huey, the DOE standards apply to new products and give \\\\nsmall firms 3 to 5 years to comply. Moreover, DOE&#x27;s process \\\\nallows small manufacturers, advocates, and states to work \\\\ntogether to jointly recommend regulations.\\\\n    Given the flexibility built into the process, why doesn&#x27;t \\\\nNAHB work collaboratively with the agency rather than opposing \\\\nregulations that can lower energy bills for homeowners?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. I wouldn&#x27;t say that we were against the \\\\nregulation. We just have such a backlog now that we would like \\\\nto catch up before we implement any new energy efficiency \\\\nstandards for the transformers.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. Thank you very much.\\\\n    And I now recognize Representative Stauber from the great \\\\nState of Minnesota for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair and Ranking \\\\nMember Velazquez, for holding this hearing today, and thank you \\\\nto our witnesses for taking time away from your busy schedules \\\\nto help shed light on this important topic.\\\\n    Today we are here to talk about the devastating effects of \\\\nthe DOE&#x27;s efficiency standards on small businesses and families \\\\nin our districts.\\\\n    These standards are designed to reduce energy consumption \\\\nin our homes and businesses. However, they have had the \\\\nunintended consequence of making our homes less affordable and \\\\nmore expensive to build.\\\\n    Ms. Huey, you mentioned in your testimony that you think \\\\nfederal regulatory agencies should include the, quote, true, \\\\nend quote, cost of the regulations in the rulemaking process. \\\\nCan you expand a bit what you mean by the ``true cost&#x27;&#x27;?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. What I have \\\\ncome to learn in the regulatory rulemaking process here in \\\\nWashington is that agencies are only required to consider the \\\\ndirect cost of crafting new regulations. They don&#x27;t take into \\\\nconsideration sometimes just the waiting time. Time is money.\\\\n    Time that I have to spend waiting for water taps to be \\\\ninstalled, waiting for zoning approval, waiting for permitting, \\\\nall of those sorts of things need to be taken into \\\\nconsideration as well.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. So when we talk about gas furnaces, the \\\\nDepartment of Energy wants to get rid of gas furnaces or change \\\\nthe way they operate.\\\\n    Water heaters. A new water heater, their recommendation is \\\\nto get water heaters that reduce energy. To replace a water \\\\nheater is $2,800.\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. And that is just the water heater. That doesn&#x27;t \\\\ninclude installing the electrical plug for it.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Exactly right.\\\\n    Dishwashers----\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Yes, sir, same.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER.--$225 more.\\\\n    Gas stoves, between $800 and $3,200 it is going to cost the \\\\nAmerican people. Light bulbs, $140 more. Washers, $200. Air \\\\nconditioners, pushing $2,000.\\\\n    And would you believe our federal government wants to \\\\nregulate ceiling fans? Think about the overreach by this \\\\nfederal government.\\\\n    Ms. Huey, these aren&#x27;t my numbers. These are \\\\nadministration&#x27;s numbers. $320 billion--that is with a B--$320 \\\\nbillion of additional regulations on American small businesses \\\\nand manufacturers.\\\\n    What do you--give us an estimate of the cost per household \\\\nif these changes were made. Can the American people afford \\\\nthis?\\\\n    I mean, the government wants to be in every part of our \\\\nlives--ceiling fans, dishwashers, water heaters, light bulbs. \\\\nIt is unbelievable. Give us a cost from the builders, and what \\\\nis their sense?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. And, you know, we are talking about costs for \\\\nsmall businesses, but in my business it is ultimately passed \\\\ndown to the consumer.\\\\n    With the new Energy Codes, the 2021 Energy Codes, that is \\\\nan additional cost of $31,000 to a new home. That is something \\\\nthat a teacher or a firefighter or a nurse cannot afford.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Or a police officer like myself?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Or a police officer, yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. I just--Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair, $31,000 these \\\\nbureaucrats put on somebody that wants to build a new home, not \\\\nthrough Congress, through these three-letter agencies, \\\\nunaccountable, nonelected, to put on the American people.\\\\n    And this is just what you are talking about--$31,000. The \\\\nmedian income in the district that I represent is 60-ish-\\\\nthousand dollars. This is unbelievable.\\\\n    And the interest rates right now, it is simply--it is \\\\nsimply unacceptable. I can&#x27;t imagine what folks are thinking \\\\nwhen the government is telling us what type of water heaters we \\\\ncan use or gas furnaces we need to change, gas stoves--banning \\\\ngas stoves.\\\\n    My 90-year-old father says, what am I going to cook at the \\\\nhunting shack with? It is a gas stove. He has been doing it for \\\\n60 years.\\\\n    This is overreach, Mr. Chair, by our federal government, in \\\\nevery aspect of our lives, complete overreach, and it is \\\\nunacceptable. I think the American people have had it, and I \\\\nyield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Golden from the great State \\\\nof Maine for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Professor Hammond, I really only have two questions, I \\\\nbelieve. I reserve the right for follow-ups, but by all means, \\\\ntake your time and answer them as best you can.\\\\n    You mentioned in your opening testimony that the Agency \\\\ndoes a good job of speaking in very plain terms to businesses \\\\nto help them understand new regulations and compliance, and I \\\\nam hoping you can treat the committee the same way here and not \\\\nassume that we are deep in the weeds.\\\\n    If you were to hand us some kind of blueprint, like a one-\\\\npager, that would tell us a little bit about the process that \\\\nDOE conducts to do outreach to small businesses as part of the \\\\nrulemaking process, what would it show us? What concrete steps? \\\\nIf you could be, you know, detailed.\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. It would show a very--a years&#x27; long process to \\\\nnot only develop the standards themselves but also the test \\\\nprocedures that come before the standards.\\\\n    These begin with Requests for Information--which are widely \\\\nextended and as well as published in the Federal Register--the \\\\ndevelopment of technical support documents, webinars, and then \\\\nspecific research to identify particular small businesses who \\\\nmay be impacted, to seek them out directly. And that is all \\\\nbefore a rulemaking is even proposed.\\\\n    Once it is proposed, it goes through that process again. It \\\\nworks with the Office of Advocacy as well to make sure that it \\\\nis properly considering the interests of small businesses, and \\\\nagain----\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. You bring specific industry, small business \\\\nowners in and actually sit around the table with them?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Well, yes. For example, I am aware that \\\\nyesterday DOE hosted a public meeting on the commercial \\\\nrefrigeration standards.\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. Okay. And how--could you describe, like, \\\\nattendance? What is the update?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. I haven&#x27;t checked on the attendance yesterday. \\\\nThe ones that I previously participated in were very well \\\\nattended.\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. Thank you. So kind of moving on from there, how \\\\noften do you think that input is received and then acted upon \\\\nsuch that between a proposal and a final rule, changes are \\\\nactually made that incorporate what small businesses have given \\\\nback to DOE?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Very often. It is extremely common for the \\\\nAgency to adjust its final rule in response to all of the input \\\\nit received during the proposed rule.\\\\n    And I should note that a number of the standards we are \\\\ntalking about today are proposed standards, so there is still \\\\nan opportunity for lots of engagement with the Agency, and it \\\\nindeed will address those comments.\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. Are there any specific examples that you can \\\\nrecall in your own time in the Department where you saw that \\\\nprocess play out and changes made and incorporated?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. I--yes. And of course I was serving as \\\\ncounsel, so I--I will maybe not be quite as detailed, but I \\\\nwill say an example is for the general standard--the general \\\\nservice lamp, the light bulb standard which, of course, \\\\nCongress directed the agency to undertake.\\\\n    And the Agency considered all of the feedback of \\\\nbusinesses, and it developed a different enforcement timeline \\\\nto provide even further a glide path to make sure that people \\\\nhad a chance to be ready for the standard going into effect.\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. Sure. And finally in your testimony you \\\\nmentioned Congress built in a relief valve for small \\\\nbusinesses. Can you talk a little bit about the flexibility \\\\nthat that affords the Agency and small businesses? And can you \\\\nthink of any examples where that has actually been utilized?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. I don&#x27;t have a concrete example right at hand, \\\\nbut essentially this is written into the statute, and the \\\\nDepartment has very clear guidance on its website about what a \\\\nsmall business would need to do.\\\\n    Once a small business does present a request, then that is \\\\npublished in the Federal Register, and assuming it is granted, \\\\nthat is also published in the Federal Register. So it is----\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. Is that like a specific waiver request from one \\\\nbusiness or is it----\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. Okay. So it is not a broad waiver across an \\\\nentire industry?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. That is right. A small business can take \\\\nadvantage of that.\\\\n    For the test procedures, there is also a waiver process \\\\navailable, and that relates to the procedures themselves and \\\\nthe technology.\\\\n    Mr. GOLDEN. All right. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Alford from the great State \\\\nof Missouri for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Ranking \\\\nMember Velazquez. Thank you to all of our witnesses here today. \\\\nI know you come here on your own dime and own time, and we \\\\nreally appreciate that.\\\\n    Hey, this is a very important hearing for us for a couple \\\\nof reasons. You know, the past few months, we have all seen the \\\\nnews about the Department of Energy--or I think I am going to \\\\nrename it the department of encroachment now--and their new \\\\nenergy efficiency rules.\\\\n    And now we are really learning the impact that it is going \\\\nto have on our businesses and our American families.\\\\n    The Biden-Harris administration time and time again, I \\\\nthink, fails to consider the impact of these erroneous over-\\\\nregulations, what it is going to have on our homebuilders, our \\\\nfamilies, and our businesses.\\\\n    If we do not champion main street interests, then we will \\\\nlose the small businesses that are part of the fabric of \\\\nAmerica, and a contributing factor to the closure of small \\\\nbusiness is the current regulatory environment.\\\\n    Ms. Huey, I want to start with you if I can, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    In your testimony you said regulatory burdens account for \\\\n25 percent of the cost of a typical newly built home. I just \\\\ngave up my real estate license, sold new homes actually in the \\\\nKansas City area for many years.\\\\n    The average or median price there for a home is $270,000. \\\\nThat would bump it up to $337,500. And when you consider the \\\\ninterest rates now that, especially younger folks, new families \\\\nare trying to get into homes, it seems like the Biden \\\\nadministration does not believe in the American Dream.\\\\n    It is trying to kill the American Dream, the American Dream \\\\nof homeownership, moving our society from owners into renters.\\\\n    I have had conversations with Will Ruder, the president of \\\\nour local Home Builders Association there in Kansas City. He \\\\nsays the exact same thing, that this 25 percent increase is \\\\ngoing to drive people out of the Kansas City area and into \\\\nplaces that are not having to conduct, because of other \\\\nregulations--the Kansas City Council is imposing on Building \\\\nCodes there, but it is a monstrous really burden that people \\\\nare having to pay to get into the American Dream of \\\\nhomeownership.\\\\n    How do you see this playing out long-term for builders? How \\\\ndid they keep building when the Biden administration keeps \\\\nputting a foot on their neck?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. It does make it extremely more difficult because \\\\nwe have federal, state, and regulations all to follow.\\\\n    It is noted that NAHB illustrates that for every $1,000 \\\\nincrease in the price of a median home, which is about \\\\n$425,700, that prices out 140,436 households out of the \\\\nmarket--for every $1,000 increase in the price of a house.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Well, when you consider this--and this is \\\\ngetting off into another topic, I realize it, but investment \\\\ncompanies like BlackRock that are also investing in build-to-\\\\nrent communities--we have seen that in the Kansas City area--\\\\nwhere they are building entire neighborhoods of rental homes \\\\nthat look like regular, single-family homes, and they are, but \\\\nthey are like apartments.\\\\n    And you know what else, it is a lot easier to get people \\\\ninto rentals and apartments especially. You can ballot harvest \\\\na lot easier in an apartment than you can walking a single-\\\\nfamily neighborhood.\\\\n    It is scary what is happening to the American Dream, and I \\\\napplaud you and the homebuilders of America who are trying to \\\\nmake that dream possible and affordable for the American \\\\npeople. I am running out of time.\\\\n    Mr. Lewis, in your testimony, you mentioned the RFA&#x27;s and \\\\nlack of Agency&#x27;s willingness to take it seriously. Please talk \\\\nabout how we can better utilize or improve the RFA so we can \\\\nuse it as effective tool rather than just a check box.\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Yes. Well, one thing that--oh, sorry, the mike \\\\nagain. Yeah. I mean, the agencies have flexibility--they get \\\\nflexibility in determining what is a significant impact or what \\\\nis a substantial number of small entities.\\\\n    So I would think that maybe tightening up or clarifying \\\\nthose definitions. Like I was just trying to think--I was \\\\ntalking to my colleague on the way over here and kicking some \\\\nideas around, and what is a significant impact, it seems to me, \\\\nwould be relative to the profit margin of the business that is \\\\naffected.\\\\n    And so maybe there could be some standard that will be \\\\nadopted that would say, you know, for the industrywide \\\\naverage----\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Sir, we are out of time. I am sorry.\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Okay.\\\\n    --the regulation cannot cost more than, say, 3 percent of \\\\nyour profit margin. I mean, that might be an idea.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. I like that idea.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative McGarvey from the great \\\\nState of Kentucky for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for \\\\nbeing here today.\\\\n    Thank you, Professor Hammond. I want to especially thank \\\\nyou for highlighting some of the contributions of our civil \\\\nservants who do a really good job in trying to do the best they \\\\ncan for all of us in this country.\\\\n    I am going to repeat a little bit of myself from one of the \\\\nprevious hearings we had in this committee, and that is, we are \\\\nhere to talk about regulations. We care about how regulations \\\\nimpact people and how they impact businesses.\\\\n    And that well written and well executed regulations are \\\\nimportant--they save lives. They save money. They save money \\\\nfor our government. They save money for our consumers. They \\\\nalso can save our planet--and I want to go to these specific \\\\nstandards as an example of that.\\\\n    The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy \\\\nestimates that efficiency standards for appliances and lighting \\\\nwould save the average Kentuckian, where I am from, an \\\\nestimated 15 percent of their annual bill.\\\\n    This isn&#x27;t surprising. I see in my own home, which was \\\\nbuilt in the late 1920s, early 1930s, the importance of having \\\\nenergy-efficient items.\\\\n    The DOE estimates that by 2030, cumulative savings from all \\\\nstandards in effect since 1987 will reach nearly $2 trillion.\\\\n    So I want to go back and, Professor Hammond, I want to \\\\nstart with you, in part because I am a recovering lawyer and I \\\\nhave always wanted to ask a law professor a question instead of \\\\nhaving them ask me a question.\\\\n    But the administration is required by law to issue these \\\\nregulations, correct?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. And it is a result of a court decision from \\\\nthe Trump administration not issuing these regulations that is \\\\nrequiring them to not just issue the regulations but to have to \\\\nplay catch-up for what the Trump administration didn&#x27;t do in \\\\nthe 4 years it was in office?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Okay. So these are required by law, and \\\\nobviously this committee is not suggesting that the \\\\nadministration break the law. So let&#x27;s talk about what these \\\\nstandards are doing.\\\\n    And it has been shown that the standards we are examining \\\\ntoday will help benefit small businesses and save them money in \\\\nthe long run.\\\\n    Again, we care about small businesses. Small businesses are \\\\nthe backbone of my community in Louisville, Kentucky. We want \\\\nthem to succeed and thrive and do well.\\\\n    So how do these standards benefit the broader economy and \\\\nthe country, including small business, small business \\\\nemployees, and those who do business with them?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. In a number of ways. There is, of course, the \\\\ndirect benefit, which is lower energy bills, and I should note, \\\\nlower water bills too for some of the standards.\\\\n    So that is a direct impact that is true for a business that \\\\nis using any of these appliances or equipment, as well as the \\\\nhomeowners or householders who also use them in the house and \\\\nalso work at small businesses.\\\\n    Then of course there are the broader impacts, like the \\\\nhealth benefits and the climate benefits that I mentioned.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you. Okay. So kind of just reframing \\\\nthis again, the court has said the administration has to issue \\\\nthese. They have to issue more because the Trump administration \\\\ndidn&#x27;t do it.\\\\n    They can be helpful, but we want to make sure they are \\\\nhelpful to small businesses. Is there a process by which the \\\\nadministration is considering the needs of small businesses? Do \\\\nthey have community engagement sessions? Must they take into \\\\nconsideration any of these comments in the proposed rule?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Yes. First of all, to answer your final \\\\nquestion, they are required by law to respond--not just \\\\nconsider but respond--to significant comments raised, and of \\\\ncourse the overall process is very much designed to consider \\\\ninterests of all stakeholders but particularly small \\\\nbusinesses.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you. And when they find a legitimate \\\\nconcern, how do they work to address it?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. They work first to just understand what it is \\\\nand make sure that they have thoroughly considered the issue. \\\\nThey look to see whether there are adjustments to be made and \\\\nhow those trade off against the other factors that Congress \\\\nrequired the Agency to consider.\\\\n    So it is very much a case-by-case decision, but those \\\\ncomments do have an impact.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you, Professor, I appreciate that \\\\nbecause, again, we want to make sure that our small businesses \\\\nare being heard, that they are being represented, that these \\\\nregulations make sense for them. So I appreciate that very \\\\nmuch.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Van Duyne from the great \\\\nState of Texas for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    This hearing today is one of tremendous importance. With \\\\nAmericans suffering under 3 years of disastrous policies from \\\\nthe Biden administration that have been painfully driving up \\\\ncost of living.\\\\n    It has made food, electricity, housing, and transportation \\\\nimpossible to afford, and it has made new homeownership an \\\\nimpossibly distant dream for many young Americans.\\\\n    Now we need to deal with a reckless agenda from the \\\\nDepartment of Energy, pushing overreaching energy-efficiency \\\\nrules that will burden small manufacturers.\\\\n    Earlier this year, this committee passed my bill, the Small \\\\nBusiness Regulatory Reduction Act, which requires the Small \\\\nBusiness Administration to ensure, for each fiscal year, the \\\\ncost to small businesses of the administration&#x27;s rulemaking is \\\\nnot greater than zero, and while also requiring the SBA to \\\\nissue a report on any regulations issued by other federal \\\\nagencies that impact small businesses.\\\\n    And I am looking to expand this to obviously the Department \\\\nof Energy now, and I think it is a perfect place to start.\\\\n    This hearing is a great example of why my bill is \\\\nnecessary, and which is to ensure Congress is reigning in the \\\\npower of out-of-control, regulatory, glutton executive branch. \\\\nAnd I look forward to continuing to work with the committee to \\\\nsee my bill move forward and to work to strengthen small \\\\nbusinesses across the country.\\\\n    We just heard testimony on, in answers to some of the \\\\nquestions, that said that these regulations benefit small \\\\nbusinesses.\\\\n    Mr. Bauman, I want to ask you--you work for a small \\\\nbusiness--how often do you guys Go, Oh, goody, we got more \\\\nregulations, these are going to benefit us?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. We don&#x27;t--it hurt us, as I said, from the \\\\nproduct side, our competitiveness and ability to offer--\\\\ninnovate products and work along those lines versus we are \\\\ntaking time to address regulations to meet with and--as Ms. \\\\nHammond mentioned, we were in a meeting yesterday with DOE in \\\\nregards to commercial refrigeration equipment, and I was there. \\\\nI was basically the only small business. There were a few \\\\nothers, there were a handful, but a lot of small businesses \\\\ndon&#x27;t have the opportunity like we have invested in to do that. \\\\nSo it has absolutely been a burden. And the other----\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. So this is going to cost small businesses \\\\nmoney?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Yes, yes.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. But we just heard about all of these cost \\\\nsavings that they were going to have. Do you actually see that? \\\\nI mean, there is one thing to say that that is going to happen \\\\non paper, but in reality do you see that that is happening?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. We do not see that happening. It continues to \\\\nbe a burden on our sales and on our manufacturing.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. So you have got increased inflation as well, \\\\nand that is being coupled with increased federal regulations. \\\\nHas that made it more difficult for your business to grow?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Yes, it has. We are privately owned. We are \\\\nvery short-term borrowers. We try to not do a lot of \\\\ninvestments that we can&#x27;t afford to invest ourselves. But, \\\\nyeah, there is all different types of capital expenditures that \\\\nare harsh on our business.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. And, Ms. Huey, I am going to ask you the \\\\nsame question. I mean, do your home builders--are they excited \\\\nwith these new regulations? Do they see all of the cost savings \\\\nthat we have heard are going to come? Are they actually seeing \\\\nthat in reality?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Yeah, no. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    As I talked about earlier, one-quarter of the cost of new \\\\nconstruction of a single-family home is government regulations, \\\\nand that is at all levels. For me I looked back at a house I \\\\nbuilt recently. I spent $35,000 before I ever started building \\\\nthe house. That was permit--building permit, land disturbance \\\\npermit, water tap, sewer tap, driveway permit, gravel, silt \\\\nfence. All of those add up before I ever really started \\\\nbuilding the house.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. What State?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Alabama.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. In Alabama. So be happy that you are not \\\\nbuilding in California because pre-pandemic it was 40 percent \\\\nregulatory costs.\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Yes, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. But, you know, have you found that in your \\\\nincreased inflation as well, coupled with increased \\\\nregulations, has that made it difficult for you to grow your \\\\nbusiness?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. It has. And it is difficult for the consumers. \\\\nThey don&#x27;t understand that when I give them a price of what--\\\\nthat estimate of what their house is going to be and then when \\\\nthose estimates grow because of things like fuel surcharge, you \\\\nknow, in the last couple of years that we have had. Now I \\\\nunderstand the fuel prices are down, but in the last couple of \\\\nyears they were up. So it is things like that that added on to \\\\nthe top that we didn&#x27;t expect.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. So you are saying that not only are these \\\\nregulations overburdensome and harmful to small businesses, but \\\\nyou are saying actually people who want to buy homes are also \\\\naffected negatively by this?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Absolutely.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. So how much more have homes cost in the last \\\\n3 years, if you could, in Alabama or anywhere in the country?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. I know that in the last couple of years, one \\\\npoint of reference I have is during the pandemic--and I know \\\\nthat we are not talking about lumber prices, but our lumber \\\\npackage went from $35,000 to $125,000, and it settled somewhere \\\\naround $75,000.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Well, I would look forward to hearing if you \\\\nguys have any solutions. I know typically what I hear is we \\\\njust want the government to stay out of our business. That was \\\\nthe best way to help it grow.\\\\n    I appreciate you guys being here. And I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Chu from the great State of \\\\nCalifornia for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. While those on the other side of the aisle are \\\\ntrying to make it sound like the Biden administration decided \\\\nto just do rulemaking on its own, but let me emphasize this is \\\\nthe law. And the Department of Energy is required by law to \\\\nevaluate energy efficiency standards for various products and \\\\nappliances every 6 years. Once an updated standard is \\\\npublished, small businesses get 3 years to comply and get an \\\\nextra 2 years&#x27; grace period before they have to come into \\\\ncompliance. So that is 5 years total to do so. And let&#x27;s not \\\\nforget that these standards only apply to newly manufactured \\\\nproducts, not to existing products that consumers already \\\\nowned.\\\\n    We also heard from Professor Hammond&#x27;s testimony that there \\\\nis ample opportunity for small businesses&#x27; and small \\\\nmanufacturers&#x27; concerns to be considered at every step of the \\\\ndepartment&#x27;s process when they decide how to update a \\\\nparticular standard. And, in fact, she said that the department \\\\neven goes further than what is required, offering webinars and \\\\nconducting other types of direct outreach to small business \\\\nstakeholders. So, actually, the Biden administration is going \\\\nabove and beyond to consider small business voices in the \\\\nrulemaking.\\\\n    Actually, we are in this situation because the previous \\\\nadministration missed scores of deadlines violating the \\\\nrequirements in the law. And, in addition, there was a lawsuit \\\\nover the previous administration&#x27;s failure to meet the \\\\nstandards. It was settled, and the settlement was that the DOE \\\\nwas required to review these regulations.\\\\n    So, Professor Hammond, can you explain why the Department \\\\nof Energy is being required to issue so many new standards now \\\\nand give an example of how this benefits small businesses?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Sure. As you described, it is required to do \\\\nso many now because it has its existing statutory obligations, \\\\nplus the backlog that now a court is enforcing that it has to \\\\ncomply with.\\\\n    And then in terms of the kinds of benefits, these benefits \\\\ncan be for all kinds of small businesses. We are not just \\\\ntalking about manufacturers here. We are talking about all \\\\nsmall businesses. It is the convenience store owner. It is the \\\\nperson who has the restaurant or cooks out of their home. Any \\\\nnumber of businesses who use appliances are going to be saving \\\\non their bills because of these standards.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Well, let&#x27;s talk about one particular appliance \\\\nbecause there is so much misinformation about the proposed gas \\\\nstove standards. The Department of Energy is not proposing to \\\\nban gas cooking products any more than it is trying to ban \\\\nlight bulbs.\\\\n    Does the DOE even have the authority to ban gas stoves?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. No, it doesn&#x27;t.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. When would these proposed standards for gas stoves \\\\ngo into effect? And, by the way, can you explain what the \\\\nstandard is now?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Well, I will mention that the proposed rules, \\\\nthey are not even finalized yet, so they will still benefit \\\\nfrom input, the types of which we are hearing today. The \\\\nproposed rules are not just for gas stoves. They are for gas \\\\nand electric stoves as the department is required to do. And \\\\nthey will go into effect, I think it is 3 to 5 years from when \\\\nthe rule is final. I just want to note, those are future-\\\\nlooking for new stoves. It has nothing to say about what \\\\nhappens for people who already have gas stoves.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. And, in fact, the DOE does not have the authority \\\\nto take products out of consumers&#x27; homes or small businesses. \\\\nIs that correct?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Absolutely.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Now, can you also give us an example of where the \\\\nDOE did a review and maybe cite a standard that the DOE decided \\\\nnot to update because it did not meet the criteria?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. One that comes to mind is space heaters. DOE \\\\ndecided not to set efficiency standards for those. So it does \\\\nlook at these and decide whether it is called for under the \\\\nstatutory requirements.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. So the process works, and the DOE is not \\\\noverreaching. Correct?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. That is right.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. And let me ask also about the particular savings \\\\nthat the average American household is saving, because it is \\\\nnot just small businesses. It is every American that is saving \\\\non their utility bills. Can you talk more about that?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Sure. And that is true. All of these rules \\\\nhave to be cost justified. That means the costs have to be \\\\noutweighed by the benefits, and DOE published those \\\\ntransparently for everyone to see. The deLaski and Mauer study \\\\nthat I cite in my written testimony provides State-by-State \\\\nanalyses of benefits not just to businesses but also to \\\\nconsumers.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Meuser from the great State \\\\nof Pennsylvania for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate it very much. \\\\nThank you very much to our witnesses.\\\\n    So we just heard--and I say this in all due respect--how \\\\nwonderful the DOE&#x27;s regulations and rulemaking is and how \\\\npositive it must be for small business.\\\\n    Mr. Lewis, do you find that from gas stoves to other rules \\\\nbeing made that that has been beneficial to the industry that \\\\nyou are familiar with?\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Well, I don&#x27;t have much industry specific \\\\nexperience, but I will say that--mike. Oh, sorry, the mike.\\\\n    I can&#x27;t----\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Well, Competitive Enterprise Institute, you \\\\nmust--that deals with businesses. Right?\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Yes, that&#x27;s right. But, in other words, we \\\\ndon&#x27;t--we are not spokespersons for any particular industry. My \\\\ncolleague, Ben Lieberman, who was supposed to testify, actually \\\\ndoes have much more contact with industry experts. I wish he \\\\nwere here.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. And I will move on down the line. Ms. Huey.\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. But if I could----\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Yeah, go ahead.\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Yeah. But if I could mention, you know, some of \\\\nthese costs are in the form of degraded performance. Like many \\\\npeople complain that the dishwasher has to be run twice in \\\\norder to get the dishes clean, that clothes washers now, they \\\\nare so efficient in their use of, say, water that you have to \\\\nwash the clothes twice.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Right.\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. And we actually had an ad back a few years ago \\\\nwhich was billed ``Send Your Underpants to the \\\\nUndersecretary,&#x27;&#x27; because a lot of people were complaining that \\\\nthey had to run the same load twice.\\\\n    So those are costs that the agency is really not terribly \\\\nconcerned about.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Good. Great points.\\\\n    And if they actually were to talk with stakeholders, as we \\\\nare hearing, that the overreach is just phenomenal--you know, I \\\\nwas in business for nearly 25 years. And, Mr. Bauman, I want to \\\\nask you, when you all have improved air-conditioners, when you \\\\nmake air-conditioners more efficient, you make them less cost, \\\\nyou make them utilize less energy, did any of that come from a \\\\nmandate or a rule from the government?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. No. We----\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. It is laughable. Right?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Yeah. We look at what the regulations are, but \\\\nin the air-conditioning and on the refrigeration side, we are \\\\nbecause of the competitive market----\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. You make it better?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Right.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. So your customers--so it costs them less, so \\\\nthey are using less fuel, so as they are cooling the area in \\\\nthe best manner and most effective way possible. It is called \\\\nAmerican innovation. It is called entrepreneurship. Would you \\\\ncall it government rulemaking and mandates?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. I would say the innovation is where we--not the \\\\nmandates, but having products that are innovative and, again, \\\\nprimarily that are providing refrigeration for safe food or \\\\nthose that really are providing safety and comfort.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. And, Chairman, I am sorry I sound a little \\\\nsarcastic, but it is a little hard to take.\\\\n    So, Ms. Huey, I would like to ask you a couple of questions \\\\non the transformer issue that you spoke about in your testimony \\\\nand the shortage that exists and the Department of Energy now \\\\nsubmitting that it needs to have some new standards for these \\\\ntransformers, and yet they have gone through all kinds of \\\\nefficiency measures over the last several years.\\\\n    Do you want to just speak on that a little bit further, \\\\nplease?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Yes. So as we have talked about, they are \\\\nalready, you know, like 97.9 percent energy efficient, and we \\\\nare only increasing the efficiency by 1/10 of a percent while \\\\nwe have an 18- to 24-month backlog of people that need them, \\\\nthe houses that are sitting. I think it is in the Houston area \\\\nthere is about 4,000 houses that are sitting. And then recently \\\\nthe tornadoes that ripped through Mississippi, I think there \\\\nwas about 400 transformers that were torn out there. So it only \\\\nadds to the backlog and the time.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Sure. Has your industry been in--has the DOE \\\\nbeen in contact with you folks and said, Hey, what do you think \\\\nabout this action? Give us some input. We are very interested \\\\nin whether or not we should pursue this.\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. We did participate in the SBA&#x27;s advocacy. We had \\\\nover 60 of our builders that were part of a round table \\\\ndiscussion, and they expressed all of their concerns. It will \\\\nbe very interesting to see if the DOE will heed those concerns.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Okay. So you haven&#x27;t had a response yet?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. No.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. You have only had the original rule, so nothing \\\\nhas been affected or changed as of yet?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. That is my understanding, yes.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Okay. Well, maybe we can help you follow up on \\\\nthat with them and see because, in the end, we are interested \\\\nin reasonable initiatives. However, at this point in time, you \\\\nthink the current rule is quite unreasonable for your industry?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Right now because we have a backlog I do believe \\\\nthat it is, yes.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Okay.\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. When you think about the energy efficiency that \\\\nwe already have in homes right now and in the transformers, to \\\\ngo another step when we have such a backlog and the American \\\\ndream is unaffordable and unattainable for so many.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. All right. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Scholten from the great \\\\nState of Michigan for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. And thank you \\\\nto all of our witnesses for coming here today. Your testimony \\\\nis incredibly enlightening. This is such an important topic.\\\\n    My district is home to a very large portion of the Grand \\\\nRiver Watershed, the largest river in the State of Michigan. \\\\nAnd we also represent miles of beautiful Lake Michigan \\\\nshoreline, the Great Lakes region multibillion dollar economy. \\\\nI am very serious about protecting these natural resources, not \\\\nonly for their inherent worth, but what they contribute to our \\\\neconomy.\\\\n    That being said, there is nothing more frustrating to a \\\\nwest Michigan small business owner than regulations that do \\\\nnothing and just stand in their way, impede their business and \\\\ndon&#x27;t even do what they purport to do.\\\\n    My colleagues on this committee know that I have been the \\\\nfirst among Democrats many times to push back against \\\\nunnecessary regulations. But one of the things that I want to \\\\ntalk about today is the process that the department goes \\\\nthrough to make sure that these regulations are doing what they \\\\nintend to do.\\\\n    And so I have two questions for you, Professor Hammond. I \\\\nam wondering if you can explain how the Department of Energy&#x27;s \\\\ncurrent rulemaking process takes into consideration the \\\\npriorities of small businesses and consumers and what DOE does \\\\nto ensure that regulations are cost-effective and not overly \\\\nburdensome for consumers--or for businesses. Excuse me. Yeah, \\\\nthank you.\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Sure. So the process itself has that seven-\\\\nfactor analysis that Congress required, and that looks at both \\\\ncosts and benefits to consumers, to manufacturers. And then, of \\\\ncourse, DOE further evaluates specifically the interests of \\\\nsmall businesses in that process. It always has to be cost \\\\njustified.\\\\n    And then further--I am sorry. Could you just remind me of \\\\nyour second question?\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Yeah. So how is the DOE ensuring that these \\\\nregulations are cost-effective and not overly burdensome for \\\\nsmall businesses? What is the process beyond maybe those seven \\\\nsteps?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. It also complies, of course, with Executive \\\\nOrder 12866, and it does a cost-benefit analysis that is \\\\nreviewed both by OIRA. It collects interagency comments on, \\\\nagain, not just the proposed rules but also the final rules, \\\\nand for many of the standards we are talking about today, they \\\\nare still just proposed.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Okay. Thank you so much.\\\\n    And what&#x27;s your impression of that process, the feedback \\\\nloop that happens and the consideration that is taken in? You \\\\nknow, are small businesses being heard when they weigh in about \\\\nhow that would impact their business?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. They are. My experience is that the agency \\\\ntakes small business feedback very seriously and thinks long \\\\nand hard about how these standards will affect those \\\\nbusinesses.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you.\\\\n    My second question is, you know, I hear so much from \\\\nconstituents who regard regulations as unnecessary government \\\\nintervention in the market. Can you explain how regulations \\\\naround energy conservation standards actually serve to bolster \\\\ninnovation and positively impact the economy?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. Sure. And I want to say maybe two things about \\\\nthe EPCA standards. The first is that these are national \\\\nstandards to avoid additional costs that manufacturers would \\\\nhave to comply with if they had to go State by State for \\\\nvarious standards. So there is an efficiency built in right \\\\nthere. And they push innovation. Typically the standards do \\\\napply in a way that already there are existing products on the \\\\nmarket, but it allows new entrants to the market and invites \\\\ninnovation to even push forward.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you so much.\\\\n    Yield back the remainder of my time.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Molinaro from the great \\\\nState of New York for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Although great State \\\\nof New York, it may not be the right moniker for the purposes \\\\nof this hearing as New York has created--made a science and art \\\\nform of overregulating even the most basic behaviors.\\\\n    I came at the right moment. I take no--I don&#x27;t want to take \\\\nmuch issue, but, you know, uniformity of regulation is nice and \\\\nefficiencies to achieve that. It might come out of uniformity \\\\nof regulation, but we live in a Republican democracy, and in \\\\nthat form of government, the States have certain \\\\nresponsibilities, the federal government has certain \\\\nresponsibilities. And we are not supposed to tread on those. \\\\nAnd small businesses in particular, they understand the burden, \\\\nthe challenge of overregulation.\\\\n    I have often said, having spent the last 30 years in both \\\\nState and local government, that when it comes to federal \\\\nregulation or federal government, not only doesn&#x27;t the federal \\\\ngovernment know what the left--the right hand doesn&#x27;t know what \\\\nthe left hand is doing. In the federal government, sometimes \\\\nthe left hand doesn&#x27;t even know there is a right hand.\\\\n    And that overburdensome bureaucracy, if you will, that \\\\nlabyrinth of regulation adds enormous burden, pressure, \\\\ncompliance concerns, and costs to small businesses. And so I \\\\nhappen to think that we ought to expect greater consolidation \\\\nof regulation. We ought to demand greater transparency, and \\\\nthere needs to be better understanding by the small business \\\\nowners in particular as to what regulation they are to follow, \\\\nwhen, how, and what the impact is to them.\\\\n    And so to that end, I joined in introducing the POST It Act \\\\nwhich requires federal agencies to post guidance on rules that \\\\nwill have significant impact on small businesses. I represent \\\\nsmall communities all across Upstate New York. Small business \\\\nis, as it is across America, the engine of economic opportunity \\\\nin our community. 70 percent of new jobs created by existing \\\\nsmall business, they are overburdened.\\\\n    To that end, Mr. Marlo Lewis, I want to just get your take \\\\nand opinion on the necessity of the POST It Act, the benefit it \\\\nmight provide, and how small businesses might be helped should \\\\nit be adopted.\\\\n    Mr. LEWIS. Yes. This is a straight-up transparency and \\\\naccountability reform. It is almost unbelievable that anyone \\\\nwould oppose this or that the access to regulatory guidance \\\\nwasn&#x27;t already readily available. It was for a period under the \\\\nTrump administration that we have heard so much about, but the \\\\nBiden administration, one of its first moves in the regulatory \\\\nsphere was to repeal the requirement that every agency provide \\\\na portal with a database, a searchable database so that \\\\nbusinesses could find out what guidance documents--and there \\\\nare literally thousands of them--apply to them and that they \\\\nmust know in order in turn to comply with regulations.\\\\n    So we are all behind your bill. We think it is great and it \\\\nis long overdue. And we are also flabbergasted that it is even \\\\nnecessary.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Yeah, I thought you might say that. And not \\\\nonly is it important for transparency purposes, but the lack of \\\\ntransparency allows the federal government and, by extension, \\\\nState governments to enforce without either understanding or \\\\nthe ability by small businesses to effectively react or even \\\\nprevent such enforcement.\\\\n    Ms. Huey, I wanted to--because I only have a minute left. I \\\\njust wanted to acknowledge, in your testimony you talk a little \\\\nbit about recent efforts by the DOE to use the rulemaking \\\\nprocess to limit consumer access to residential gas stoves. New \\\\nYork has already taken such an action, which for me, you know, \\\\nI come from a part of the country where, by the way, the modern \\\\nday environmental movement was born in the Hudson River Valley. \\\\nI get it. We understand the value of both environmental \\\\nprotection and addressing climate change. However, the policy \\\\nis misguided, and it does focus a heavy bureaucracy on a \\\\nfragile industry and overtaxed individuals. And I did join in \\\\nopposing Governor Hochul&#x27;s proposed ban and requiring the \\\\nfederal government to evaluate the actual costs of such a ban \\\\nto small businesses.\\\\n    Could you just speak quickly about how the DOE&#x27;s proposed \\\\nrule on gas stoves might affect your business and, by \\\\nextension, customers?\\\\n    Ms. HUEY. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    I recently built a home for a customer that cooked, loved \\\\nto cook. When we walked through the house at the rough-in, she \\\\nsaid, I guess we need to add an electrical plug because they \\\\nare going to come and take my gas stove. She really said that \\\\nto me. And she said, And I guess we need to put one upstairs \\\\nfor the hot water heater too. And I said, No, ma&#x27;am, they are \\\\nnot going to come take it out of your house.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Chairman, I just would add, this is \\\\nprecisely why we need the transparency. I yield with we have \\\\nconsumers that are unduly burdened and worried that the federal \\\\ngovernment is looking around their kitchen tables.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you very much. The gentleman \\\\nyields back.\\\\n    I now represent Representative Gluesenkamp from the great \\\\nState of Washington for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    And I think I know the answer to this. And I want to say I \\\\nsincerely appreciate the witnesses. I know you all pay your own \\\\nway to be here. I really appreciate that you are here. But do \\\\nany of you--have any you of you--none of you currently work as \\\\ntechnicians fixing appliances. Correct? Have any of you been \\\\ntechnicians?\\\\n    Okay. Thank you to the committee staff who ensured that \\\\nsomeone on the panel has worked actually fixing appliances, \\\\nbecause I think that is a critical piece that has been missing \\\\nfrom this discussion.\\\\n    I want to say that I appreciate the department&#x27;s statutory \\\\nobligation to review the standards, but I am deeply concerned \\\\nwhy these washing machines can play Tchaikovsky, but they only \\\\nlast 2 years now. And it is something that--you know, they say \\\\nthere is lies, damn lies, and statistics. And I am very \\\\nconcerned about the horizon.\\\\n    So, Professor Hammond, I don&#x27;t know if you know the answer \\\\nto this, but when they do these cost-benefit analysis, like, \\\\nhow do they reflect back the durability of an appliance? And \\\\nwhat&#x27;s the horizon that they are expected to last?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. They do consider the lifetime of the \\\\nappliance. And, of course, that varies by appliance. I will say \\\\nthey also consider the efficacy. I know they just did a test \\\\nprocedure for dishwashers to ensure that there is a washability \\\\nstandard there too.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Do you know what the timeline--like, \\\\nhow many years are they expected to last?\\\\n    Ms. HAMMOND. I would have to go look for which specific \\\\nappliances we are talking about, but sometimes, you know, 10 to \\\\n12 years.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Because every time I am driving \\\\naround I see these front-loading washing machines out on the \\\\nstreet, you know, and it is a huge environmental impact, and it \\\\nis a huge cost to consumers and small businesses to have \\\\nappliances that do not last anymore. Like, my washing machine \\\\nis from 2003. My fridge is from 1997. You know, like, the old \\\\nstuff can last if we support it. But often we are seeing a huge \\\\nexplosion in the number of chips involved in any given \\\\nappliance. Everything is made out of plastic now. I, you know, \\\\nwork on cars. Right? Like, the quality of parts is very, very \\\\nconcerning to me, of components within them. And so that is \\\\nwhat I am--you know, I think these standards can be useful, but \\\\nI am very, very concerned the horizon under which they are \\\\nconsidered.\\\\n    So I had a question for Mr. Bauman. I understand that you \\\\nhave an obligation to abide by these standards, and you have \\\\nexpressed concerns today about this process and its impact on \\\\nyour business. But I am also curious and thinking about how we \\\\nmake sure that manufacturers, like, are prioritizing \\\\ndurability.\\\\n    What is the thing--like, what can we do to put more \\\\npressure on increasing the life cycle and the durability? Why \\\\ndo some brands, like--you know, I probably shouldn&#x27;t say this--\\\\nSpeed Queen still pretty good. Right? But a lot of these things \\\\nhave just gone through the floor.\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    And I personally have very similar home appliances, our \\\\nfront-loading washing machine, we have had to replace our \\\\nrefrigerator where we had refrigerators that lasted, you know, \\\\n20 years. I think trying to regulate that, I think that is \\\\nreally a market control issue, because one of the things on our \\\\nrefrigeration side particularly--and, again, we always talk \\\\nabout on that side of it--is that in commercial refrigeration, \\\\nthose are the harshest. I mean, your kitchen is harsh, but your \\\\ncommercial kitchen is many times even more harsh. And, \\\\ncompetitively, that is what we promote in our products. That \\\\nhas always been our kind of baseline is making sure we have \\\\nsafe temperatures. We use heavier gauged materials and such \\\\nthan others. And I have to say that, unfortunately, with \\\\nmeeting, again, very aggressive energy standards like the \\\\nDepartment of Energy is actually proposing actually hurts that \\\\nbecause we have to take out materials in other areas to try \\\\nto----\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. But, like, any technician can look \\\\nat something and say what is trash and what is going to last, \\\\nyou know. Like, you can--you know, mechanical engineers I don&#x27;t \\\\nthink have that brain necessarily, but----\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. I&#x27;m both.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. But do you see any way that you can \\\\nimplement or is this going to be more regulation?\\\\n    Mr. BAUMAN. Because of the complexity, again, as you get \\\\ninto electronic controls, fan speeds, a number of the things I \\\\nmentioned as far as, again, talking about commercial \\\\nrefrigeration and also on the air-conditioning side with the \\\\nnew refrigerants that are required, they all required a lot \\\\nmore electronics, a lot more things that all--additional \\\\ncomponents that break down and reduce the overall life of the \\\\nproduct as it is used, again, in very harsh conditions.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Okay. Well, thank you sincerely to \\\\nall of our witnesses for being here today.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I would like to--we are right on time. I would like to \\\\nthank our witnesses for their testimony today and for appearing \\\\nhere.\\\\n    Without objection, the Members have 5 legislative days to \\\\nsubmit additional materials and written requests, questions for \\\\nthe witnesses to the Chair which will be forwarded to the \\\\nwitnesses.

ALEJANDRO N. MAYORKAS, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND \\\\n    SECURITY\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. The Subcommittee on Homeland Security will come \\\\nto order.\\\\n    I am pleased to be joined today by the subcommittee&#x27;s \\\\ndistinguished ranking member, my good friend, the gentleman \\\\nfrom Texas, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Welcome Secretary Mayorkas. I sincerely thank \\\\nyou for being here to discuss your Department&#x27;s 2025 fiscal \\\\nyear budget request.\\\\n    While it is very clear that we have profound differences of \\\\nopinion on how the Department should be running, on what \\\\npolicies should be in place, especially as it relates to border \\\\nsecurity and immigration enforcement, I would ask members on \\\\nboth sides today to keep discussion civil and focused on the \\\\nwork we need to do as appropriators to fund the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security.\\\\n    Additionally, on behalf of the entire committee, I&#x27;d like \\\\nto convey my sincere appreciation for the tireless and often \\\\nthankless work done by the men and women of DHS on a daily \\\\nbasis.\\\\n    Turning our attention to fiscal year 2025 budget requests, \\\\nthis proposal, nearly identical to last year&#x27;s request, is \\\\nunfortunately more disappointing than it is promising.\\\\n    This budget is not only full of gimmicks that mask the true \\\\ncost of protecting the homeland, but it also fails to address \\\\nthe policy driven crisis that continues at the border.\\\\n    For over 3 years, we have seen skyrocketing illegal \\\\nimmigration at our borders and every corner of the country can \\\\nsee and feel its impact. The American people know that the \\\\nborder is not secure. It is a full-blown crisis that this \\\\nadministration has sought to downplay for years.\\\\n    While recently the messaging has changed as the 2024 \\\\nelection nears, the budget shows these are just empty words. \\\\nThis request is not serious if the goal is to actually fix the \\\\nproblem and secure our border.\\\\n    Does the request ask for enough resources to remove more \\\\nthan 1.3 million aliens on the non-detained docket whose cases \\\\nhave already been adjudicated and no longer have a legal basis \\\\nto remain in this country?\\\\n    Or does it ask for an appropriate level of detention beds \\\\nto detain aliens who pose a national security risk or public \\\\nsafety risk? No. This administration instead asks for 7,500 \\\\nless beds than the Congress just funded in FY 2024 budget.\\\\n    Does this request ask for policy changes that would help \\\\nour agents officers deter the mass migration we have seen under \\\\nthis administration? No, it does not. Does the request ask for \\\\nadditional funding for barriers? Again, the answer is no.\\\\n    Instead of building the wall, this administration has \\\\nwasted every dime it legally could spend on environmental \\\\nremediation efforts to clean up the mess it made when it \\\\nstopped the contracts that were in place building the wall.\\\\n    What does the administration ask for? A $4.7 billion \\\\nsouthwest border contingency fund that exceeds the caps \\\\nestablished by the Financial Responsibility Act. This slush \\\\nfund, proposed last year, was rejected on a bipartisan basis \\\\nbecause Republicans and Democrats alike recognized that giving \\\\nthis department billions of dollars with very little \\\\ncongressional oversight and no incentive to change course, \\\\nwould likely exacerbate the existing situation.\\\\n    Again, this administration&#x27;s approach to the border is just \\\\nto manage the chaos, a position that most fair-minded Americans \\\\nreject. Decreasing detention capacity has not worked. Abusing \\\\nthe parole system has not worked. Catch and release has not \\\\nworked. Executive orders that impede immigration enforcement \\\\nhave not worked.\\\\n    Border security operators have been clear. Without quick \\\\nand decisive consequences, the illegal flow will continue \\\\nunabashed. The daily number of migrant encounters are still \\\\nabove 5,000 a day. Despite every single policy this \\\\nadministration has tried.\\\\n    The President has implemented many of the policies that \\\\nhave contributed to this crisis with a stroke of a pen and he \\\\ncould reverse them if he chooses. It is our job, as \\\\nappropriators, to be good stewards of the taxpayer dollars and \\\\nensure that we are not wasting money doing more of the same and \\\\nexpecting a different result.\\\\n    I look forward to working with you and the Department to \\\\nseek actual solutions to address the border security crisis at \\\\nhand and to combat the many threats that face our homeland.\\\\n    I now turn to my colleague, Mr. Cuellar for his opening \\\\nremarks.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much. And I want to \\\\nthank you and the members on both sides of the aisles and the \\\\nstaff for putting together a very good appropriation bill for \\\\nFY 2024. I think we&#x27;ll do the same for FY 2025. But I certainly \\\\nwant to say thank you to the Secretary.\\\\n    I want to say thank you to the work that you do, your men \\\\nand women that do the work every single day. I was, as you \\\\nknow, I always say I don&#x27;t go visit the border, I live at the \\\\nborder. But I did go on the riverboat just last week, less than \\\\na week ago with border patrol.\\\\n    We talked about the importance of getting rid of Carrizo \\\\nCane so they can see river roads which are so important to us, \\\\ntechnology that are so important to us.\\\\n    So I just want to say thank you for the work that you and \\\\nyour men and women do across the country. I do want to say, \\\\nlooking at the numbers for the last 21 days, in between ports, \\\\nthere are about 3,800 a day. 3,800 a day.\\\\n    You add the CBP, maybe add a little bit over 1,000. So \\\\nyou&#x27;re talking about 5,000 a day. But 3,800 a day coming in \\\\nvery different. So we&#x27;re doing something right.\\\\n    And I ask you to continue to look at what we need to do to \\\\nbring those numbers down. 3,800 in between ports a day for the \\\\nlast 3 weeks. So let&#x27;s continue doing that. I do agree with the \\\\nChairman. We did fund 41,500 beds. Don&#x27;t want to speak for \\\\nanybody else, but I do support 41,500 beds.\\\\n    I do support the Charter Air for ICE, and I certainly want \\\\nto ask you about that. And somewhere down the line, I certainly \\\\nwant to ask you about what the President&#x27;s looking at.\\\\n    I&#x27;ve always felt that the President can do an executive \\\\norder. My understanding is that there is talk about another \\\\nexecutive order, because if you get 100 people that ask for \\\\nasylum, at the end of the day, they go to a judge 4, 5, 6 years \\\\nlater, 87 percent to 90 percent are going to be rejected.\\\\n    So we got to do something at the very beginning. If they \\\\ndon&#x27;t qualify for those five reasons, persecution by the state \\\\non those five reasons, I think we need to look at that.\\\\n    If we do, if the president does that, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;ll be \\\\na court case by some folks that don&#x27;t agree with him, but we \\\\ncertainly have to look at that. So I certainly want to say \\\\nthank you.\\\\n    I hope that on the 22,000 Border Patrol agents that we had, \\\\nI hope that you all look at the polygraph. That&#x27;s been a big \\\\nproblem. I talked to the Border Patrol, whoever that vendor is, \\\\nand hopefully they&#x27;re listening to me. We got to do something \\\\nabout that.\\\\n    And certainly because we don&#x27;t hire people, I know at one \\\\ntime, even under the Trump administration, we were losing more \\\\npeople to attrition than we were hiring Border Patrol.\\\\n    So we got to do a better job on that. I certainly want to \\\\nsay the technology that we are looking at is very, very \\\\nimportant. I do want to say there is a court order. And let me \\\\nsee if we can put a little bit of more legislative intent here, \\\\nwhere a recent injunction by a federal judge in my home state, \\\\nwho I think is wrongly interpreting the congressional intent of \\\\nfunding, provided border barrier systems for fiscal years 2020 \\\\nand 2021.\\\\n    If you look at the language, Congress purposely chose the \\\\nbroader system, the word system language, to intend that it was \\\\nto fund a system and not just a vertical wall.\\\\n    So that means, because of this injunction, we can do river \\\\nroads that are so key to border patrol, lighting, border \\\\ntechnology, they&#x27;re all on hold. And if this funding is lapsed, \\\\nthen we got to come back and re-appropriate that while we have \\\\nfunding right now.\\\\n    So I hope you all appeal that injunction. And again, I have \\\\nquestions, but I just want to say to all your men and women \\\\nthat are under Homeland Security, I just want to say thank you \\\\nfor the job. 3,800 a day in between ports, then you had what \\\\ncomes to CBP, close to 5,000. But in between ports is what \\\\nwe&#x27;re focusing on.\\\\n    Continue doing and let us know what we need to do to make \\\\nsure we do that and certainly to close up. Mexico has been a \\\\npartner and whatever you need to do to make sure they continue \\\\ndoing what they are doing. Less numbers of people come to the \\\\nnorthern border than the numbers go down working with the \\\\nenforcement levels that you&#x27;re doing.\\\\n    So I certainly encourage you to continue working with \\\\nMexico on that. With that Mr. Chairman and members, thank you \\\\nso much. And Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here with us \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas, without objection, your full written \\\\ntestimony will be entered into the record.\\\\n    With that in mind, we would ask for you to please summarize \\\\nyour opening statement for us in 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n                 Opening Statement: Secretary Mayorkas\\\\n\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Chairman Joyce, Ranking Member Cuellar, \\\\ndistinguished members of this Committee.\\\\n    Every day, the 268,000 men and women of the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security (DHS) carry out our mission to protect the \\\\nsafety and security of the American people.\\\\n    They protect our shores, harbors, skies, cyberspace, \\\\nborders, and leaders. They stop fentanyl and other deadly drugs \\\\nfrom entering our country. They lead the response to maritime \\\\nemergencies.\\\\n    As we speak, they are engaged in the response to the tragic \\\\nFrancis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore.\\\\n    They help communities recover and rebuild after a natural \\\\ndisaster. They combat the scourges of human trafficking, forced \\\\nlabor, and online child sexual exploitation, and so much more.\\\\n    All this despite a perennially insufficient budget. The \\\\ndedicated public servants of DHS deserve full support, and the \\\\nAmerican people deserve the results a fully resourced DHS can \\\\ndeliver.\\\\n    The funding opportunities outlined in the President&#x27;s \\\\nfiscal year (FY) 2025 budget for DHS are critical to meeting \\\\nboth goals.\\\\n    I welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposed budget \\\\nand highlight some of its key proposals with you today.\\\\n    When the Department was founded in the wake of 9/11, the \\\\nthreat of foreign terrorism against high visibility targets was \\\\nour primary concern. That foreign threat persists and the U.S. \\\\ncontinues to be in a heightened threat environment.\\\\n    We now also confront the terrorism related threat of \\\\nradicalized lone offenders and small groups already resident \\\\nhere in the United States. This budget provides for an $80 \\\\nmillion increase to our Department&#x27;s Nonprofit Security Grant \\\\nProgram (NSGP) and additional funds for targeted violence and \\\\nterrorism prevention grants so that DHS can better help \\\\ncommunities prevent tragedies from occurring.\\\\n    As lone actors and nation states increasingly target our \\\\ncritical infrastructure and our data, the President&#x27;s Budget \\\\nprovides the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency \\\\n(CISA) with needed funding to improve our cybersecurity and \\\\nresiliency.\\\\n    Fentanyl is wreaking tragedy in communities across the \\\\ncountry. DHS has interdicted more illicit fentanyl and arrested \\\\nmore individuals for fentanyl-related crimes in the last two \\\\nfiscal years than in the previous five combined. We must do \\\\nmore.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s Budget includes critical funding to advance \\\\nour strategy, including funds for non-intrusive inspection, \\\\ntechnology, and targeted operations.\\\\n    During a time when the world, including our hemisphere, is \\\\nexperiencing the greatest displacement of people since World \\\\nWar II, DHS has toughened our border enforcement and is \\\\nmaximizing our available resources and authorities.\\\\n    In the last 11 months, we have removed or returned more \\\\nthan 630,000 individuals who did not have a legal basis to \\\\nstay, more than in every full fiscal year since 2013.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s budget would further expand these efforts. \\\\nIt provides $25.9 billion for U.S. Customs and Border \\\\nProtection (CBP) and U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement \\\\n(ICE), including funds for hiring more enforcement personnel. A \\\\nseparate $265 million would be used by U.S. Citizenship and \\\\nImmigration Services (USCIS) to bolster refugee processing as \\\\nwe continue to expand lawful pathways and ensure that \\\\nprotection remains accessible for those who qualify under our \\\\nlaws.\\\\n    Our immigration system, however, is fundamentally broken, \\\\nincluding our asylum system that so significantly impacts the \\\\nsecurity of our borders and the processes we administer at it.\\\\n    Only Congress can fix our broken and outdated system, and \\\\nonly Congress can address our need for more U.S. Border Patrol \\\\nagents, asylum officers, and immigration judges, facilities, \\\\nand technology.\\\\n    Our administration worked closely with a bipartisan group \\\\nof senators to reach agreement on a national security \\\\nsupplemental package, one that would make the system changes \\\\nthat are needed and give DHS the tools and resources needed to \\\\nmeet today&#x27;s border security challenges. We remain ready to \\\\nwork with you to pass this tough, fair, bipartisan agreement.\\\\n    Finally, extreme weather continues to devastate \\\\ncommunities. Last year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency \\\\n(FEMA) responded to more than 100 disasters. Our budget \\\\nprovides $22.7 billion to assist community leaders and help \\\\nsurvivors in the aftermath of major disasters and additional \\\\nfunds to invest in resilience strategies that will save lives \\\\nand taxpayer money in the decades to come.\\\\n    Essential to our success across all mission sets is the \\\\nDepartment&#x27;s ability to recruit and retain a world-class \\\\nworkforce.\\\\n    In addition to the frontline border workforce I mentioned, \\\\nthe President&#x27;s Budget includes $1.5 billion to maintain our \\\\ncommitment to fairly compensate the Transportation Security \\\\nAgency (TSA) workforce, continuing the long overdue FY 2023 \\\\ninitiative we worked together to implement.\\\\n    I look forward to working and further discussing with you \\\\nthese critical missions and the Department&#x27;s needs for both the \\\\ncoming and current fiscal years.\\\\n    The recently passed 2024 budget, though welcome and helpful \\\\nto many of our operations, was enacted too late to implement an \\\\nappreciable hiring surge. It reduced by 20 percent much needed \\\\nsupport for cities dealing with migrant related challenges. And \\\\nit cut critical research and development funding, the \\\\ncompounding effects of which the Department will feel for \\\\nyears.\\\\n    I am eager to work with you to address these and other \\\\nshortfalls in the weeks ahead, as I am eager to deliver \\\\ntogether the sustained funding, resources, and support that the \\\\nextraordinarily talented and dedicated public servants of DHS \\\\nneed and deserve. Thank you.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n                           ILLEGAL MIGRATION\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for questions.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas, as I&#x27;ve already mentioned, the non-\\\\ndetained docket has grown at an unprecedented and unsustainable \\\\nrate because this administration refuses to use its executive \\\\nauthority to deter illegal migration and mitigate this chaos, \\\\nwe know that the non-detained docket caseload will only \\\\ncontinue to rise.\\\\n    Again, for reference, only 1.3 million of the more 7 \\\\nmillion cases on the non-detained docket have been adjudicated \\\\nand ordered removed. What&#x27;s your plan to remove the more than \\\\n1.3 million migrants who no longer have a legal basis to remain \\\\nin this country? And how long will it take you to effectuate \\\\nevery single removal order?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Mr. Chairman, this administration, in \\\\nthe last 11 months, has removed or returned more than 630,000 \\\\npeople, more than in any fiscal year since 2013.\\\\n    We take our enforcement responsibilities very seriously, \\\\nand we have only increased enforcement efforts over past years.\\\\n    I will respectfully submit to you, Mr. Chairman, as I \\\\narticulated in my opening statement, that the bipartisan bill \\\\nthat a group of senators worked on, I had the privilege of \\\\nbeing seated with them, would have delivered a consequence \\\\nregime like no other.\\\\n    It would have been the first time, since 1996, that our \\\\nbroken system would have delivered the much-needed fixes that \\\\nwe need to fully enforce the law and to deliver a consequence \\\\nregime that will indeed deter illegal migration.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. That&#x27;s a great answer, but what are you going to \\\\ndo about the people who are still here? Do you have a plan in \\\\nplace to remove those people on an orderly basis?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. We certainly do. And we continue to \\\\nexecute that plan. It is through that effort that we were able \\\\nto remove or return 630,000 people over the past 11 months.\\\\n    We will continue to accelerate those efforts with the \\\\nresources we have. Our proposed budget seeks additional \\\\nresources, not as many as the bipartisan legislation would have \\\\nprovided to us.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. But you don&#x27;t have that legislation, sir. So how \\\\ncan you justify using ICE detention space for border \\\\ndecompression efforts when the Department has such a large \\\\nvolume of interior enforcement needs?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Mr. Chairman, we use our detention \\\\ncapabilities to ensure that our enforcement priorities are \\\\nrealized. And our greatest enforcement priorities are to ensure \\\\nthat individuals who pose a public safety or national security \\\\nrisk to the American people are detained. That is our highest \\\\ndetention priority.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Well, I can tell you that the two people who \\\\nwere recently murdered in Ohio by aliens, their families aren&#x27;t \\\\ngoing to accept that as an answer.\\\\n    I recognize Mr. Cuellar for any questions he may have.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary. Let&#x27;s talk about the migrants who are \\\\nreleased into the country after they have been processed and \\\\nvetted by Border Patrol.\\\\n    One of the tools, legal tools, that you have at your \\\\ndisposal is the use of expedited removal. And I do agree with \\\\nyou, if Congress would do its job and pass the Senate bill, \\\\nthat I think is the first time since 1996 that we actually make \\\\nsome changes, especially looking at the asylum criteria.\\\\n    And again, as I&#x27;ve said, five reasons, political, religion, \\\\net cetera, et cetera, persecution by the state. You know, I was \\\\njust at a holding institute in Laredo and we&#x27;re talking, \\\\ntalking to the folks there, and they said that most of them are \\\\ncoming in for economic reasons, even though they say asylum, \\\\nbut it&#x27;s economic reasons.\\\\n    So one of the tools that we could provide to you if we pass \\\\nthe Senate deal, I mean, that I agree with you, but one of the \\\\nother ones that you have is expedited removal, which is a \\\\nprocess that is intended to identify those individuals and \\\\nfamilies who are truly seeking asylum and to quickly remove the \\\\nrest.\\\\n    However, as you know, your men and women are unable to do \\\\nthat because we lack some of the resources, and that doesn&#x27;t \\\\ngive you the options that I wish we had.\\\\n    So what I would ask you, if there&#x27;s not enough space \\\\nbetween CBP and ICE to hold folks through the full duration of \\\\nthe removal proceedings, if you had more asylum officers and \\\\nprocessing capacity, would you put more migrants into expedited \\\\nremoval proceedings and would that help you manage challenges \\\\nat the border?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Thank you, Member Cuellar.\\\\n    We issued a regulation, the Asylum Officer Regulation, that \\\\ngave greater power to our asylum officers, which enabled us to \\\\nmove more quickly through the asylum adjudication process.\\\\n    One major provision of the Senate bipartisan legislation, \\\\nthat would have been so incredibly impactful, was to allow us \\\\nto apply expedited removal proceedings, a much more accelerated \\\\nremoval process, to individuals outside of immigration \\\\ndetention.\\\\n    Right now, for single adults, we are restricted to applying \\\\nexpedited removal to those in detention. That bipartisan \\\\nlegislation would have provided us with extraordinary \\\\nenforcement tools, and I remain uncertain why it was not \\\\nunanimously approved.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. I agree with you.\\\\n    So just to make sure. So you cannot use expedited removal \\\\nunder title VIII unless if they&#x27;re detained?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. That is my understanding of the law. To \\\\nthe best of my recollection, Mr. Ranking Member.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Yes, sir. And we just don&#x27;t have that \\\\nprocessing space to keep all those folks; is that correct?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Well, as Ranking Member Cuellar noted, \\\\nthe number of encounters has dropped significantly over the \\\\npast several months. The number of encounters does not, in any \\\\nway, equal the number of detention beds that we have.\\\\n    The 2024 budget, I think, funded 41,500 detention beds, and \\\\nwe are encountering approximately 3,800 people in between the \\\\nports of entry (POE) over the past several weeks, as Mr. \\\\nChairman noted.\\\\n    So, detention is not the only consequence delivery that we \\\\ncan issue. What is needed is the swift and fast removal of \\\\nindividuals who do not qualify for relief.\\\\n    The bipartisan legislation would have taken a seven-year \\\\nasylum process, a seven plus year asylum process, and reduced \\\\nit to as little as 90 days. That would have been a game \\\\nchanger.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. So what, besides the Senate language, which I \\\\nsupport, besides that, what resources would you need to \\\\nincrease your expedited removal operations to meet the demands \\\\nthat we anticipate?\\\\n    And keep in mind that in between ports, it&#x27;s 3,800, at \\\\nleast for the last 3 weeks, 21-days average. What resources \\\\nwould you need and how would you use that?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Ranking Member Cuellar, it is at every \\\\nstage of the removal process and everything in between that we \\\\nwould need resources.\\\\n    More U.S. Border Patrol agents and more support personnel, \\\\nso we can ensure that those U.S. Border Patrol agents are out \\\\nin the field doing the enforcement work that they signed up and \\\\nfor which they are so skilled to perform.\\\\n    More asylum officers, more ICE personnel, more detention \\\\ncapacity, more funds for alternatives to detention, more \\\\ntransportation resources, including more resources to be able \\\\nto execute more removal flights, and more legislative \\\\nauthorities so that we can actually fund other countries in \\\\nenforcing their borders and removing people from their \\\\ncountries before they ever reach the southern border of the \\\\nUnited States.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And my time&#x27;s up. But I do want to emphasize \\\\nwhat you said. Expedite removal is only if you have somebody in \\\\ndetention. And if they are out, then we need some changes of \\\\nthe law, like the Senate deal does. Thank you so much.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. You are welcome, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    We now recognize Sheriff Rutherford.\\\\n\\\\n                           ILLEGAL MIGRATION\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. I want to go back \\\\nto a statement that you made in response to the Chairman&#x27;s \\\\nquestion about how many people we have deported.\\\\n    You said 630,000 have been returned. That is not accurate. \\\\nThe actual ICE deportations is 142,580. All those other people \\\\nthat you&#x27;re talking about were rejected at the border.\\\\n    These are not ICE deportations. And you conflate those two \\\\nnumbers, and it&#x27;s aggravating to me that you do that. And here \\\\nwe are, we&#x27;ve got the same problem that we had a year ago when \\\\nyou were here.\\\\n    In fact, since you last testified before us, 2.4 million \\\\npeople have crossed our southern border. That&#x27;s more than 4 \\\\nyears of President Trump&#x27;s presidency combined.\\\\n    Your immigration policy is in chaos. You don&#x27;t need \\\\nCongress to do anything. The President&#x27;s got the ability to do \\\\nit. You just need to talk to him to get it done.\\\\n    Now, in fiscal year 2023, there were 294 illegal aliens on \\\\nthe terrorist watch list that were arrested between ports of \\\\nentry. And those are just the ones we caught.\\\\n    How many more are there in the 1.7 million gotaways that we \\\\nhave had over the last three years? Last year, as I mentioned \\\\nearlier, we deported 142,580 people, but more than that have \\\\ncrossed the border every month for the last 36 months.\\\\n    We have 6.1 million, listen to this number, people, 6.1 \\\\nmillion people in the interior of this country on the non-\\\\ndetained docket, almost double what it was in 2020. Of those \\\\nroughly 13 percent, 1.2 million of them have orders for \\\\nremoval.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, why haven&#x27;t you removed those 1.2 million? I \\\\nmean, you said you deported 630,000. No, you didn&#x27;t. They have \\\\nexhausted their due process. They have been told they have to \\\\nget out. They have got orders to leave this country, and you \\\\nlet them stay.\\\\n    Migrants in cities across America are waiting to get an \\\\nappointment in an ICE office. These are the ones that are on \\\\nthe non-detained list. They&#x27;re waiting years.\\\\n    And despite all the evidence of this crisis, that every \\\\nsingle term this administration is undermined our safety and \\\\nour security.\\\\n    You halted the wall construction. You ended migration \\\\nprotection protocols. You have created this mass parole \\\\nprogram, and you are making an adequate request for detention \\\\nspace.\\\\n    This administration&#x27;s failure is making our communities \\\\nless safe. We have people crossing the border without \\\\nidentification. We don&#x27;t know who they are. I have talked to \\\\nyou about this before, about the improper vetting that is going \\\\non, and your default policy seems to be to just let them in.\\\\n    We can&#x27;t figure out who they are. We don&#x27;t know who they \\\\nare for sure because they are not in any database. Come on in.\\\\n    Just a couple years ago in my hometown in Jacksonville, we \\\\nhad a 28-year-old illegal immigrant, I&#x27;m sorry, he was 23, \\\\nmurdered one of my constituents.\\\\n    CBP encountered him and couldn&#x27;t confirm who he was or how \\\\nold he was because he had no identification investigation, but \\\\nhe said he was a juvenile, used a fake name.\\\\n    So under your catch and release policy, that you re-\\\\ninstituted after President Trump had ended that, handed him off \\\\nto HHS. And then it wasn&#x27;t until after he killed Mr. Cuellar, \\\\nnot this Mr. Cuellar, but Cuellar in Jacksonville, that we find \\\\nout who he is.\\\\n    It&#x27;s Mr. Ulloa, and he&#x27;s now serving 60 years in Florida \\\\nstate prison. Just last month, we saw another one, horrible \\\\nmurder because we failed to properly vet an individual and Lake \\\\nand Riley was murdered by him.\\\\n    Look, I want states to work with--I want state and local \\\\nlaw enforcement to work with ICE. We did in my jurisdiction \\\\nwhen I was sheriff in Jacksonville, we had a great 287(g) \\\\nprogram, and that&#x27;s a fantastic program.\\\\n\\\\n        U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: 287(G) PROGRAM\\\\n\\\\n    And in fact, I am not the only one that thinks that. Last \\\\nyear, acting director of ICE, Tae Johnson, told this Committee \\\\nthat the 287(g) Program, and I will quote, ``is the best thing \\\\nsince sliced bread, because it acts as a force multiplier.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    So my question for you very quickly is, do you agree with \\\\nthe director&#x27;s assessment of the 287(g) Program, and if so, \\\\nwhat are you doing to expand it?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, the public safety and \\\\nsecurity of this country is our highest priority.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Doesn&#x27;t appear so.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, if you&#x27;ll allow me. I \\\\nbelieve that when an individual poses a threat to public safety \\\\nor national security, a local or state jurisdiction should \\\\ncooperate with ICE for the swift detention and removal of that \\\\nindividual.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. So you didn&#x27;t answer my question. Do you \\\\nthink 287(g) Program is a good program, and should--will you \\\\nwork with us to expand it?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I continue to believe that \\\\n287(g), when executed properly, is a force multiplier for our \\\\nenforcement efforts.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Is that a, yes?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. As I said, when it is executed \\\\nproperly, it is a force multiplier for our enforcement efforts.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. You can&#x27;t get a straight answer out of this \\\\nguy.\\\\n    Look, I see my time is up. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, sheriff.\\\\n    Miss Underwood.\\\\n\\\\n                      SHELTER AND SERVICES PROGRAM\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, it&#x27;s good to see you again, especially \\\\nduring a busy week.\\\\n    My district stretches across seven counties in northern \\\\nIllinois outside of Chicago. And as you know, for over a year \\\\nnow, anti-immigrant extremists in southern states have \\\\ncoordinated the deceptive and inhumane busing of migrants \\\\narriving at our southern border to blue states like New York or \\\\nIllinois, including my community. They are using vulnerable \\\\npeople the vast majority of whom are legally seeking asylum as \\\\npawns in their shameless and shameful political stunt. In \\\\ncontrast, I am so proud to be from Illinois where under the \\\\nleadership of our governor, Governor Pritzker, and Mayor \\\\nJohnson in Chicago our community has come together to provide \\\\nresources and support to these new arrivals in alignment with \\\\nour values as Americans.\\\\n    I certainly recognize and appreciate how you and your team \\\\nhave made this issue a priority. But at this point, to speak \\\\nplainly, Illinois desperately needs more federal support than \\\\nwe are getting. So today I want to talk about our options for \\\\nthe coming months and the current political reality. That means \\\\nwithout the Senate supplemental so just with current DHS \\\\nauthorities and the fiscal year 2024 funding package.\\\\n    Much of the federal funding for communities supporting \\\\nmigrants comes through FEMA&#x27;s Shelter and Services Protection \\\\nProgram, or SSP, and this funding is largely directed to \\\\nSouthern border states, but as these states like Texas continue \\\\nto bus thousands of new arrivals north it is time to take a \\\\nlook at how we allocate that money. Almost 900 buses with \\\\nmigrants have been sent to Chicagoland in the last 18 months, \\\\nbut just last year in round one of SSP funding the state of \\\\nTexas received 11 of the 34 grants awarded. Illinois received \\\\ntwo. In round 2, Texas received 33 of the 54 grants awarded, \\\\nand Illinois received two. For grants awarded with reserve \\\\nfunding, Texas received 28 of the 35 grants awarded. Illinois \\\\nreceived none.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, what specific steps is DHS taking to ensure \\\\nthat more fiscal year 2024 funds are directed to communities \\\\nactually welcoming migrants? Can you commit that Illinois will \\\\nsee a greater share of SSP resources this year?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, regrettably the 2024 \\\\nbudget includes a reduction in the amount of Shelter and \\\\nServices Program funding. We are put in a difficult position of \\\\nallocating insufficient resources between cities in the \\\\ninterior of the United States that actually receive the \\\\nindividuals who are in immigration enforcement proceedings and \\\\nthe border communities that initially encounter them. We are \\\\nworking through that allocation right now to distribute the \\\\n2024 funds at least in the first tranche, and allow me to \\\\nassure you, Congresswoman, that we are working very closely \\\\nwith the jurisdictions both in the interior and at the border \\\\nto increase and maximize the effectiveness of the allocations.\\\\n\\\\n                       EMERGENCY FUNDING CHICAGO\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Yes, sir. Southern border states will likely \\\\nalways need some dedicated support, but it seems contradictory \\\\nfor a State receiving such a large portion of the funding \\\\ndedicated to sheltering and providing services for migrants and \\\\nthen to bus those migrants to other states as soon as they \\\\narrive. Furthermore, the total SSP funding in the bipartisan \\\\n2024 funding package fell short, as you mentioned, so we need \\\\nto get creative about more solutions. So what other tools are \\\\nyou thinking about utilizing in order to increase the support \\\\nthat DHS can provide to Illinois communities experiencing \\\\nmigrant bussing this year, and then can USCIS surge personnel \\\\nto improve processing times for work authorizations, for \\\\nexample, or take any other steps to address those types of \\\\ndelays, and can DHS access any emergency funding or work with \\\\nother agencies like HHS or DoD to unlock resources?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, a few points. First and \\\\nmost fundamentally it is our hope that public officials will \\\\nactually coordinate, communicate and collaborate with other \\\\npublic officials to ensure that the interests of the Nation are \\\\nproperly served and that chaos is not deliberately sowed, \\\\nnumber one.\\\\n    Number 2, we have deployed teams to some of the interior \\\\ncities to ensure that our expertise in the processing of \\\\nindividuals and understanding their eligibility for certain \\\\nbenefits is fully realized, and we have dispatched a team to \\\\nChicago, IL for that purpose. So we are working very closely \\\\nacross the administration and with the cities to address the \\\\nchallenges before us.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. And with those teams do they include again \\\\npersonnel across the interagency including USCIS to be able to \\\\nincrease processing, to access funds from other departments, et \\\\ncetera? If not, please consider taking those steps as we move \\\\nforward particularly in this moment where we have to use more \\\\ncreative strategies because, as you know, sir, hope is not a \\\\nsolution, and it is certainly not a policy, and we know that \\\\nsome of these extremists in the southern states are not going \\\\nto change their behavior particularly as we approach the fall. \\\\nMr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you. I now recognize Ms. Hinson.\\\\n\\\\n                       BORDER SECURITY: GOT-AWAYS\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Ranking \\\\nMember Cuellar for holding this hearing today. Mr. Secretary, \\\\nthank you for appearing before us. You state in your testimony \\\\nthat the president&#x27;s budget request prioritizing staying ahead \\\\nof diverse and complex threats facing the homeland and \\\\nhighlights your unwavering dedication protecting the security \\\\nof the American people.\\\\n    And the president&#x27;s budget also states that strengthening \\\\nborder security and providing safe and lawful pathways for \\\\nmigration remain top priorities for the administration. I want \\\\nto build on something one of my colleagues asked, Mr. \\\\nSecretary. How many got-aways have there been since President \\\\nBiden took office?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, I will provide that data \\\\nto you. I don&#x27;t have the number----\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. He said 1.7 million got away. So you and the \\\\nBiden administration over the past few years have reversed the \\\\nsecure policies that were working. You stopped the border wall \\\\nconstruction, expanded parole, allowed for millions of \\\\nindividuals, as we have heard, including known and suspected \\\\nterrorists, cartel members, unforgivable levels of Fentanyl and \\\\nillicit drugs and substances into our country. These 1.7 \\\\nmillion individuals came into our country in neither a safe nor \\\\nlawful way. Yet again you sit before this committee and ask for \\\\nout of touch priorities again and refuse to take accountability \\\\nfor the total failure that you have allowed for the Southern \\\\nborder.\\\\n\\\\n        U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: DETENTION BEDS\\\\n\\\\n    So again I want to build on something one of my colleagues \\\\nsaid. Why would you raise--when we raised the detention bed \\\\ncapacity for ICE to 41,500 would you request bringing that \\\\nnumber down to 34,000?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, my answer is twofold. \\\\nNumber 1, of course the 2024 budget and the 41,500 beds \\\\nallocated to us postdated our submission of the FY 2025 budget \\\\nwhere we remained at 34,000 beds. We will, of course, work with \\\\nthis committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee to \\\\nensure that the 41,500 bed capacity is sustained in the year \\\\nahead, and----\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. This is about deterrence. This is about border \\\\ndeterrence, and what we want to see happen is a proper \\\\naccountability and oversight of that deterrence. $4.7 billion \\\\nyou got for the Southwest Border Contingency Fund which we know \\\\nis a slush fund that you have access to because you came before \\\\nthe committee last year asking for that same out of touch \\\\npriority.\\\\n    So I think you have really disrespected hardworking \\\\ntaxpayers again through these processes attempting to get this \\\\nslush fund in place to circumvent congressional direction. I \\\\nthink that is appalling. That is what I hear from Iowans. The \\\\npurpose of the slush fund is stated to be around the \\\\nuncertainty surrounding border conditions in any given year for \\\\nsurge related functions, but you have systematically wasted \\\\ntaxpayer dollars already. You have opened the door for these \\\\nsurge related activities waving the green light for all these \\\\nmigrants to come, cartels, the human drug traffickers.\\\\n    There is no excuse to call for billions of dollars of \\\\nadditional slush fund dollars when it is clear that your \\\\nleadership and decision-making is so off the mark here. And I \\\\nthink it is very concerning and alarming for a secretary that \\\\ninstilled to protect our homeland to compromise on this.\\\\n    In your testimony, you did state, I am eager to work with \\\\nCongress to deliver for the American people and the men and \\\\nwomen who protect our homeland, but you are pointing the finger \\\\nat Congress to fix the very decisions that the administration \\\\nhas made that have led to this crisis. Correct?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. No. That is incorrect.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Why do you think that is incorrect.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Actually pointing to Congress to fix \\\\nwhat everyone agrees is a broken immigration system. \\\\nCongresswoman, you mentioned the 41,500 detention beds that are \\\\nfunded in FY 2024. That is less than the bipartisan Senate bill \\\\nwould have provided. The bipartisan Senate bill would have \\\\nprovided 50,000 detention beds.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. The Senate bill also allows the President way \\\\ntoo much authority in terms of circumventing all of the legal \\\\nprocesses that we do have in place, and we have seen emergency \\\\nrequests for, obviously, the crisis that you and the Biden \\\\nadministration have created purposefully and systematically. I \\\\ndon&#x27;t think that is a good argument. You have reversed again \\\\ncountless policies that were in place that were working to keep \\\\nour Southwest border under control, opening floodwalls for this \\\\nsecurity crisis at our Southern border again unprecedented \\\\nlevels of illicit drugs and deadly Fentanyl.\\\\n    You speak of a consequence regime, Mr. Secretary. My \\\\nconstituents are feeling the consequence of this regime every \\\\nsingle day, pounds of drugs instead of ounces in my district, \\\\nincreased crime. We are seeing a complete overwhelming number \\\\nof illegal immigrant children in our district overwhelming Iowa \\\\nclassrooms and teachers every single day. You can try to hide \\\\nfrom the American public at how we got to this point. You can \\\\npoint fingers at Congress for fixing systems, but Mr. Secretary \\\\nwe&#x27;ve seen gamesmanship out of the administration and gimmicks. \\\\nI called for your resignation last year, and I stand by my \\\\nrequest, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you. We now recognize Congressman Case.\\\\n\\\\n                   NATIONAL DISASTER: MAUI WILDFIRES\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Case. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, it has \\\\nbeen a little over 8 months since the incredibly tragic Maui \\\\nwildfires, some of the worst in our country&#x27;s history, and I \\\\nwant to start by thanking the Department of Homeland Security, \\\\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, you personally \\\\nas well as Administrator Criswell, Mr. Fenton and your entire \\\\nteam for the response on Maui which has been a tremendous \\\\nresponse. We have certainly felt that you have been full \\\\npartners in this recovery.\\\\n    I have Mayor Bissen actually from Maui in the room here, \\\\nand he wanted me to express his personal appreciation to you as \\\\nwell. You have been in touch with him personally. You have met \\\\nwith him. You have stayed in touch. And so thank you for your \\\\nresponse, also to this subcommittee including Mr. Joyce here \\\\nwho visited personally himself to find out what was going on. \\\\nAnd this committee and subcommittee responded in part by \\\\nplussing up our disaster relief fund, which needed to be done \\\\nin our last supplement all as well as the actions in the fiscal \\\\nyear 2024 bill.\\\\n    Aside from I think many positive areas of progress the one \\\\nthat is the missing piece is housing as you well know. The \\\\nhistory here is that the fires displaced about 12,000 people. \\\\nFour thousand of them went into some other form of housing very \\\\nunsatisfactory right away, and 8,000 went into hotel rooms \\\\nthemselves. Of that 8,000 we have still today about 2,800 \\\\nindividuals, about 1,100 families. They clearly don&#x27;t want to \\\\nbe in those hotels anymore, and neither does FEMA. You want to \\\\nmove them out of those hotels.\\\\n    And yet the very unique circumstances of the Maui housing \\\\nmarket make it very difficult for you to follow your kind of \\\\nstandard approach. FEMA has made choices in the past between \\\\nrehousing and rebuilding. You have chosen rehousing on Maui, \\\\nand I understand that, but that is not going to be all of the \\\\nsolution here. You actually do need some form of rebuilding to \\\\npull this off over time. It is not going to really do the job.\\\\n    The Hawaii delegation, the State of Hawaii, Mr. Bissen and \\\\nthe county involved asked FEMA to come off of the rehousing \\\\nexclusively solution here and instead move to the actual \\\\nconstruction of at least some temporary transitional housing on \\\\nland that the State of Hawaii is making available to you to do \\\\nthat, either the actual housing itself, which would be \\\\ntransitional, or at least the infrastructure for that housing \\\\nso that other people can take care of it and put in about 1,000 \\\\nunits that are desperately needed to cover a gap in the housing \\\\navailability.\\\\n    And that gap is caused not only by the shortage of housing \\\\non Maui in general but by the fact that there are many people \\\\nthat are being housed in hotels and otherwise that are not \\\\neligible for FEMA housing right now. They have been \\\\ndisqualified for many reasons. And so there is two solutions \\\\nhere. The rehousing exclusively is not going to work. The \\\\nrebuilding has to happen in some way, shape or form. Some \\\\ncombination of rebuilding, transitional housing and/or the \\\\nexercise of your waiver authority to allow the people that are \\\\nbeing disqualified from rehousing to actually get into that \\\\nrehousing market.\\\\n    I think this would be good all around. You certainly are \\\\nspending a heck of a lot of money that you don&#x27;t need to be \\\\nspending on some of these housing options that you have pursued \\\\nin a very tight market. So what can you tell us about your \\\\nthoughts in terms of the Maui wildfire overall? And again I say \\\\nthis in the context of sincere appreciation for your efforts.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, thank you very much for \\\\nrecognizing the extraordinary work of FEMA in close partnership \\\\nwith state and local officials. You correctly described the \\\\nhousing challenge following the tragic fires as extremely \\\\ncomplex and difficult, and we are looking at all our options \\\\nand also are eager to work with Congress to assist what \\\\nadditional authorities FEMA might need.\\\\n    We are working across the administration not just DHS \\\\nthrough FEMA but also with Housing and Urban Development, with \\\\neconomic experts to understand what is the right solution for \\\\nthe people of Maui, whether rehousing is inadequate, and \\\\ntherefore we have to rebuild. The challenges of rebuilding are \\\\ndifficult. Because of its island status and its unique \\\\nsituation as an extraordinary tourist destination the pricing \\\\nof housing is different than many other----\\\\n    Mr. Case. I appreciate that, Mr. Secretary. I&#x27;m sorry. My \\\\ntime is almost up, so apologies for interrupting you. I commend \\\\nyou on all those efforts, but we don&#x27;t have time. The answers \\\\nare pretty straightforward. You are never going to be able to \\\\nsatisfy this on a strict rehousing approach. There is not \\\\nenough housing in the overall market. You can&#x27;t leave people in \\\\nhotel rooms for another 6 months to a year while you figure \\\\nthis out with the economic experts.\\\\n    Some decision needs to be made on some form of rebuilding \\\\nand/or the waiver authority that will relieve the pressure on \\\\nthat rebuilding. So I commend that to you, will follow up with \\\\nyou personally. But again thank you very much for your efforts, \\\\nand we will stay in touch.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Thank you. I look forward to it.\\\\n    Mr. Case. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, sir. We now recognize the gentleman \\\\nMr. Cloud.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to start \\\\nwith a very simple question. What is the name of your \\\\ndepartment that you are the secretary of?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. The name of the department?\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. The department, yes.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. The Department of Homeland Security.\\\\n\\\\n                       U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENTS\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Department of Homeland Security. And your \\\\ndepartment was stood up when 19 foreign nationals \\\\nmisrepresented who they were and used our infrastructure and \\\\nour resources to bring a catastrophic attack of course on \\\\nSeptember 11. Now, your department is tasked with protecting \\\\nthe homeland, and you have done more to turn it into \\\\nprioritized processing than you have protection.\\\\n    When you talk to the Border Patrol agents in Texas who are \\\\ndoing a yeoman&#x27;s work and doing everything they can with what \\\\nthey are being faced with, they are very frustrated that they \\\\nhave been taken off their job of protecting our borders and \\\\nhave instead been put in the role of processing. Could you \\\\nspeak to any authorities that Congress has removed from you or \\\\nthe president since taking office?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Has Congress removed any authorities from you or \\\\nthe president since you have taken office?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, the----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. It is a yes or no question.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, the point that you make \\\\nwith respect to U.S. Border Patrol agents is exactly why----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. You are filibustering. I asked you a yes or no \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Has Congress removed any authorities from you or \\\\nthe president since you have taken office?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, the point that you make \\\\nwith respect to U.S. Border Patrol agents----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. The answer is no. I would also make the point \\\\nthat you have approximately 20 percent larger budget than Trump \\\\nhad. The president has made the point that he can&#x27;t secure the \\\\nborder. He can&#x27;t get down to--because he is waiting on Congress \\\\nto move, and I just point that out to belay that and to point \\\\nout the truth of the fact that he has every single authority as \\\\nPresident Trump. He has more resources at his disposal than \\\\nPresident Trump yet he has done everything he can to undermine \\\\nthe security of our border.\\\\n    Have you read the book Unrestricted Warfare or the \\\\npamphlet?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, what is your----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. It was a report that was written by two colonels \\\\nin the Chinese army.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, what is your substantive \\\\nquestion about the work of the Department of Homeland Security?\\\\n\\\\n                         BORDER SECURITY: CHINA\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. The question is--so is that a yes or no? No? In \\\\nthe pamphlet or the brochure, it is a couple hundred pages \\\\nlong, it talks about the fact that a country would be--to take \\\\nout the United States you would not try to use kinetic warfare. \\\\nYou would use things like abusing our legal system, attacks on \\\\nour infrastructure, terrorism, smuggling warfare, drug warfare, \\\\neconomic aid warfare, in other words, getting us to overuse and \\\\nto--the way we beat the Soviet Union was getting them to \\\\noverspend. It was economic collapse because we got in an arms \\\\nrace with them, and they couldn&#x27;t keep up economically.\\\\n    Right now we are wasting and spending money, and it is \\\\nleading to our demise. Right now the number one threat against \\\\nour country is our fiscal house. Do you have any concerns that \\\\nChina may be engaged with unrestricted warfare in our country?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, addressing the challenges \\\\nthat the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) poses is one of our \\\\nhighest priorities, and we have a number of lines of effort to \\\\naddress that whether that is enforcement of the Uyghur Forced \\\\nLabor Protection Act (UFLPA)----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. How many Chinese nationals have crossed our \\\\nborder in the last couple years?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas [continuing]. In the fight against \\\\nforced labor. Whether that is battling----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. That is not Homeland Security. I appreciate \\\\nthat, but that is not Homeland Security.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. We are tasked with enforcement of the \\\\nUFLPA, Congressman. Secondly----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. I am asking you about the border. How many \\\\nChinese nationals have crossed our border?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I would be pleased to provide that \\\\ndata----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. It is tens of thousands.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Secondly----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Tens of thousands.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Secondly, the threat of cyberattacks--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Right now crossing our border are tens of \\\\nthousands of Chinese nationals who are presently in our \\\\ncountry. They are primarily single adult male military aged, \\\\nand they have crossed our border, and you are not doing \\\\nanything to counteract that. You mentioned expanding lawful \\\\npathways. Who makes laws?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, if you must ask me \\\\nquestions the answers to which you know, allow me to answer it. \\\\nCongress.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you. You haven&#x27;t answered the other \\\\nquestions, so I will just point that out. The issue that we \\\\nhave when it comes to analyzing your budget, and this has been \\\\nthe difficult part, is we look at our budgets, and we want to \\\\nspend money to secure our border. And so we as Congress write \\\\nthe check for security, and then you get it and you turn it \\\\ninto processing, and you turn it into basically, human \\\\ntrafficking and aiding and abetting cartels and all the \\\\nnefarious action that has happened.\\\\n    So we have had 100,000 people killed from Fentanyl. The \\\\nprecursor is coming from China. That would be like a plane with \\\\n300 people a day dying in our country. Now we have cells within \\\\nour country who at any moment could strike our infrastructure \\\\nor the other ways of unrestricted warfare that I have \\\\nmentioned. I would urge you to get a focus on Homeland \\\\nSecurity, be focused on protection. Let us stop the funding for \\\\nthe unnecessary processing. Let us secure our border and put \\\\nback in place the policies that had led to a secure or almost \\\\nsecure border. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, sir. We now recognize the Ranking \\\\nMember of the entire committee, Ms. DeLauro.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very, very much, Mr. Chairman. I am \\\\nsorry to be running in and out, but it is the nature of the \\\\nbeast. So thank you. Thank you very much. And Mr. Secretary, \\\\nthank you very, very much.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Good morning.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you for your years of service to this \\\\ncountry. I said in a prior meeting to Secretary Cardona it was \\\\nShirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to sit in \\\\nthis body, that said that public service is the rent we pay for \\\\nspace on this earth. And as I said to Secretary Cardona who has \\\\nbeen paying the rent, you have been paying that rent over and \\\\nover again. So thank you so much for being here.\\\\n\\\\n                    SECURITY AND PROTECTION: GRANTS\\\\n\\\\n    I have a couple of FEMA questions if I can. FEMA Initiative \\\\nis the nonprofit security grant program funding not for profit \\\\norganizations making physical security, improvements to \\\\nfacilities at the high risk of terrorist attack. Particularly \\\\nfor years in the aftermath of conflict in Gaza I have been \\\\nconcerned, others are concerned about threats to temples, \\\\nmosques, churches, other places of worship. Glad to see the \\\\nprogram prioritized and supplemental funding requests received \\\\nadministration last fall though I do regret the program \\\\nreceived a cut as part of very difficult negotiations over the \\\\nHomeland bill just a few weeks ago.\\\\n    A couple of questions here. Has the Department assessed an \\\\nincrease in threats against places of worship in the aftermath \\\\nof October 7th? What other types of nonprofit facilities are \\\\nfacing acute threats of violence and could be served by this \\\\nprogram? Can you speak briefly to the 2025 request level for \\\\nthe program, $110.5 million increase above 2024 funding and \\\\nwhat that request would support in terms of meeting that need?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, the heightened threat \\\\nenvironment in which we currently live has only been \\\\nexacerbated by the October 7th terrorist attacks against the \\\\nstate of Israel. We have seen a dramatic increase in the rise \\\\nin antisemitism as well as Islamophobia. The NSGP provides much \\\\nneeded dollars to places of worship and other nonprofit \\\\norganizations such as synagogues, religious day schools, and \\\\nmosques, and that is precisely why our FY 2025 budget request \\\\nsees an augmentation of that grant program funding.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Would that allow additional grants to these \\\\nfacilities in order for security and protection?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. It would. Tragically, what we see are \\\\nincreasingly target rich and resource poor institutions, and \\\\nthe increase in funding would allow us to ensure \\\\nenfranchisement in our grant programs and better inclusivity to \\\\nbuild capacity where it does not currently exist. But we are \\\\nworking very closely with different communities, different \\\\nfaith communities, and different nonprofit organizations to \\\\nshare best practices and do what we can with the limited funds \\\\navailable to us.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. It is critically important in my community. I \\\\nhear from these organizations all of the time, many small \\\\norganizations but nevertheless under serious threat \\\\ncontinuously.\\\\n\\\\n                     NATURAL DISASTER: PREPAREDNESS\\\\n\\\\n    Let me move on to another FEMA question if I can, and I \\\\nwill try to be quick, Mr. Chairman. FEMA, by the way, is the \\\\nsingle largest part of the Homeland budget as I understand it. \\\\nIt plays an expansive role in keeping our community safe. It is \\\\nfirefighters, next generation warning system, preventing \\\\nviolence and terrorism talk about protecting our homeland, \\\\nHomeland Security, and responding to disasters, helping \\\\ncommunities recover, build back stronger.\\\\n    We have got extreme weather events, wildfires, hurricanes, \\\\nwinter storms threaten the infrastructure that we rely on every \\\\nday. Let me talk about Connecticut, across New England. \\\\nHistoric flooding. These events put people livelihoods and \\\\ntheir lives really at risk and create public health and public \\\\nsafety crisis. I would like to focus on prevention and pre-\\\\ndisaster mitigation.\\\\n    The sad reality is disasters are going to happen, so can we \\\\nspeak to the 2025 request for FEMA how you envision it should \\\\nbe focused on preparedness, protection, and mitigation? Where \\\\nare increased investments needed in order for you to support \\\\nthis work? What kind of policy changes should the Congress be \\\\nconsidering? Because yes indeed it is about homeland security. \\\\nThese are homeland security issues.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, I look forward to \\\\nworking with you on assessing what legislative changes are \\\\nneeded to better address the increasing impacts of climate \\\\nchange, and the increasing frequency and gravity of extreme \\\\nweather events. I have spoken with mayors around the country \\\\nabout the need to update building codes, something as basic as \\\\nthat. The building codes are addressing the weather of \\\\nyesterday and not the weather of today or tomorrow.\\\\n    I believe it is Colorado State University that just issued \\\\na report about its prediction for hurricane season, and it is \\\\nreally looking very, very troubling. An ounce of prevention \\\\ntoday is absolutely vital to preventing calamities in local \\\\ncommunities across this country. The situation is getting worse \\\\nfrom an extreme weather perspective, and we have to work with \\\\nevery community to ensure it understands what it needs to do \\\\nwith the funds that we distribute to it and the funds that they \\\\nthemselves have in terms of understanding how houses and \\\\nresidences of all types need to be prepared, need to be \\\\nsafeguarded and what people need to do should an extreme \\\\nweather event actually occur.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. I thank you, and I thank the Chair. I will \\\\njust make this final comment. I would very, very much like to \\\\nwork with you on this because I think the whole issue of FEMA \\\\nand its role in homeland security gets lost. It gets lost in a \\\\nwhole lot of, yes, serious issues but a whole lot of political \\\\nrhetoric as well. But this is I think an area where Congress \\\\nmay have the opportunity to do something and to do something in \\\\na bipartisan basis because these kinds of conditions affect all \\\\nof our communities. And I thank you. I thank you for your \\\\nindulgence, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. You are welcome, Ms. DeLauro. We now recognize \\\\nCongressman Newhouse.\\\\n\\\\n                       BORDER SECURITY: FENTANYL\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member. \\\\nMr. Secretary, thanks for being with us this morning. \\\\nAppreciate that very much. I want to discuss the Fentanyl \\\\ncrisis that we all know is raging throughout our country. \\\\nFentanyl floods across the Southwest border. It doesn&#x27;t stay in \\\\nborder communities, however. It spreads throughout the country \\\\nand is destroying lives. It is destroying families. It is \\\\ndestroying communities throughout the United States.\\\\n    In your testimony, you note that the department has stopped \\\\nmore elicit Fentanyl and arrested more individuals for Fentanyl \\\\nrelated crimes in the last two fiscal years than in the \\\\nprevious five years combined. While this is admirable it is \\\\nequally disturbing. The men and women of the CBP and ICE do \\\\nextraordinary work on the frontline and beyond to execute their \\\\nmission of protecting the homeland, and we all appreciate that.\\\\n    However, as Border Patrol agents are pulled off the \\\\nfrontline to process and then release the majority of illegal \\\\nmigrants into the United States the cartels being very clever, \\\\nthey have shifted their tactics to exploit the vulnerabilities \\\\nthat those personnel shifts and shortfalls have created. In \\\\nyour testimony you also note that in fiscal year 2025 the \\\\nbudget request includes critical investments in the fight \\\\nagainst fentanyl specifically the nonintrusive inspection \\\\ntechnology, and you mentioned that in your verbal testimony.\\\\n    Yet when I reviewed the budget justifications for that \\\\nprogram it says that the fiscal year 2025 budget does not \\\\nprovide procurement funding for this investment although it \\\\ndoes request level funding for operations in support. I didn&#x27;t \\\\nsee the roughly $300 million that purportedly is necessary to \\\\ninstall the scanners used to detect drugs and other contraband \\\\nthat have been purchased and are sitting in a warehouse that \\\\nare literally collecting dust as you and I are sitting here in \\\\nthis hearing room.\\\\n    This is something that just totally frustrates and concerns \\\\nme. When I visited the border in Arizona just this last \\\\nFebruary, one of your, our own border patrol agents, in answer \\\\nto my question, told me this directly. We do not control the \\\\nborder. The cartels control the border.\\\\n    The cartels determine who, when, and where people cross our \\\\nborder. Even more concerning, a local resident told me that him \\\\nand his neighbors don&#x27;t even lock their doors anymore because \\\\nsmugglers, illegal migrants, they come through the area, break \\\\ninto homes, take whatever they want, they steal clothing, they \\\\nsteal food.\\\\n    People have resorted to just leaving stuff out on their \\\\npatios and leaving their doors unlocked to try to prevent the \\\\ndamage of people breaking in. I think that&#x27;s just--to have \\\\nfellow citizens going through that on a daily basis to me is \\\\nunconscionable.\\\\n    This fentanyl epidemic, it&#x27;s fueled through the southwest \\\\nborder. Over 50 percent comes through Arizona alone. How can, \\\\nbetter yet, why can the Department justify this?\\\\n    Tell me, are you working with Mexican authorities? To do, \\\\nwhat I see are the two important things, stop Fentanyl \\\\nprecursors from coming from Mexico. And number two, prevent \\\\nwaves of migrants from physically rushing the border. What are \\\\nsome of the specific intangible actions?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I will answer very briefly \\\\nin the limited time we have, but I would welcome the \\\\nopportunity to speak with you, outside of this hearing, to talk \\\\nabout the work that we are doing with Mexico, both in the fight \\\\nagainst fentanyl and to ensure that individuals who seek to \\\\narrive at our border are interdicted before they reach our \\\\nborder.\\\\n    But we are working very closely with Mexico, and not only \\\\nwith Mexico, to interdict the flow of precursor chemicals, as \\\\nwell as the pill presses and other equipment used to \\\\nmanufacture fentanyl into this hemisphere.\\\\n    And I will share with you. I share your concern, \\\\nCongressman Newhouse, because for 12 years I was a Federal \\\\nprosecutor battling the trafficking of substances as serious as \\\\ncocaine and black tar heroin.\\\\n    And we have seen nothing like the toxicity and fatality of \\\\nfentanyl. And we have to battle it together. And this is a \\\\nscourge that has been growing for years. I believe it was in \\\\n2020, that there were 57,000 overdose deaths.\\\\n    This is not a new phenomenon. It is a years long \\\\nphenomenon. And we need to work together to address it.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Newhouse.\\\\n    We now recognize Mr. Guest.\\\\n\\\\n                             BUDGET REQUEST\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, the discretionary budget this year is $62.2 \\\\nbillion, is that correct?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I believe that&#x27;s correct.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. And the request last year was $60.4 billion as \\\\nit relates to discretionary spending; is that correct?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I believe so, Congressman.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. You stated in your opening statement that there \\\\nwas an insufficient budget, that we were not giving you the \\\\nfunds necessary for you to be able to carry out your job and \\\\nthe men and women who serve under you.\\\\n    Last year you requested $60.4 billion and Congress \\\\nappropriated $61.8 billion. So we actually appropriated more \\\\nmoney than you asked for.\\\\n    When you look at what you are asking for this year versus \\\\nwhat we appropriated last year, those numbers are very similar. \\\\nThere is not a huge discrepancy between $62.2 and $61.8 \\\\nbillion.\\\\n    And as I looked through the individual items that you \\\\nrequested, one of the things that Ms. Hinson brought up were \\\\ndetention beds. Congress, this year, funded 41,500 detention \\\\nbeds, but yet you are only requesting 34,000 detention beds.\\\\n    And you also referenced the Senate bill. In the Senate \\\\nbill, you said the Senate bill, which never passed out of the \\\\nSenate, but was a bill in which they were debating as part of \\\\nthe overall funding package you said would have funded 50,000 \\\\ndetention bets.\\\\n    And I am assuming you supported the Senate bill, did you \\\\nnot?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I hope you would have as well, \\\\nCongressman.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Well, if it would have come over here, I would \\\\nhave been happy to have looked at it, but unfortunately, it \\\\nnever made it out of the Senate, so the House did not have a \\\\nchance to review the legislation.\\\\n\\\\n        U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: DETENTION BEDS\\\\n\\\\n    So do you support then the 50,000 detention beds that would \\\\nhave been in the Senate bill?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. In the context of the bipartisan Senate \\\\nbill, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. All right. But yet, you are asking for some \\\\n16,000 less detention beds and, actually, 7,500 less detention \\\\nbeds than we currently fund.\\\\n    And you talk about expedited removal, and you say that \\\\npeople who are in detention often have expedited removal. And \\\\nso if the intent is to, those individuals who don&#x27;t need to be \\\\nhere, to remove them from the country sooner rather than later, \\\\nand we know about the immigration courts and the backlog and \\\\nall the problems that we face, putting people in detention \\\\nexpedites their removal from the country generally, does it \\\\nnot?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, a few things. Number 1, \\\\nremember that when we fund detention beds, we also have to fund \\\\npersonnel. It is part of a----\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Do you need more money for personnel? I want to \\\\nknow what you need to fund more detention beds, because to me \\\\nit seems asinine, Mr. Secretary, that we are going to ask for \\\\nless detention beds when we see a record surge in immigration, \\\\nwhen we see a record number of orders of removal that have been \\\\nissued by the court. But yet, we are saying that we don&#x27;t need \\\\ndetention beds if we are going to, one, prevent people from \\\\ncoming into the country or if we are not going to prevent them \\\\nonce they are here and once there is a final disposition of \\\\ntheir case, if we are going to seek to remove them.\\\\n    And I am very concerned about that fact. I am very \\\\nconcerned that you are asking not only for less than we funded \\\\nthis year, but you are asking for substantially less than the \\\\nSenate bill which you said that you agreed with.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, a few points. Number 1, as \\\\nI articulated earlier, our FY 2025 budget request was submitted \\\\nbefore Congress passed the FY 2024 budget.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. What number do you need? Is 34,000, is that the \\\\nnumber that you need right now?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. We are committed to working with \\\\nCongress to sustain the 41,500 beds that were funded.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. If that is the number, why didn&#x27;t you put that \\\\nin your budget? Why are you substantially underselling the \\\\nnumber of detention beds and then making Congress come in and \\\\nbump those numbers up?\\\\n    If those are the numbers you need? If those are the \\\\nappropriate numbers, Mr. Secretary, I would ask that you put \\\\nthose numbers actually in your budget and that you ask Congress \\\\nto fund that and that you don&#x27;t expect us, that we are just \\\\ngoing to plus up those numbers and so you leave those numbers \\\\nartificially low.\\\\n\\\\n                      BORDER SECURITY: IMMIGRATION\\\\n\\\\n    Now, one last thing, and I know my time is running short. \\\\nSo in an effort to make sure that I save time for other \\\\nmembers, Fox News is reporting that there is going to be a \\\\npossible executive order issued by the President.\\\\n    This says to shut down the border by the end of the month. \\\\nAre you aware, are you in any discussions with the President \\\\nabout executive orders that would relate to border security \\\\nand/or immigration?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, we are consistently \\\\nevaluating what options are available to us. We do that on a \\\\nregular basis. I will share with you that executive action, \\\\nwhich is inevitably challenged in the courts, is no substitute \\\\nfor an enduring solution, if I may, for the enduring solution \\\\nof legislation that will fix what everyone agrees is a broken \\\\nimmigration system.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. And as a Secretary, do you believe that the \\\\nPresident has the power to issue executive orders that would \\\\ndeal with border security and/or immigration?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. We have actually implemented executive \\\\norders by way of very critical and effective regulations, and I \\\\nwould be pleased to speak with you about those.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, sir.\\\\n    We now recognize Dr. Harris.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Thank you very much. And first at the top, I \\\\nwant to make sure that you convey my thanks to the Coast Guard \\\\nfor what they are doing in the port of Baltimore.\\\\n    Their response was tremendous. I mean, getting that port \\\\nreopened is important. Obviously, it&#x27;s a multi-agency effort. \\\\nCoast Guard is playing a very important role, as well as the \\\\nArmy Corps of Engineers. I want to convey my thanks.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Thank you, Congressman. I will do so.\\\\n\\\\n                    JANUARY 6: UNDERCOVER OPERATIVES\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Now, I am going to ask you a question that has \\\\ncome up, because, you know, the FBI director has testified \\\\nbefore Congress that he wasn&#x27;t certain whether or not there \\\\nwere undercover operatives, FBI operatives working on January \\\\n6th in the crowd.\\\\n    But an undercover journalist with Sound Investigations \\\\nreleased a video you may be aware of in the last 2 days of a \\\\nCIA official, former FBI member, actually saying, yes, there \\\\nwere.\\\\n    So I am going to ask you a simple question. Were there \\\\nundercover officers or agents from the Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity or paid informants in the crowd on January 6?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I don&#x27;t know the answer to \\\\nthat question. I will follow up with you.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Wow, is all I can say. Was Ray Epps a paid \\\\ninformant?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I&#x27;m not familiar with \\\\nthose facts. I&#x27;d be very pleased to get them to you.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Thank you very much. And is it the policy of \\\\nthe Department of Homeland Security, because I understand it is \\\\nthe policy of the FBI, to actually have undercover individuals \\\\nat these events, to kind of keep them in control, to allow \\\\npeople to peacefully exert their first amendment rights while \\\\nkind of, you know, calling attention to people who might \\\\ninterfere with that.\\\\n    So is it the policy of the Department of Homeland Security \\\\nto have undercover agents or officers or paid informants at \\\\nevents like that?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Events like?\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Like a large protest somewhere where people \\\\nattempt to exert their first amendment rights?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, that is not where we focus \\\\nour----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK, but if you get the answers to me on the \\\\nother one, I&#x27;d appreciate that. About January 6, whether or not \\\\nyou had agents there.\\\\n\\\\n          INFORMATION SHARING: OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL\\\\n\\\\n    OK, let me talk a little bit about the OIG. The OIG has \\\\ncomplained that they attempt to get things from the Department \\\\nof Homeland Security. I am going to ask this letter to Chairman \\\\nGreen from January 17, from the OIG, to be entered into the \\\\nrecord, where she points out that the Department, over the past \\\\nfew years, has used the excuse of the Privacy Act and the \\\\nPresidential Records Act to withhold information from the OIG.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Harris. Now, the purpose of the OIG, as you know, is \\\\nCongress, we think the OIGs are important to keep an eye on the \\\\nindividual departments, and we would hope that the departments \\\\nwould always cooperate with their OIGs because otherwise looks \\\\na little suspicious.\\\\n    So do you agree that the Privacy Act and the Presidential \\\\nRecords Act, in fact, do not affect the ability of the \\\\ndepartment to transfer information to the OIG?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, let me assure you that we \\\\ncooperate fully with the Office of Inspector General, and we \\\\nalso appreciate the importance of the Inspector Generals in \\\\nmaking sure the Department is as efficient and effective as it \\\\ncan be.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Is your inspector General Joseph Cuffari?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Yes, he is.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. But in this letter, he says you are not \\\\ncooperating.\\\\n    I will enter into, Mr. Chairman, without objection, I would \\\\nlike that entered into the record.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I respectfully disagree \\\\nwith the Inspector General.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Well, that is why we have Inspector Generals, \\\\nto actually keep an eye on the departments. And we expect when \\\\nthe department is doing something that they want to cover up \\\\nthat they are not going to cooperate with the Inspector \\\\nGeneral, and then they are going to claim that they cooperate \\\\nwith the Inspector General.\\\\n    That is our cop on the beat. That is our cop on the beat \\\\nwatching the cops on the beat. OK?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, assuredly, you are \\\\nspeaking of a Department different than ours when you \\\\ncharacterize that type of behavior.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. That is not what the letter kind of indicates.\\\\n    Anyway, the last thing I want to talk about in the last \\\\nremaining minute is the effect of offshore wind on search and \\\\nrescue missions for the Coast Guard, because this is an issue.\\\\n    We have an active port in Ocean City. We have a lot of \\\\ncommercial fishermen and private people who are worried that \\\\nwhen they construct these huge offshore windmills off the coast \\\\nof Maryland, that, in fact, Coast Guard search and rescue \\\\noperations will be harmed.\\\\n    So I am going to ask to enter into the record a U.S. Naval \\\\nInstitute&#x27;s study on offshore wind energy, a rising challenge \\\\nto Coast Guard operations that indicates the potential effects \\\\nof these on search and rescue missions.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Harris. Clearly, an important part of what the Coast \\\\nGuard does, and clearly, preserving life and limb in the \\\\nmaritime environment should be one of the first things the \\\\nGovernment does before it expends huge amounts of money on \\\\noffshore wind, a very expensive source of energy, but that is a \\\\ndiscussion for a different agency.\\\\n    I also want to ask if you could follow up with the Coast \\\\nGuard. There is a November 25, 2019, letter which, again, I \\\\nwill ask to be entered into the record, signed by the Director, \\\\nJennifer William, Captain Jennifer William, Director of Marine \\\\nTransportation System, acting, U.S. Coast Guard, where she \\\\nsuggested that ongoing studies are done, are being done, this \\\\nis now 5 years ago, 4\\\\\\\\1/2\\\\\\\\ years ago, with regards to the \\\\nsafety of offshore wind vis-a-vis search and rescue missions of \\\\nthe Coast Guard.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Harris. Are you aware whether or not that determination \\\\nhas been made? Whether it has been safe?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I would be pleased to follow up with \\\\nyou, Congressman.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Thank you very much. And again, I ask that \\\\nwould be entered into the record, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. The objection, and all exhibits are admitted \\\\nwithout objection.\\\\n    Should the members desire, proceed with the second round. \\\\nThree minutes. OK.\\\\n\\\\n                          BORDER WALL: FUNDING\\\\n\\\\n    Recognizing myself. Congress provided more than $5.8 \\\\nbillion for the border wall, but your agency continues to waste \\\\nmoney appropriated in FY 2020 and 2021, explicitly for barrier \\\\nconstruction, on everything but the actual construction of the \\\\nwall.\\\\n    This administration finally admitted that the FY 2019 funds \\\\nwere not spent on the wall, as Congress intended, they would be \\\\nbreaking the law.\\\\n    As a result of the lawsuit, you can no longer waste \\\\nadditional money on make safe projects and other non-wall \\\\nconstructions. Why won&#x27;t this administration follow the clear \\\\nand unambiguous intent of Congress and build additional miles \\\\nof wall with the roughly $600 million left in the wall account?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Mr. Chairman, I won&#x27;t speak to the \\\\nTexas court decision because that is a matter of ongoing \\\\nlitigation. But let me assure you that we do comply with the \\\\nlaw.\\\\n    As a matter of fact, because of our understanding of the \\\\nlegal imperative, we approved the construction of 17 miles of \\\\nwall. We did that last year. In addition, I have approved, I \\\\nbelieve it is 129, I may have the exact number inaccurate, but \\\\nI believe I am right, 129 gates, gap closures, and reforms.\\\\n    And so, we are complying with the law. But we continue to \\\\nbelieve that technology is a far more advanced capability that \\\\nwe need to invest in to ensure the security of our border.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. On my trips to the border, sir, I have seen wall \\\\nparts stacked, not being constructed. So I am wondering just \\\\nhow much money it costs the department to cancel those \\\\ncontracts midstream when taking into account additional work \\\\nthat needs to be done, such as stabilizing roads, drainage, and \\\\nother mitigation efforts?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, Mr. Chairman. Forgive me, \\\\nMr. Chairman----\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Fair enough.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas [continuing]. I am pleased to provide \\\\nyou with the figures you&#x27;ve requested.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you.\\\\n    I now recognize the distinguished Ranking Member, Mr. \\\\nCuellar.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n\\\\n                          IMMIGRATION: ASYLUM\\\\n\\\\n    You have been to Texas. You have seen the border wall, the \\\\nlevee walls that we have up there. When somebody is asking for \\\\nasylum, don&#x27;t they all have to do is just touch the riverbank?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Once they step on U.S. soil, Ranking \\\\nMember Cuellar, they have a lawful right to claim asylum.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And since we have a 1,200 mile river, the \\\\nfences that we have are not in the middle of the river, which \\\\nis really the international boundary. They are not at the \\\\nriverbanks, but they are actually a quarter mile or even longer \\\\naway, correct?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. In certain places, that is indeed \\\\ncorrect.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK, thank you. Let me ask you, according to \\\\nthe numbers that I have seen from you, all, most of the drugs \\\\nthat we have coming in are coming through ports of entry.\\\\n    Meth, cocaine, fentanyl. Up to 94 percent are coming \\\\nthrough ports of entry; is that correct?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. With respect to the southern border? \\\\nYes, that is correct. I believe it is--our data, our \\\\nintelligence and analysis demonstrate that approximately 90 \\\\npercent, if not more, of the drugs arriving in the country \\\\nthrough the border, are smuggled in through the POEs.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. So I certainly ask you that whatever monies \\\\nthat we added for technology, the non-intrusive, move on that \\\\nas much as possible so we can have them not only at the ports \\\\nof entry, but also in the border patrol checkpoints also. I \\\\nwould ask you to move those as soon as possible.\\\\n    And according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 86 percent \\\\nto 87 percent of the people are smuggling drugs at the ports of \\\\nentry or at the checkpoints or U.S. citizens, correct?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I&#x27;m not certain about the precise \\\\npercentage, but I do understand that the data evidences that \\\\nthe majority are U.S. citizens.\\\\n\\\\n                           EXPEDITED REMOVAL\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. The last numbers I saw were about 86, 87 \\\\npercent U.S. citizens.\\\\n    Now, let me go back to, I am a big believer in expedited, \\\\ntitle 8 expedited. What resources, I will ask you again, like \\\\nmore asylum officers, space do you need so we can do expedited \\\\nremovals under title 8?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Ranking Member Cuellar, in addition to \\\\nadditional legal authority, which we would have been provided \\\\nunder the bipartisan legislation, many more asylum officers, \\\\nI&#x27;m sorry, enforcement and removal officers in ICE, additional \\\\npersonnel, additional CBP personnel, and additional facilities.\\\\n    And those are some of the highlights, with respect to what \\\\nwe need, but underlying it is the additional legal authority \\\\nthat the bipartisan legislation would have delivered.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And we certainly want to provide you the \\\\nfunding. Again, I just have to say this, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    The two last appropriation bills where we added $1.4 \\\\nbillion to CBP, every single person on the other side of the \\\\naisle, except for two that are still in Congress, voted no for \\\\nthat extra money.\\\\n    This last appropriations bill, where we added the largest \\\\namount to CBP, I think less than half of the majority voted for \\\\nfunding. So we got to make sure that we all work together to do \\\\nbipartisan funding to give you this.\\\\n    Now, the last question on expedited removal. Again, I \\\\nbelieve in expedited removal. title 8, it was used very \\\\neffectively when you were with the Obama administration under \\\\nSecretary Jay Johnson.\\\\n    You said that the only way we can use CBP removal or title \\\\n8 is if they are under CBP custody. Would a monitoring system \\\\nstill be under CBP? And I guess you can&#x27;t answer that, but I \\\\nwant you to think about it, then go back to your attorneys to \\\\nsee if you can use title 8 Expedited Removal because custody \\\\nmeans probably under, you know, ICE or CBP facility.\\\\n    But we do use monitoring, and I would ask you to see if you \\\\ncan look at that, whether that would be custody, which in my \\\\nopinion I would say yes and see if you can use title 8 \\\\nExpedited Removal.\\\\n    And again, anything that we can change the law. And I don&#x27;t \\\\nknow what you all looking at the executive order, but we do \\\\nknow that at the very beginning a lot of those people don&#x27;t \\\\nqualify.\\\\n    They do not qualify without due respect. If they are \\\\nhungry, they want a job, they want to come to the U.S. or the \\\\nChinese city on top of the hill. I understand that. But they \\\\ndon&#x27;t qualify under the five persecutions under asylum law.\\\\n    So we want to work with you and we want to support them. \\\\nAnd again, you have a very difficult job. There are so many \\\\nopinions here. You know, you get attacked because you do too \\\\nmuch or you get attacked for not doing enough.\\\\n    But I do want to say, I want to thank you for your service \\\\nand I want to thank the men and women that work on your \\\\ndepartment. Thank you.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. God bless.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    We now recognize Ms. Hinson.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n\\\\n                           IMMIGRATION: CHINA\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, last year when you came before this \\\\nSubcommittee, I did ask you about concerning reports of Chinese \\\\nnationals crossing our open border. I brought this concern to \\\\nyou directly Mr. Secretary, because President Biden did not do \\\\nanything to prevent this issue. It has become worse.\\\\n    And now Chinese nationals, as you may be aware, are the \\\\nlargest and fastest growing group attempting to cross into our \\\\ncountry. But I am concerned that your testimony in your budget \\\\ndoes not acknowledge that fact or directly do anything to \\\\naddress it; is that correct?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Oh, Congresswoman, let me be clear. \\\\nNumber 1, any individual who poses a threat to public safety or \\\\nnational security is a priority for detention. Number 1. Number \\\\n2, for the first time I had an engagement with my counterpart \\\\nfrom the PRC to ensure that China would begin to accept removal \\\\nflights so that we can deliver a consequence regime for \\\\nindividuals from the PRC who do not have a legal basis to be--\\\\n--\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. What was the outcome of that conversation?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas [continuing]. Who do not have a legal \\\\nbasis to remain in the United States. And those discussions are \\\\nongoing. And we actually did effect one flight, most recently, \\\\nfor the first time in a number of years.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Unfortunately, we have to judge the Chinese \\\\nCommunist Party based upon their actions and not their words. \\\\nWe know just recently, two Chinese nationals were arrested in \\\\nIowa on a nationwide fraud case they were involved in.\\\\n    One of them was believed to have crossed the southwest \\\\nborder and was released into the country. And they made their \\\\nway to Iowa and joined in this national fraud activity.\\\\n    And I know Iowans and Americans do deserve transparency and \\\\naccountability for all of your Department&#x27;s actions which have \\\\nessentially alerted our adversaries that our borders are wide \\\\nopen, allowing criminals to enter our country and make their \\\\nway into Iowa.\\\\n    I don&#x27;t think there is an excuse for having the same \\\\nconversation 2 years in a row. And I would like to see more \\\\nstringent action from the administration concerning Chinese \\\\nCommunist Party nationals coming across our border.\\\\n\\\\n                            BORDER SECURITY\\\\n\\\\n    Another action I find distressing is that the \\\\nadministration is diverting a record number of Federal Air \\\\nMarshals to the southwest border to perform administrative \\\\nduties.\\\\n    This leaves Americans unguarded on commercial flights. I \\\\nspoke directly with the Air Marshals about the safety concerns \\\\nposed by diverting them to the southern border, allowing for a \\\\nshortage of Air Marshals on flights, denying them their sworn \\\\nduty to protect Americans in the air.\\\\n    So Mr. Secretary, you dance around calling the crisis at \\\\nour southern border not only a humanitarian crisis, but a \\\\ncrisis. So if you do not see it as that, why are you deploying \\\\nour Federal Air Marshals, our FAMs to the border, and other law \\\\nenforcement agencies to the border?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, I do understand the \\\\nchallenges at the border, and I certainly don&#x27;t dance around \\\\nthem. As a matter of fact----\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Would you call it a crisis at the southern \\\\nborder?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Yes, I would. And as a matter of fact, \\\\nI work every single day with the men and women in the \\\\nDepartment to only strengthen the security of our southern \\\\nborder as well as the northern border.\\\\n    And we deploy personnel from different parts of the \\\\nDepartment whenever the situation so warrants. And the \\\\nsituation at the border so warrants.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. When I look at my visits to the southern \\\\nborder, I have been twice I had a chance to meet with the brave \\\\nmen and women at the CBP as well as some ICE agents. But I was \\\\nincreasingly disturbed by how many you are pulling from other \\\\nagencies, not just our FAMs, but also from TSA and FEMA.\\\\n    So again, I think that--I am pleased to hear you call it a \\\\ncrisis. I think it is the first time I have heard you publicly \\\\nacknowledge it. But I think that we continue to put Americans \\\\nlives at risk by pulling these Federal Air Marshals off of \\\\nthese flights, again, leaving them uncovered.\\\\n    I think that the Federal Air Marshals certainly \\\\ncommunicated to me that they have had enough of this. They see \\\\nit as deception and harmful action. So I will continue working \\\\nto prohibit the ability to deploy those necessary air marshals \\\\ndown to the border.\\\\n    They need to be back on flights, Mr. Secretary, until you \\\\nagain certify that the border is in a crisis state. So thank \\\\nyou so much for appearing before our committee today. I yield \\\\nback.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Ms. Hinson.\\\\n    At this point, Mr. Guest, do you have any further \\\\nquestions?\\\\n\\\\n                   ILLEGAL MIGRATION: RATE OF RELEASE\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Mayorkas, it was reported, or excuse me, Secretary \\\\nMayorkas, I apologize. It was reported in January of this year \\\\nthat at a meeting with Border Patrol agents that you said that \\\\nthe current rate of release for illegal immigrants apprehended \\\\nat the southwest border is above 85 percent.\\\\n    One, did that conversation take place? And two, is that \\\\nnumber accurate?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I&#x27;m not familiar with that \\\\nnumber, and I&#x27;m not certain to which conversation you refer. I \\\\nhave visited the border so very many times. Perhaps some \\\\nadditional details would guide me in responding to your \\\\nquestion accurately.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Yes, sir. And I will read from the article. It \\\\nwas a Fox News article, headlines Mayorkas tells Border Patrol \\\\nagents that above 85 percent of illegal immigrants released in \\\\nthe United States.\\\\n    And it says that was published on January 8, 2024. Homeland \\\\nSecurity Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday admitted to \\\\nBorder Patrol agents at the current rate of release for illegal \\\\nimmigrants apprehended at the southwest border is above 85 \\\\npercent, sources told Fox News.\\\\n    Mayorkas made the remarks when meeting privately with \\\\nagents in Eagle Pass, TX, according to three border patrol \\\\nsources who were in the room and heard the remarks marks \\\\nthemselves.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I&#x27;ll be pleased to provide \\\\nyou with the data point, and certainly I don&#x27;t view that \\\\narticle as a transcript.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Yeah, I guess my question is, is that figure of \\\\n85 percent, is it accurate?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I&#x27;ll have to follow up with you, \\\\nCongressman, and provide you with the data you request. I don&#x27;t \\\\nhave at my fingertips that data point.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. So you are not disputing this article? You are \\\\nnot saying that that number is artificially high? You&#x27;re just \\\\nsaying at this point that you don&#x27;t have that number here to \\\\neither admit or deny the 85 percent that it was alleged there \\\\nin the article?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I cannot confirm and I will do so.\\\\n\\\\n                       BORDER SECURITY: TITLE 42\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Mr. Secretary, we have, in previous \\\\nconversations, discussed title 42, title 8. As we know, title \\\\n42 expired in May of last year.\\\\n    We saw a brief dip in apprehensions late May, early June, \\\\nand we saw the numbers rise significantly after that. We saw, \\\\nin December, the number of apprehensions, on both the northern \\\\nand southern border were, if my numbers are correct, roughly \\\\n370,000 immigrants who would have entered the country just in \\\\nthe month of December alone.\\\\n    And so if this number is accurate, if 85 percent of those \\\\nindividuals who attempt to enter are actually released into \\\\ncustody, that would put the number at roughly 315,000 just in \\\\nDecember alone.\\\\n    And so these numbers, to me, are very troubling in that we \\\\nseem to have a large number of immigrants continue to come in \\\\nthe country after 42 expired. There were some conversations \\\\nthat you had testifying that you believe that once we began \\\\nprosecuting immigrants under title 8 versus title 42, that we \\\\nwould see those numbers drop, because part of the argument \\\\nunder title 42 was we were deporting immigrants back to their \\\\ncountry of origin or back into Mexico, and they were then \\\\nimmediately returning back across the border with no \\\\nconsequences.\\\\n    And so now that 42 has expired and we are operating only \\\\nunder title 8, I have not seen a decrease in the numbers \\\\nwhatsoever. If anything, we have seen those numbers increase.\\\\n    And so can you explain to me, now that 42 has expired and \\\\nwe don&#x27;t have that revolving door of immigrants being \\\\napprehended, returned to Mexico, and then coming right back in \\\\nthe country, why we can&#x27;t seem to get any relief?\\\\n    Why we continue to see, is what you have referred to the \\\\nfirst time I ever heard you refer to it as a crisis. I have \\\\nheard you repeatedly say this is not a crisis and that the \\\\nborder is secure. I think this is the first time that you have \\\\nsaid that.\\\\n    I know that the President said that, I believe, in January. \\\\nNot only did he say the border was not secure, he said that it \\\\nhad not been secured in a decade, which would have been the \\\\nentire time in which has been President and including time in \\\\nwhich he was Vice President in the Obama administration.\\\\n    And so now that 42 has expired, now that we are cooperating \\\\nunder title 8, now that we are continuing to fund the \\\\nDepartment of Homeland Security in amounts in excess that you \\\\nasked for, what more do we need to do to be able to secure our \\\\nborder?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, first of all, it is not \\\\nthe first time I have used that terminology. I would be \\\\npleased, we do not have the time right now, but I would be \\\\npleased to explain to you why the numbers were as high as they \\\\nwere in December and why they are significantly lower since \\\\nthen. There are clear reasons for that.\\\\n    And what we need to strengthen the security of the border \\\\nis to pass the bipartisan legislation that would provide us \\\\nwith the legal tools and the resources to address what everyone \\\\nagrees is a broken immigration system.\\\\n    There has not been, in my time in DHS, which is more than \\\\n10 years now, nor in my time in the Federal Government, which \\\\nis approximately 22 years now, 12 of which were spent as a \\\\nFederal prosecutor, have I seen a proposal that is as tough on \\\\nthe border and to strengthen the security as this bipartisan \\\\npiece of legislation.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Guest. I remind everyone on the \\\\npanel here the second round is supposed to be three minutes, \\\\nalthough our clock is showing up 5 minutes. So in order we can \\\\ntake care of everybody--and my sincere apologies, Ms. \\\\nUnderwood----\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce [continuing]. For skipping over her in trying to \\\\nbe unbiased here and making sure we have equal representation \\\\non both sides. Please, your next question.\\\\n\\\\n                               JANUARY 6\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. OK, thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, who was the Secretary of Homeland Security \\\\non January 6, 2021?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. January 6, 2021 was that Acting \\\\nSecretary Wolf, I believe?\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Yes, sir. But you were not Homeland Security \\\\nSecretary on that date?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. No, I assumed office on February 2nd of \\\\n2021.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas, your tenure at the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security has been historic in so many ways. You faced \\\\nso many challenges and a really complicated threat environment. \\\\nAnd at the same time during your tenure, DHS has seized over \\\\n43,000 pounds of fentanyl last year alone, ensured the safety \\\\nand security of nearly 850 million travelers in 2023, which was \\\\na record-setting year in air travel. You have exceeded your \\\\ngoal of new hires for women in law enforcement. You have worked \\\\nto keep our kids safe by identifying or rescuing over 11,000 \\\\nchild victims on online sexual exploitation and abuse.\\\\n    And yet, you have faced an unprecedented, vicious, and \\\\npersonal campaign against you and your staff at the Department \\\\nof Homeland Security from my colleagues on the right, and even \\\\na baseless impeachment effort.\\\\n    DHS is charged with work that is both difficult and \\\\nessential, keeping Americans safe. And I want to thank you for \\\\nyour commitment to doing that important job and doing it with \\\\nthe focus and care and attention that we expect of our leaders \\\\nin this country.\\\\n    Thank you very much for your service, sir.\\\\n\\\\n                      IMMIGRATION PROCESSING TIMES\\\\n\\\\n    I also just want to make a comment about the delayed \\\\nprocessing times for immigration applications at the \\\\nDepartment, which has been a repeated concern for my \\\\nconstituents in northern Illinois. Every day, our office hears \\\\nmore news about the delay in DACA renewals, work authorization \\\\nfor eligible migrants, and concerns about the naturalization \\\\nprocess for those who are eligible.\\\\n    And, you know, we encourage people to pursue a legal means \\\\nof immigration. But we must also ensure that our processes are \\\\ntimely and responsive throughout that process. So last year, \\\\nDHS introduced an update to the Equity Action Plan. And in the \\\\nupdate, there was a significant gap between the annual \\\\nnaturalization rate and the annual size of the population \\\\neligible to naturalize. And so in that report, there are some \\\\nbarriers that were mentioned. So lack of understanding of the \\\\nnaturalization process, real or perceived inability to meet the \\\\nEnglish language requirement, as well as the lack of ability to \\\\npay application fees.\\\\n    And I am concerned that this means that migrants from non-\\\\nEnglish speaking countries, particularly migrants of color, are \\\\nespecially vulnerable to pitfalls in our process, in our \\\\nnaturalization process. And so I would just ask that you direct \\\\nUSCIS to take a look at that naturalization gap for English and \\\\nnon-English speakers, and also take a look at what is going on \\\\nwith the DACA recipients. And we will submit something really \\\\nspecific for the record. But if you can direct them to follow \\\\nup with us, that would be really helpful.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Ms. Underwood.\\\\n    I now recognize Dr. Harris.\\\\n\\\\n                               JANUARY 6\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK, thank you very much, and thank you Mr. \\\\nSecretary.\\\\n    First of all, just to follow up on the January 6 thing, you \\\\nwere the secretary while the investigation, congressional \\\\ninvestigation went on, when the whole question of paid \\\\ninformants and embedded federal agents was brought up, is that \\\\nright?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Are you referring to the Special \\\\nCommittee and----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Yeah, the special, quote, bipartisan committee.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. That is what I thought. So you are well aware \\\\nof the controversies involved with the idea of federal agents \\\\nembedded, or paid informants, and the whole Ray Epps thing.\\\\n\\\\n    EXECUTIVE ORDER: IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT SECTION 212(F)\\\\n\\\\n    All right, let me just clear up the 212(f) issue right now, \\\\nbecause the President is the one who raised it now, because \\\\napparently he is going to issue some kind of executive order. \\\\nAnd I am assuming he had the same authority to issue that \\\\nexecutive order three years ago before nine million people \\\\nentered the country. I settlement right?\\\\n    I mean, he is going to issue it tomorrow. And the gentleman \\\\nraised a perfectly valid question. Like, our laws did not \\\\nchange in the past three years. Because Congress did not do \\\\nanything. God knows Congress did not do anything on \\\\nimmigration. So I am assuming we are operating under the same \\\\nset of laws.\\\\n    So I just find it a little coincidental that, you know, \\\\nseven months before an election where the President is down in \\\\nthe polls and immigration is the top issue, that the President \\\\ngets religion on this.\\\\n    So has the feeling in the administration changed on 212(f)? \\\\nBecause we always asserted on our side of the aisle that the \\\\nPresident had authority on 212(f). We know, because President \\\\nTrump exerted the authority. And has the President sought your \\\\nopinion on this, on his announcement last night? Has the \\\\nPresident sought the opinion of his secretary on this?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, let me share with you one \\\\nfact, and that is----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Sir, I only have 1 minute, 10 seconds left. Did \\\\nthe President seek your opinion on his announcement last night \\\\nthat there is going to be executive order regarding his \\\\nauthorities under 212(f)?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. That was not the President&#x27;s \\\\nannouncement last night, No. 1.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK----\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Number 2, the--the prior----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK, on to the next question. Because I am not \\\\ngoing to let you filibuster that. That was his announcement \\\\nlast night. It is reported in Axios, widely reported today.\\\\n    My question was just, did he consult you? I think it is a \\\\nsimple question. I think you are being very evasive about it. \\\\nAnd I am going to leave it at that.\\\\n    Now, with regards to ICE detentions, in Montgomery County, \\\\nMaryland, Montgomery County officials twice had a person who \\\\nwas issued detainers under ICE twice released from prison, now \\\\ncharged in the murder of a 2-year-old. Twice.\\\\n    What is this administration does to go to local \\\\njurisdictions and convince them to comply with detainers? \\\\nBecause, as the gentleman from Texas indicated, the title of \\\\nyour department is Homeland Security. I would assume protecting \\\\nAmericans from illegal immigrants with detainer orders, \\\\nscheduled for deportation, is something--who go on to kill \\\\nsomeone, is something the administration might be interested in \\\\nhaving. So what are you doing to convince local jurisdictions \\\\nlike Montgomery County to actually cooperate, not be a \\\\nsanctuary jurisdiction, and cooperate with detainer orders to \\\\nget these dangerous individuals off our streets?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, we continue to work with \\\\nlocal jurisdictions to persuade them that when an individual \\\\nposes a threat to public safety and the individual has a \\\\ndetainer placed on him or her, that they honor the detainer and \\\\nnot release the individual onto the streets, but rather turn \\\\nthe individual over to ICE for continued detention.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, may I have a 30-second privilege to answer--\\\\nto respond to----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. I will ask for the same 30-second privilege.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. The prior administration executed what \\\\nit believed to be its authority under 212(f) and the courts \\\\nenjoined it.\\\\n\\\\n        U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: 287(G) PROGRAM\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Claiming my 30 seconds, has the number of \\\\njurisdictions in the United States cooperating with the 287(g) \\\\nprogram increased or decreased under this administration?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I am not aware of an increase, any \\\\nincrease, Congressman.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. So you think it might have decreased, actually?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. No, I will stand by my statement.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Wow. If you can get me the details, I would \\\\nappreciate it. Because for all the bluster about actually \\\\nconvincing local authorities to cooperate, the most obvious \\\\nsign would be that the number of 287(g) local authorities \\\\nincreased, if the administration was doing anything about it.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Dr. Harris. Mr. Newhouse.\\\\n\\\\n                   AGRICULTURAL GUEST WORKER PROGRAM\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, by statute, your agency as well as the \\\\nDepartment of Labor administer the H-2A agricultural guest \\\\nworker program. Based on recent DOL rulemakings that farmers \\\\nacross the country are burdened with, DOL appears to at least \\\\nnot understand or not fully appreciate the importance of the \\\\nagricultural industry.\\\\n    I for one, however, would like to believe that you do, that \\\\nyou understand the importance of growing healthy foods in the \\\\nUnited States, which aligns with your agency&#x27;s guiding \\\\nprinciples and responsibility to preserve and uphold the \\\\nnation&#x27;s prosperity and economic security.\\\\n    So just real simply, do you believe that the ability of a \\\\nnation to feed itself is inherently more secure than a nation \\\\nthat relies on imports to feed its citizens.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I do.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Good. Thank you.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I am not an expert in that area, but I \\\\nbelieve in the H-2A visa process. And in fact, we are expanding \\\\nit throughout the hemisphere as a critical, lawful pathway.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Let me ask you a little bit about that. \\\\nEarlier this year, the USCIS finalized a new rule that would \\\\nincrease the cost to employers utilizing H-2A, among other \\\\nprograms. While I understand the purpose and the utility of a \\\\nfee-based program, the need to update based on increased costs, \\\\nthe rule as finalized is overly burdensome and costly to our \\\\nnation&#x27;s producers. Not only did the general filing fee \\\\nincrease, but a $600 asylum program fee was added, requiring ag \\\\nemployers to pay for a program that they really don&#x27;t receive \\\\nany benefit from.\\\\n    Additionally, instead of filling only one form for all of \\\\ntheir workers, the final rule caps the number of employees that \\\\ncan be listed on each form at 25. There is no added benefit \\\\nthat I can see for this policy, and it only increases paperwork \\\\nburdens and costs to ag employers.\\\\n    So now that the rule has gone into effect, as of last week, \\\\nwe have some actual costs associated with this rule. And they \\\\nfar exceed the predicted, indicated 20 percent--26 percent \\\\nincrease that was anticipated.\\\\n    So a couple questions here. Do you expect producers to \\\\nabsorb this cost, or are they to pass them on to consumers?\\\\n    If producers are expected to absorb these costs, how do you \\\\nexpect them to stay in business?\\\\n    And if they are no longer in business, how do you and the \\\\nadministration plan to protect our food security at the time \\\\nthat the majority of our foods served on our tables becomes \\\\nimported from other countries.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, two points. Number 1, I \\\\nwill allow experts to speak to the downstream economic \\\\nimplications of the fee rule that we were compelled to issue. I \\\\nam very sensitive to the fact that additional costs were \\\\nimposed on applicants, and I understand the burden that that \\\\nposes. But USCIS was really with its back against the wall, \\\\nhaving been driven almost to bankruptcy by the prior \\\\nadministration.\\\\n    The legislation provides that the agency charges are to be \\\\nrecalibrated according to costs. I believe it is every 2 years. \\\\nAnd a fee rule had not been promulgated successfully for over \\\\n7. I believe my time frames are correct. And so we had to make \\\\nsome very difficult decisions with respect to how to bring the \\\\nagency to a point of financial stability, which it had been \\\\nsuffering financial instability for too long, which created \\\\nbacklogs in the administration of our legal immigration system.\\\\n    I will follow up with experts to address your more \\\\neconomic-centered questions.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate that. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Newhouse.\\\\n    My understanding is our ranking member, Henry Cuellar, \\\\nwould like to ask you one more question.\\\\n\\\\n                           EXPEDITED REMOVAL\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. I just want to add, when I said CBP, I meant \\\\nDHS custody, would mean CBP and, of course, ICE. And I would \\\\nask you to please look at title 8, expedited removal, when they \\\\nare under custody under DHS, whether that includes being \\\\ndetained, whether that includes monitoring, or even a system \\\\nthat allows them to check in. That is still custody.\\\\n    I am just trying to see if we can do something where we can \\\\nadd funding for asylum officers, et cetera, et cetera, to have \\\\nyou do more title 8 expedited--for the ones that don&#x27;t qualify \\\\nfor asylum. So I would ask you to look into that.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. And we most certainly will and have, \\\\nRanking Member Cuellar. And I know that this is an area of \\\\nextensive litigation. But we will follow up so I can be more \\\\nresponsive to you.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n\\\\n                         EMPLOYEE INVESTIGATION\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. You are welcome, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    And I would be remiss, since we are talking about finances \\\\nhere, since I thought this question come up but without \\\\naddressing it directly with you, Mr. Secretary.\\\\n    After the horrific terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, \\\\nthe deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, \\\\none of your employees was exposed celebrating the attack \\\\nonline. It was later revealed that she previously worked for \\\\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization, or what is commonly \\\\nknown as the PLO, which has a very troublesome reputation, you \\\\nwill agree. According to a public comment she made on LinkedIn \\\\nas of 2 months ago, she was still getting paid by the \\\\nDepartment.\\\\n    Could you please set the record straight? Is this person \\\\nstill being paid by the Department of Homeland Security? And is \\\\nthe status of the investigation--what is the status of the \\\\ninvestigation into her behavior?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Mr. Chairman, the individual is on \\\\nadministrative leave, not performing the duties and \\\\nresponsibilities for which she was hired. The investigation is \\\\nongoing. And I cannot speak any further about it because it is \\\\nan ongoing personnel matter.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Can you give us a specific date on when this \\\\nverdict is going to be reached as to her employment?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I am not in control of the \\\\ninvestigation. But certainly I will provide you with whatever \\\\ndetails I am permitted to do.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. So as I understand you correctly, she is still \\\\non administrative leave and still being paid. Tell me, how many \\\\ntotal employees at the Department are under investigation for \\\\nsimilar purposes after the terrorist attack on Israel after \\\\nOctober 7?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. I personally am not aware of any other \\\\ninvestigations. But to provide you with accurate information, I \\\\nwill follow up.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. And have any changes been made to make sure that \\\\npeople of such character are not to be employed in your agency \\\\nfrom here on out?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. Individuals who are hired go through a \\\\nclearance process in DHS, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. I take it you will be tidying up those clearance \\\\nprocesses?\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas. We review our hiring and retention \\\\nprocesses on an ongoing basis. As a matter of fact, I am \\\\nmeeting with leadership this Friday to address one aspect of \\\\nthem.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Well, for the--first off, thank you to the \\\\nmembers who are here today.\\\\n    I would like to get back to the members who have submitted \\\\nquestions of which you said you would go back and scrutinize \\\\nyour records and report back to them. And if you could do so \\\\nwithin the next 15 business days, we would be most \\\\nappreciative. There may be some additional questions that \\\\nmembers may come up with or provide in writing. We ask you to \\\\nagain provide those answers on a timely basis.\\\\n    I would like to thank you for being here today, sir.\\\\n    And the subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank you.\\\\n    [Questions and answers submitted for the record follow:]\\\\n   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n                                          Thursday, April 11, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n                              MEMBERS&#x27; DAY\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Open our Member hearing today.\\\\n    Thank you very much for being here today. Now that we have \\\\ncome to order for this hearing, we will hear from the Members \\\\nabout a variety of topics that fall within our jurisdiction.\\\\n    Thank you to each of our colleagues for taking time out of \\\\nyour busy schedules to come here and discuss the projects and \\\\nprograms in the Homeland Security bill that are important to \\\\nyour districts and your communities.\\\\n    Your input is very important, I look forward to working \\\\nwith you and my fantastic Ranking Member Cuellar, and the \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee to pass a bill.\\\\n    Now, I turn to my colleague Mr. Cuellar, for any opening \\\\nstatement he may have.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you Mr. Chairman, and for holding this \\\\nmeeting.\\\\n    I am grateful that we are hearing testimony from our fellow \\\\nMembers of Congress, as we have done in the past, so our \\\\ncolleagues can highlight their areas of importance for the \\\\nAmerican people.\\\\n    As we had that opportunity yesterday to hear from the \\\\nSecretary about his priorities for the Department, I look \\\\nforward to hearing more from our colleagues and discussing \\\\ntheir priorities within Homeland Security.\\\\n    I am from the border, but I think we all know that Homeland \\\\ntouches every single congressional district from the border. So \\\\nthe chairman and I are looking forward to hearing from all of \\\\nyou. And thank you for being here with us.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    And with that, we will start with Representative Moylan.\\\\n                              ----------                              \\\\n\\\\n                                          Thursday, April 11, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JAMES C. MOYLAN, A DELEGATE IN CONGRESS FROM THE \\\\n    TERRITORY OF GUAM\\\\n    Mr. Moylan. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding \\\\nthis hearing and for all the work that you do. And I have come \\\\nhere today because I am concerned about the state of Guam&#x27;s \\\\nhomeland security.\\\\n    This isn&#x27;t because of the lack of determination in \\\\npersonnel or lack of leadership, but rather the lack of will, \\\\nfrom the administration, to properly fund Guam&#x27;s security \\\\nassets.\\\\n    As rogue actors continue to threaten the peace in the Indo-\\\\nPacific, Guam&#x27;s defense capabilities have been catapulted into \\\\nthe national limelight.\\\\n    Despite the attention, money has exclusively flowed toward \\\\nthe Department of Defense and has disregarded security agencies \\\\nin Guam. Local agencies like Guam&#x27;s Homeland Security Agency--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Sir, could you hold up for a moment?\\\\n    The gentleman outside who is recording wants to make sure \\\\nyou get all of your remarks.\\\\n    Mr. Moylan. OK. It is always red, so we are going to switch \\\\nto the green. All right. OK. What would you like me to do? \\\\nStart from this beginning or what&#x27;s better?\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. It is probably best.\\\\n    Mr. Moylan. OK. So I thank you for holding the hearing, Mr. \\\\nChairman, and for all the work that you do. I come here today \\\\nbecause I am concerned about the state of Guam&#x27;s homeland \\\\nsecurity.\\\\n    This isn&#x27;t because of the lack of determination and \\\\npersonnel or lack of leadership, but rather, a lack of will, \\\\nfrom the administration, to properly fund Guam&#x27;s security \\\\nassets.\\\\n    As rogue actors continue to threaten the peace in the Indo-\\\\nPacific, Guam&#x27;s defense capabilities have been catapulted into \\\\nthe national limelight, and despite this attention, money has \\\\nexclusively flowed toward the Department of Defense and has \\\\ndisregarded the security agencies in Guam.\\\\n    Our local agencies, like the Guam Homeland Security Agency, \\\\nGuam Customs and Quarantine, and the Guam Police Department, \\\\namong others, while filled with dedicated and hardworking \\\\nindividuals, have been seriously limited in their capabilities \\\\ndue to underfunding.\\\\n    Guam&#x27;s funding problems are multifaceted, extending across \\\\nmaritime, homeland, and cyber fields. It is time they receive \\\\nthe funding they need and deserve.\\\\n    We have Captain Simmons, the Commander of the U.S. Coast \\\\nGuard Forces Micronesia Sector Guam. He stated that the Guam \\\\nmaritime search and rescue region is, I quote, ``two thirds the \\\\nsize of the continental United States that we patrol with three \\\\nships and 300 people.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    So, to be clear, three fast response cutters are just not \\\\nenough. The size and the location of Guam&#x27;s area of \\\\nresponsibilities demand more of than just any three vessels can \\\\nprovide.\\\\n    Fast response cutters missions range from search and rescue \\\\nto coastal defense and the growing threat of illegal fishing. \\\\nWhile three fast response cutters will be enough for Guam&#x27;s \\\\ncoast, the addition of freely associated states greatly expands \\\\nthe area of responsibility and pushes the limits of what these \\\\nfast response cutters can accomplish.\\\\n    As we discussed homeland security and the growing threat of \\\\ntransnational criminals and the state actors in the region, I \\\\nrespectfully request expanded funding for more Coast Guard \\\\nvessels in sector Guam.\\\\n    On transnational threats, a common misconception is that \\\\nillegal immigration does not exist on Guam because it only has \\\\nwater borders. That simply is not true. Guam&#x27;s borders are \\\\nconsistently abused and underfunded and is felt throughout the \\\\nentire region.\\\\n    This abuse can take many forms, whether marriage fraud, \\\\noutright sneaking onto the island, or the rare Visa overstays. \\\\nThe only way to solve this blatant security risk is to \\\\ndrastically increase appropriations for Guam&#x27;s Customs and \\\\nBorder Patrol capabilities.\\\\n    Guam&#x27;s Customs and Quarantine agencies, the CBP equivalent \\\\nin Guam, desperately needs funding. For the sake of Guam and \\\\nthe CONUS&#x27;s security, an increase in funding directly towards \\\\nour customs and quarantine agencies is critical.\\\\n    They need the additional training, the resources, and the \\\\nsupport as they are not just protecting Guam&#x27;s waters, but the \\\\nNations.\\\\n    On their behalf, I ask for the Committee&#x27;s support. As Guam \\\\ncontinues to rebuild from Typhoon Mayar, FEMA assistance is \\\\nstill needed. As the insurer of all Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity grants, FEMA has a critical role in rebuilding Guam \\\\nand securing a more resilient future.\\\\n    Our island agencies rely heavily on the grants from \\\\ncapability upgrades but are hindered due to their competitive \\\\nnature. If we look at the current structure of the Homeland \\\\nSecurity Grant Program, the emphasis is on traditional \\\\ncounterterrorism risk has been detrimental.\\\\n    Simultaneously, this grant program disregards the growing \\\\nneed for threats coming from transnational organized crime and \\\\ncyberattacks. So while HSGP and other FEMA grants are outdated, \\\\nincreasing funding for these programs would fill capabilities \\\\non Guam that they otherwise cannot afford.\\\\n    For all the discussion about Guam&#x27;s defense readiness and \\\\nwhat the U.S. needs to prepare for the Pacific, it is \\\\ndisheartening that Guam gets the bare minimum of the FEMA grant \\\\nmoney pool. This doesn&#x27;t just impact my district, but also our \\\\nNation.\\\\n    It is known that the People&#x27;s Republic of China is always \\\\nlooking for ways to infiltrate and disrupt U.S. cyber \\\\ncomponents. While interagency cyber efforts have been created, \\\\nGuam&#x27;s cyber capabilities are still ignored.\\\\n    The most disturbing part of Guam&#x27;s cyber gap is the \\\\nunderfunded staff. For all the cyberattacks Guam faces, it is \\\\ninsanity that the Cyber Infrastructure Security Agency has \\\\ndesignated only two employees for the entire island.\\\\n    If CISA cannot afford to distribute cybersecurity personnel \\\\nto a high valued area like Guam, they need greater funding from \\\\nthe Subcommittee.\\\\n    I understand that many states need cyber improvements, but \\\\nif the PRC is confident enough to attack Guam&#x27;s infrastructure \\\\nduring an extreme weather event, they will only continue to \\\\nbatter us.\\\\n    Guam has been called the tip of the spear for defense \\\\npurposes, and for good reason. While the DoD and National \\\\nDefense Authorization Act have excelled in fortifying Guam&#x27;s \\\\nouter security ring, the homeland security inner ring still has \\\\na long way to go.\\\\n    Despite being essential to the U.S. nationalist strategy, \\\\nGuam&#x27;s homeland security needs have largely been ignored. Mr. \\\\nChairman, I beg you to consider an increase in funding for DHS \\\\nand its constituent agencies in Guam.\\\\n    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you and I yield back.\\\\n    [The prepared statement follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you for your message, and at this point, \\\\nwe will recognize Representative Manning for her statement.\\\\n                              ----------                              \\\\n\\\\n                                          Thursday, April 11, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. KATHY E. MANNING, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM \\\\n    THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Thank you so much, Chairman Joyce, Ranking \\\\nMember Cuellar, and members of the subcommittee, I am deeply \\\\ngrateful for your leadership on this committee, and I \\\\nappreciate the opportunity to testify before you today.\\\\n    I am here as the proud co-chair of the House Bipartisan \\\\nTask Force for Combating Antisemitism, which I chair together \\\\nwith Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey and six other co-\\\\nchairs on both sides of the aisle, including House \\\\nAppropriations Committee Chairwoman Kay Granger and Vice \\\\nRanking Member Grace Meng.\\\\n    I would like to urge the members of the subcommittee to \\\\ncontinue your strong record of bonds bipartisan support by \\\\nincreasing funding for the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s \\\\nNonprofit Security Grant Program in fiscal year 2025.\\\\n    As you know, in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terrorist \\\\nattack against Israel, we have seen a dramatic increase of \\\\nantisemitic hatred, a heightened threat environment for the \\\\nJewish institutions and places of worship in the United States.\\\\n    The Anti-Defamation League has recorded a 360 percent \\\\nincrease in antisemitic incidents in the United States in the \\\\nthree months since October 7th. The Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity&#x27;s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, the NSGP, is the \\\\nsingle most effective resource for the Jewish community to \\\\nprotect its institutions and our communities from harm.\\\\n    Synagogues, Jewish community centers, Jewish schools, and \\\\nmany other faith based and nonprofit institutions rely on this \\\\ncritical funding to keep them safe.\\\\n    According to the Department of Homeland Security, the NSGP \\\\nenables DHS to support facility hardening and other operational \\\\nand physical security enhancements for nonprofit organizations \\\\nthat may be at risk of attack.\\\\n    DHS also continues to refine the grant processes to \\\\nstreamline the NSGP application process through enhanced \\\\ntraining, new methods of technical assistance, and engagements \\\\nwith rural and underserved communities to ensure they are aware \\\\nof the purpose and requirements of this grant program.\\\\n    This critical program has directly benefited communities in \\\\nour congressional districts across the country.\\\\n    Given the dramatic rise in antisemitism in recent months, \\\\nit was deeply disappointing that the vital funding in this \\\\nprogram was cut by $30.5 million in the final FY 2024 \\\\nnegotiated bill for Congress passed last month.\\\\n    Instead of being increased, this 10 percent cut from the \\\\nprevious year&#x27;s enacted level comes as the security needs of \\\\nour communities outstrip demands.\\\\n    As Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas testified to \\\\nCongress in November, the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is \\\\ntremendously oversubscribed. The demand for these funds from \\\\nlarge and small institutions of all faiths far exceeds the \\\\namount of funding that we have.\\\\n    I believe we should pair increasing funding for the NSGP \\\\nwith other enhancements to improve efficiency. That is why the \\\\nCountering Antisemitism Act, a new bipartisan bicameral \\\\nlegislation I introduced this week, would require the FEMA \\\\nAdministrator to ensure that the agency has sufficient \\\\nresources and personnel needed to carry out the Nonprofit \\\\nSecurity Grant Program.\\\\n    I also want to reject a recent despicable effort, by some \\\\nextreme far left groups, that falsely claim to speak for the \\\\nJewish community to undermine the longstanding bipartisan \\\\nsupport for this critical programming, claiming that it \\\\nprovides an insidious cover for the systemic violence caused by \\\\nthe Department of Homeland Security.\\\\n    Nothing could be further from the truth. This security \\\\nfocused, competitive grant program helps protect Americans of \\\\nevery religion and background from threats.\\\\n    We must not let fringe, far left groups like these endanger \\\\nthe safety and security of our Jewish day schools, synagogues, \\\\nand other institutions. That is why we desperately need your \\\\nhelp.\\\\n    I respectfully request that in the upcoming fiscal year, \\\\nthe Subcommittee approved funding of $500 million for the \\\\nNonprofit Security Grant Program. We must urgently pass the \\\\nbipartisan Senate-passed National Security Supplemental, which \\\\nincluded $400 million in emergency funding for the NSGP.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, thank you for your work on \\\\nthis committee throughout your time in Congress and your help \\\\nto fight the scourge of antisemitism.\\\\n    I am grateful for your time today. I look forward to \\\\nworking together with you and members of both parties to better \\\\nprotect the Jewish community and counter antisemitism and hate.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And I know \\\\nhow important those are and certainly used them in our \\\\ncommunity as well.\\\\n    Representative Van Drew is next. You might want to check by \\\\npushing that farther in into the back.\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. Yeah, you know, right. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. The cord in the back of that looks like it might \\\\nbe out a little, too.\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. I appreciate you. She is smart. I know you \\\\nare smart because you are the only microphone that works so \\\\nfar.\\\\n    [The prepared statement follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n                                          Thursday, April 11, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM \\\\n    THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you for your \\\\ngood work. Thank you for allowing me to speak today.\\\\n    I am here to request your Subcommittee to fund investments \\\\nat the United States Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May \\\\nfor the fiscal year 2025. It is in the Homeland Security \\\\nAppropriations Act.\\\\n    The Training Center Cape May is the beating heart of the \\\\nCoast Guard community. Every year, thousands of Coast Guard \\\\nrecruits come to Cape May and prepare to serve our country.\\\\n    It is the Coast Guard Training Center for the United States \\\\nof America. It trains well over 80 percent of all enlisted \\\\nrecruits from around the country. The Training Center was \\\\nestablished 70 years ago, and it really, truly needs to be \\\\nmodernized.\\\\n    Deficiencies range from insufficient housing space that \\\\nlimits the number of potential recruits to hazardous outdoor \\\\ntraining conditions. You know, New Jersey is not always kind in \\\\nthe wintertime, and they have to train outside, and it is \\\\nactually not appropriate at the times that they have to. In \\\\nsleet, snow, driving rain, Nor&#x27;easter coming off the ocean \\\\nbecause they are right on the ocean.\\\\n    It is time for the Coast Guard to develop a world-class \\\\ntraining facility that promotes recruitment and retention. It \\\\nis impossible to accomplish this mission without financial \\\\nresources from this Congress.\\\\n    The Coast Guard has identified two projects for Cape May in \\\\nits fiscal year 2025 budget request. Both are included on the \\\\nunfunded priorities lists, housing, family support, safety, and \\\\ntraining facilities category in addendum one.\\\\n    The first request is for $15 million to survey and design a \\\\nstate-of-the-art indoor training facility. It is about time. \\\\nThis facility will enable year-round physical training, improve \\\\nrecruit readiness, and enhance retention, which is an issue.\\\\n    The second request is for $60 million to recapitalize the \\\\nsecond stage of three recruit training barracks. It is \\\\nimportant. This project will increase the number of potential \\\\nrecruits and, importantly, very importantly, allow for more \\\\nappropriate accommodations for our female recruits.\\\\n    This committee funded the first barracks project three \\\\nyears ago, which is well into its design phase and is being \\\\nprepared for construction. The House Transportation Committee \\\\nsupports all of these projects, and it has informed me of the \\\\nneed for $15 million upward revision for the first barracks. \\\\nAnd it is due to cost increases due to inflation.\\\\n    This means that, all in all, I am requesting approximately \\\\n$90 million to be appropriated throughout the fiscal year 2025 \\\\nHomeland Security bill for improvements at the Training Center, \\\\nCape May.\\\\n    It is a huge priority for me, but most importantly, it is a \\\\nhuge priority for the United States Coast Guard and for the \\\\nUnited States of America.\\\\n    I welcome any questions, and I hope that we may, together, \\\\nfund these items in 2025 fiscal year. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you so much for your comments.\\\\n    And like the wedding feast of Canaan, will we save the best \\\\nfor last, maybe?\\\\n    [The prepared statement follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n                                          Thursday, April 11, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. GREG STANTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE \\\\n    STATE OF ARIZONA\\\\n    Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Chairman Joyce and \\\\nRanking Member Cuellar. It is an honor to be here for one of \\\\nyour last meetings as chair of this subcommittee.\\\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on issues \\\\ncritically important to my home State of Arizona. Arizona is on \\\\nthe front lines of the border crisis like Texas.\\\\n    In just the first 4 months of this fiscal year, Border \\\\nPatrol in the Tucson sector apprehended more than 250,000 \\\\nmigrants, the highest number on record.\\\\n    Earlier this year, I was at the border in Nogales, AZ, to \\\\nspeak with Customs and Border Patrol leadership, staff from \\\\nmigrant service providers and business and trade leaders from \\\\nArizona and Sonora, Mexico.\\\\n    I spoke with the Customs and Border Protection agents at \\\\nthe Mariposa Port of Entry and with Border Patrol in the field. \\\\nTo quote the CBP&#x27;s Director of Field Operations for the Tucson \\\\nsector, their number one ask is for more resources, more \\\\nmanpower, and of course, better technology.\\\\n    So I appear before you today to lift up that request, and I \\\\nknow you support it as well. More resources, more manpower, and \\\\nbetter technology for our border.\\\\n    We took important steps in FY 2024 funding with your \\\\nleadership funding for 22,000 border patrol agents, almost $76 \\\\nmillion to acquire additional non-intrusive inspection \\\\ndetection systems, $20 million for an additional 150 CBP \\\\nofficers to support counter fentanyl efforts and $650 million \\\\nfor the Shelter and Services Program.\\\\n    This subcommittee understands that we do need more staff at \\\\nthe border. It is why FY 2024 funding included the funds to \\\\nraise the number of Border Patrol agents to 22,000. But we must \\\\nalso be ensure that we can recruit and retain qualified \\\\nofficers.\\\\n    On average, it takes 400 days for CBP to hire personnel. \\\\nThat&#x27;s why I introduced bipartisan legislation with my \\\\ncolleague from Arizona, Representative Juan Ciscomani, to \\\\nimprove CBP&#x27;s flexibility in hiring, recruiting, and retaining \\\\nagents, officers, and employees, specifically in rural and \\\\nremote areas.\\\\n    When we don&#x27;t have sufficient personnel, it is communities \\\\nlike mine that suffer. In December of last year, the Lukeville \\\\nPort of Entry was closed for a month as DHS redirected all CBP \\\\nstaff to assist in processing an unprecedented surge of migrant \\\\narrivals.\\\\n    The closure of the port negatively impacted economies of \\\\nboth Arizona and Mexico during one of the busiest months for \\\\ncross border commerce and tourism.\\\\n    The economic impact of keeping our ports of entry open is \\\\nundeniable. Last year alone, CBP processed $32 trillion in \\\\ntrade and collected $90 billion for the U.S. government. And in \\\\nArizona, Mexican visitors spend over $11 million per day. We \\\\nmust also continue to deploy cutting edge technology at our \\\\nborder to disrupt the flow of fentanyl. Deaths related to the \\\\nuse of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have risen \\\\nby nearly 200 percent in the past decade, and much of the \\\\nfentanyl is being made by cartels just across the border.\\\\n    We should continue to purchase more non-intrusive \\\\ninspection detection systems, provide the funding needed to \\\\ninstall the systems, and hire additional personnel to support \\\\ncounter fentanyl efforts.\\\\n    And Arizona is a national model for responding to the \\\\nmigrant surges. But the allocation of Shelter and Service \\\\nProgram dollars to Arizona has been disproportionate. Last \\\\nyear, the Southern Arizona Coalition, group of cities, \\\\ncounties, and NGOs was only eligible to apply for $12 million \\\\nin assistance through the SSP, while New York received nearly \\\\nnine times that amount.\\\\n    Without SSP dollars, local governments and NGOs simply \\\\ncannot continue to fund their response, leaving no other option \\\\nthan chaotic street releases in cities and towns along the US-\\\\nMexico border.\\\\n    Not only does SSP funding to border communities limit the \\\\nchaos in communities along the southern border, but it also \\\\nreduces the impact to interior cities and states. Organizations \\\\nlike Tucson&#x27;s Casa Alitas provide essential services that help \\\\nasylum seekers find sponsors so that migrants arrive in the \\\\ninterior cities with a travel plan and a place to stay as they \\\\nawait adjudication of the cases, relieving the burden on city \\\\nservices.\\\\n    I urge the subcommittee to provide a robust SSP funding in \\\\nFY 2025 that prioritizes border communities. I can&#x27;t underscore \\\\nenough how critical funding is to border states, and I urge the \\\\nsubcommittee to invest the resources, manpower, and technology \\\\nthat border communities rely on.\\\\n    Arizonans face the realities of a broken immigration system \\\\nevery day. As do all states across the country. We must ensure \\\\nthat the federal government provides the funding needed to ease \\\\nthis burden and keep our community safe.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify in front of \\\\nthis important committee, and I look forward to partnering with \\\\nyou to keep our border safe and secure. Thank you.\\\\n    [The prepared statement follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you. And I had the opportunity last year \\\\nto go down with Representative Ciscomani, do a full tour of the \\\\narea and I understand completely where you are coming from. We \\\\njust wish we had more money----\\\\n    Mr. Stanton. All right.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce [continuing]. In order to accommodate those type \\\\nof things. Anything from Mr. Cuellar?\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. A lot of good ideas. Appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you all for being here today. It is certainly \\\\nappreciating for your colleagues on how best to do this. I \\\\nthink it is part of the system that gets--people give the idea \\\\nof what they call member directive resources or earmarks of bad \\\\nname.\\\\n    Who better than your local representative working in \\\\nconcert with your State and local officials to discern where \\\\nthis money could best be spent? So I appreciate the input on \\\\nit, and good luck.\\\\n    Mr. Stanton. Voice of reason.\\\\n    Mr. Moylan. Yeah.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Van Drew. By the way, you are all welcome to come down \\\\nto Cape May in the summer. It is spectacular.\\\\n    Mr. Joyce.

The subcommittee will come to order.\\\\n    The subject of today&#x27;s hearing is the fiscal year 2025 \\\\nbudget request for FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management \\\\nAgency.\\\\n    I know for those of you committee veterans, which is \\\\neverybody but me, it is traditional to give an opening \\\\nstatement at this point in time and as the newest member of the \\\\ncommittee, I am sure that nobody is looking forward to what I \\\\nmight make up for an opening statement.\\\\n    So we are going to skip that.\\\\n    And with that, I would recognize our ranking member, Mr. \\\\nCuellar, for your opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I congratulate you on \\\\nthe new role as chairman of this subcommittee and welcome and \\\\nlook forward to working with you in a bipartisan way.\\\\n    I do, I am of tradition. So I will have my opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Again, Administrator Criswell, it is nice to have you here. \\\\nAnd I think this year we celebrate 45 years of FEMA working \\\\nwith folks and of course helping them with their disasters \\\\nbefore, during, and after.\\\\n    We want to thank you and the thousands of the FEMA staff \\\\nfor their dedication, the commitment for serving our country \\\\nwhen we need it. We were just talking about hurricane season. \\\\nAnd again, your job doesn&#x27;t get any easier every year, but \\\\nagain, you all have been working in a tremendous way.\\\\n    This year we know that there is a lot of work to be done. \\\\nFunding has become tighter, fewer resources. But again, we want \\\\nto work with you. And we certainly are happy that we are able \\\\nto include the new authority in the recently enacted 2024 \\\\nfunding that allows the entire department to access an Employee \\\\nEmergency Backup Care Program.\\\\n    And again, working with the Office of Health Security, we \\\\ncertainly want to make sure we work on workforce wellness and \\\\ntelemedicine Health and Employee Assistance Pilot Program.\\\\n    We also want to talk about learning a little bit more about \\\\nstaffing challenges. I think Homeland is one of those agencies \\\\nthat were heavy on personnel, not on capital, but on employees.\\\\n    So we certainly want to work with you on that. We also want \\\\nto make sure that we talk a little bit about the $650 million \\\\nthat went off to the Food and Shelter Service Program.\\\\n    As you know, this is a program that I started some years \\\\nago. It was a border-based type of funding. But over the years, \\\\nwe know what has happened in New York and other places, but \\\\ncertainly I have a few questions on that. Certainly want to \\\\ntalk to you about Stonegarden operations. Stonegarden, that is \\\\nso important for our law enforcement folks to work with \\\\nHomeland. But with that, I will try to say thank you \\\\nAdministrator, and look forward to hearing from your testimony \\\\nand asking questions. Thank you so much.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you to the gentleman from the Lone Star \\\\nstate. I would like to thank you for being here, Madam \\\\nCriswell, and we will recognize you now for a summary of your \\\\nwritten testimony which will be included in our record.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Thank you chairman Amodei and Ranking Member \\\\nCuellar and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to discuss the President&#x27;s $33.1 billion budget \\\\nrequest for FEMA for fiscal year 2025.\\\\n    Emergency management has changed in recent years, and \\\\nemergency managers across the country are being asked to do \\\\nmore. FEMA is no exception, and to support communities across \\\\nthe nation, FEMA must have commensurate funding.\\\\n    Whether it is a wildfire, a flood, a derecho storm, or \\\\nother disaster, it is vital that FEMA be able to tap into an \\\\nadequately funded disaster relief fund.\\\\n    FEMA&#x27;s total request includes $22.7 billion for the DRF to \\\\nrespond to new and ongoing disasters. This is a $2 billion \\\\nincrease over fiscal year 2024 funding levels to support \\\\ncontinued recovery efforts such as those in Maui after the most \\\\ndevastating wildfires in the island&#x27;s history.\\\\n    At the DRF&#x27;s present funding levels, FEMA may need to \\\\nresort to immediate needs funding before the end of this \\\\ncurrent fiscal year so as to preserve remaining DRF balances \\\\nfor life and safety, response operations, and other critical \\\\nsurvivor needs.\\\\n    To mitigate INF risks, I urge the committee to act on the \\\\ndisaster supplemental request for fiscal year 2024, which \\\\nrequested an additional $9 billion for the DRF.\\\\n    FEMA requires not only a fully funded DRF, but also a well-\\\\ntrained workforce ready to deploy at a moment&#x27;s notice. The \\\\nfiscal year 2025 budget provides $2.4 billion in personnel pay, \\\\ncompensation, and benefits. Because workforce well-being, \\\\nrecruitment, and retention are critical.\\\\n    One of my priorities for this year is continuing to boost \\\\nthe capacity of state, local, tribal, and territorial partners \\\\nto respond to extreme weather events. There is no longer a \\\\ndisaster season.\\\\n    Natural disasters occur throughout the entire year, often \\\\nconcurrently and in places that are not accustomed to them. I \\\\ntalk to state directors regularly and in nearly every \\\\nconversation they ask for help improving their capacity to \\\\naddress this year-round disaster response tempo.\\\\n    And as FEMA continues to adapt to the rapidly intensifying \\\\ndisaster cadence, one thing is clear, FEMA is more than just a \\\\nresponse and a recovery agency. FEMA helps communities become \\\\nmore resilient and better prepared before a disaster strikes.\\\\n    One way FEMA achieves this goal is through grant programs. \\\\nGrants aid our SLTT governments and the private sector to help \\\\nbuild operational capabilities needed to implement preparedness \\\\nstrategies and reduce or eliminate long term risks to people \\\\nand property.\\\\n    FEMA&#x27;s fiscal year 2025 budget request includes $3.2 \\\\nbillion for grants to help safeguard our communities, our \\\\ncitizens, and support our nation&#x27;s first responders.\\\\n    For example, FEMA&#x27;s budget request includes an increase of \\\\n$25 million each for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant and \\\\nthe Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response programs, \\\\nbetter known as the AFG and SAFER programs.\\\\n    An increase to these programs will enable FEMA to provide \\\\nadditional financial assistance directly to eligible fire \\\\ndepartments, non-affiliated medical service organizations, and \\\\nstate fire training academies.\\\\n    Another critical tool is the Nonprofit Security Grant \\\\nProgram, which provides funds for physical security \\\\nenhancements and other security related activities for \\\\nnonprofit organizations at a high risk of terrorist attack.\\\\n    FEMA&#x27;s fiscal year 2025 budget requests $385 million, an \\\\nincrease of $110 million above the enacted level for fiscal \\\\nyear 2024 for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to expand \\\\nthe program to more nonprofit organizations in both high-risk \\\\nurban and rural areas.\\\\n    The budget request also includes $1 billion for the \\\\nBuilding Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Grant \\\\nProgram. These grants support SLTT mitigation projects, which \\\\nreduce risks posed by disasters and natural hazards.\\\\n    We also recognize that, on average, disaster related floods \\\\nlead to more deaths every year than any other natural event. \\\\nFEMA is requesting $364 million for flood hazard mapping and \\\\nrisk analysis, an increase of $51 million.\\\\n    This will help modernize FEMA mapping and assist \\\\ncommunities as they prepare for future flooding conditions.\\\\n    Constituents in your districts and neighborhoods across the \\\\nnation rely on FEMA more than ever before, and our fiscal year \\\\n2025 budget request provides the necessary resources to meet \\\\nour mission of helping people before, during, and after \\\\ndisasters.\\\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look \\\\nforward to your questions.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Madam Administrator.\\\\n    Now, we will go to our ranking member.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar, the floor is yours for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Mr. Chairman, thank you.\\\\n    Can I ask you about the Food and Shelter Program? As I \\\\nmentioned, this is a program that, when our former chair, Kay \\\\nGranger and myself were in Laredo, we saw the needs for this so \\\\nwe established this, I think 2013 or 2014, but it was supposed \\\\nto go with funding from the State government.\\\\n    Our governors didn&#x27;t want to do this soft type of work \\\\nusing these Federal dollars. So I think it was in 2017, we \\\\nchanged the delivery mechanism, put the original $30 million, \\\\nand of course, it went to 100, 800, now, we are at 650.\\\\n    One of the things that I always look at is where does money \\\\ngo? Because it was originally for a border, because that is \\\\nwhere most of the--that is where the migrants come in.\\\\n    You all made an initial $275 million this last week to a 55 \\\\nrecipients. You know, I have a series of questions. One is, how \\\\ndo you make sure that, with the top line numbers, how do we \\\\nmake sure that they go to the right places?\\\\n    Because everybody is saying they ought to go to Chicago, \\\\nthey ought to go to New York. And of course, us at the border \\\\nwere saying, hey, this should be at the border. So that is one.\\\\n    I&#x27;d like to find out. What is the percentage that go to \\\\nborder communities as opposed to the interior? And then one of \\\\nthe things I noticed on the policy changes was when we started \\\\nthis program, my intent was it was supposed to be food, \\\\nshelter, medicine, not for transportation.\\\\n    Recently there has been transportation costs in my area. We \\\\ndon&#x27;t do that in Laredo, but they do it in San Antonio, as you \\\\nknow. And I saw that you all lifted the limits on available \\\\nfunding for travel, I guess for hotels or should I say shelter.\\\\n    And then you lifted the 45-day limitation, which means that \\\\nif somebody is supposed to be there for 45 days now, they can \\\\nbe there 60 days. It doesn&#x27;t affect the top numbers. But this \\\\nis not, quite honestly, it is not the way I envisioned this \\\\nprogram at the very beginning.\\\\n    So I would like to see your thoughts on this program.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    The SSP program, I think, as you clearly articulated, \\\\nstarted out as our Emergency Food and Shelter program for \\\\nhumanitarian.\\\\n    We took an existing program and as directed by Congress, \\\\ncreated a new program to support the humanitarian needs and \\\\nstarted out with a small amount of money as that money has \\\\nincreased, but also as entities have asked for additional \\\\nsupport to help cover some of the costs that they are \\\\nincurring.\\\\n    I think it was last year we enacted the first ever SSP \\\\nprogram, which is now designed to better address the impacts \\\\nthat communities are experiencing.\\\\n    As directed by Congress, transportation is one of those \\\\ncosts that is an acceptable reimbursable expense that \\\\njurisdictions are receiving. However, we do require----\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Sorry. I----\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Yes, no, absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. I apologize. I don&#x27;t mean to interrupt.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. That&#x27;s OK.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Transportation within a locality or \\\\ntransportation from one locality to another locality? In other \\\\nwords, San Antonio to New York City.\\\\n    At the beginning, I had looked at local transportation \\\\ninside a city. But you are referring to one location to another \\\\nlocation?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. That is an expense that we are reimbursing. I \\\\ndon&#x27;t believe the way the legislation reads it limits it to \\\\njust within the jurisdiction. But what we do require is that \\\\nthere is coordination between the sending jurisdiction and the \\\\nreceiving community.\\\\n    And so in order for transportation to be reimbursable, that \\\\nhas to be that level of coordination that happens.\\\\n    I also wanted to address, you know, the lifting of the cap. \\\\nIt was a cap that we put in place. It wasn&#x27;t directed by \\\\nCongress. And what we heard, as we continue to try to improve \\\\nthe delivery of this program, is that some entities, many of \\\\nour nonprofits, wanted greater flexibility in the types of \\\\nexpenses that they could submit for reimbursement.\\\\n    And so we adapted the program to meet their needs. But I \\\\nwant to be clear, and I think, as you clearly stated, \\\\nCongressman, is that there is no additional funding coming to \\\\nthis.\\\\n    There is still the limit of the amount of money we have. \\\\nAnd what I would say is that all of these jurisdictions are \\\\noversubscribed with how much they are incurring and how much we \\\\nare able to reimburse.\\\\n    What we attempted to do with this lifting of the cap is to \\\\ncreate greater flexibility for them in how they want to submit \\\\ntheir expenses for reimbursement.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. My time is up. So you are saying that if \\\\nsomebody is in a New York hotel, instead of being there 45 \\\\ndays, they can be paid for 60 days? One.\\\\n    And then if you don&#x27;t have the answer now, if you all can \\\\nsubmit it, how much money on this first tranche, including last \\\\nyear&#x27;s money, went to border communities and then interior \\\\ncommittees?\\\\n    And my time is up, but if you all want to submit that.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Yeah, I don&#x27;t have the exact percentages, \\\\nCongressman, but we&#x27;ll be happy to get that to you and, you \\\\nknow, just to add, we&#x27;re also moving into a competitive program \\\\nfor SSP, because we do understand that there is changing needs \\\\nand the intent has always been to create the SSP program as a \\\\ncompetitive program instead of a direct allocation so we can \\\\nget the most current impact that communities or nonprofit \\\\norganizations are experiencing.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Mr. Newhouse, the floor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member \\\\nCuellar, and Administrator Criswell. Thanks for being here with \\\\nus. And let me say, welcome to the committee, Mr. Chairman. \\\\nLook forward to your leadership.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you for helping me find which room it was \\\\nin today. I appreciate that.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I want to focus at first on emergency \\\\ncommunications. In the strategic plan that dated 2022 to 2026, \\\\nnotes that FEMA must transform how the agency delivers support \\\\nso that partners can increase their capacity and their ability \\\\nto manage future events.\\\\n    A noble goal. A vital part of a community&#x27;s ability to \\\\nmanage future events is the ability for the state, and the \\\\nlocal, and the tribal public safety agencies to have reliable \\\\nand secure communications so they can coordinate during a \\\\nresponse effort.\\\\n    So while emergency communication technologies have advanced \\\\nfirst responders in many of the small and rural communities \\\\nlike I represent in central Washington state, for instance, \\\\nBenton County in the city of Richland, they are left on the \\\\nwrong channel because they can&#x27;t afford to upgrade their \\\\ncommunication systems.\\\\n    Congress has previously provided funding to improve \\\\ninteroperability between public safety agencies at all levels, \\\\nwhich included support for the purchase of fire and police and \\\\nradios, construction of towers, training, that kind of thing.\\\\n    One of these programs was the Public Safety Interoperable \\\\nCommunications Grant Program, which was led by FEMA, in \\\\ncollaboration with the National Telecommunications and \\\\nInformation Administration.\\\\n    My understanding that that program is no longer funded, \\\\nalthough the FY 2025 budget proposes creating a new full-time \\\\ndedicated policy and coordination office for FEMA to focus on \\\\nclimate adaptation and its impacts.\\\\n    So I would argue that ensuring public safety agencies, \\\\nespecially those in small and rural communities, which you are \\\\nfamiliar with in Colorado, their ability to reliably \\\\ncommunicate aligns with FEMA&#x27;s mission as well as the strategic \\\\nplan that I mentioned.\\\\n    So you mentioned that $3.2 billion requested for grant \\\\nfunding. How does this proposal specifically support emergency \\\\nmanagers and first responders in these small and rural \\\\ncommunities?\\\\n    Is there any support for public safety agencies to enhance \\\\ntheir communications interoperability?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Thank you, Congressman Newhouse. You know, we \\\\nhave a suite of grant programs that are designed to assist \\\\ncommunities build their capacity and communications.\\\\n    Having been a firefighter myself, I understand the \\\\nimportance of being able to have the interoperable \\\\ncommunications to be able to respond regionally to different \\\\nevents.\\\\n    The grant programs that we have through the Homeland \\\\nSecurity Grant program suite, whether it&#x27;s our UASI program or \\\\nthe Homeland Security Program, those are all eligible expenses \\\\nfor communities to utilize that funding to help increase the \\\\nlevel of capacity needed.\\\\n    I am not familiar with the grant program that you \\\\nmentioned. I would assume, as we were consolidating grants in \\\\nthe past in our Homeland Security suite, that it was included \\\\nas part of that as an eligible expense.\\\\n    I&#x27;m certainly happy to get back to you with more \\\\ninformation on that, but I think the key towards the end of \\\\nyour question is really how do we build this capacity for state \\\\nand local public safety workers to include our emergency \\\\nmanagers?\\\\n    And it is one of the things that I continue to see as the \\\\ngreatest challenge that we face as we continue to respond, \\\\nrecover, but also build resilience in these communities, is the \\\\nlack of capacity that we have.\\\\n    And so funding these grant programs, whether it&#x27;s the \\\\nHomeland Security Suite or our Emergency Management Performance \\\\nGrant Program, which is the only grant program designed just to \\\\nsupport our emergency managers.\\\\n    They&#x27;re really critical to make sure that they are funded \\\\nto continue to build that capacity and communications in all of \\\\nthose programs are acceptable items to submit for reimbursement \\\\nthrough those grant programs.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you. Thank you. I just have a short \\\\namount of time left, but I wanted to ask about the DRF, the \\\\nDisaster Relief Fund, in which multiple agencies share a \\\\nresponsibility regarding wildfire response, recovery efforts, \\\\nincluding awarding of contracts and overall management during \\\\nwildfire season, which looks like it is going to be another bad \\\\none.\\\\n    This may sound familiar because I think I asked something \\\\nsimilar last year. The Disaster Relief Fund is at risk of \\\\nexperiencing a shortfall in less than 6 months.\\\\n    So as we look forward to a long, hot, dry summer, how is \\\\nyour agency preparing to respond to these disasters? And what \\\\nis your communication like with state agencies so they can as \\\\nwell be prepared?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. As it relates to the Disaster Relief Fund, I \\\\nthink as I stated in my opening statement, we are anticipating \\\\na shortfall this year, somewhere perhaps in the August \\\\ntimeframe.\\\\n    As we continue to recoup and see what that looks like, we \\\\nwill implement what we did last year, which is Immediate Needs \\\\nFunding to make sure we always have enough funding available to \\\\nsupport lifesaving and life sustaining activities.\\\\n    The Immediate Needs Funding just delays recovery projects. \\\\nIt doesn&#x27;t halt them, it just delays them until, until the DRF \\\\nis replenished. But that then just contributes to a greater \\\\ndeficit going forward.\\\\n    We have these communications openly. I personally speak \\\\nwith all of our state directors so they understand the status \\\\nof our Disaster Relief Fund and what the impact might be on \\\\nthem and their recovery projects.\\\\n    But as it relates to being ready for this disaster season, \\\\noutside of the funding, we continue to work with our state and \\\\nlocals to understand where their gaps are and what we can \\\\ncontinue to do to help build their own readiness.\\\\n    As stated in my strategic plan, a ready FEMA in a prepared \\\\nnation. And that&#x27;s about building that capacity. As I talked \\\\nabout with the last question, building that capacity at the \\\\nstate and local level so they have the resources they need to \\\\nrespond to their jurisdictions if one of these severe weather \\\\nevents impacts them.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony.\\\\n    Thank you Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentlemen from Maryland, Dr. Harris, the \\\\nfloor is yours.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. Thank you very much. And thank you \\\\nAdministrator Criswell, for being here. And thanks for your \\\\nservice in the past.\\\\n    I am going to ask about the Shelter and Services Program, \\\\nwhich is administered by FEMA in partnership with CBP.\\\\n    So my first question is, is it funded through FEMA or \\\\nthrough CBP or through both or what?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. The funding is appropriated to CBP, and then \\\\nthey pass it through to FEMA.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. So the entire amount is passed through?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Yes.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. OK. So a little Federal shell game here. OK. \\\\nBecause it says in your statement that FEMA&#x27;s mission is to \\\\nhelp people before, during, and after disasters. So do you \\\\nconsider the southern border a disaster?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I am not an immigration expert, Congressman. \\\\nMy role in this is to administer the SSP Program as directed by \\\\nCongress to support jurisdictions that are experiencing costs \\\\nto support this.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. Right. So you didn&#x27;t answer my question. Do you \\\\nconsider the southern border to be a disaster? Because \\\\notherwise it would be inconsistent with FEMA&#x27;s mission. Because \\\\nyour mission says you are supposed to deal with disasters.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. FEMA&#x27;s mission is to help people before, \\\\nduring, and after disasters. But we also have a great level of \\\\ntechnical capability to provide assistance and technical \\\\nassistance to solve many different problems.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. Sure, but that exists in the entire government. \\\\nI mean, every, believe me, grants are administered in the \\\\nentire government. Your agency is the only one that administers \\\\nlocal grants.\\\\n    So I am just curious to who, you know, what rocket \\\\nscientists made the decision to actually put a border issue \\\\ninto FEMA? Because my people, you know, I represent the low-\\\\nlying eastern shore of Maryland.\\\\n    I want to thank you, by the way, for the work you&#x27;re doing \\\\nwith Crisfield on resiliency. They think of disasters as \\\\nsomething that is not man made.\\\\n    I think most people would agree that the southern border \\\\ndisaster is a man-made disaster made by the person in the White \\\\nHouse, you know, a mile down Pennsylvania avenue here.\\\\n    And I think it dilutes FEMA, because when I go and my \\\\npeople tell me, well, you know, I want to get, you know, you \\\\nshould get money to FEMA. I go, why? So they can help people \\\\ncross the border illegally?\\\\n    This is a sizable chunk of money, because if I am reading \\\\nit correctly, it not only announces $300 million in direct \\\\nfunding to communities. Now, which is the largest recipient of \\\\nthat $300 million, which community?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I will have to get that data for you.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. You don&#x27;t know about $300 million that was \\\\nreleased last week by your administrator, by your \\\\nadministration.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I just don&#x27;t have the breakdown----\\\\n    Dr. Harris. Well, which of the three largest communities, \\\\nwhich were the ones that were the big guys in this?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Certainly there are----\\\\n    Dr. Harris. Was it New York? Was New York one of them?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. New York perhaps was one of them, and again, \\\\nI don&#x27;t have the breakdown.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. Did you come from New York?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I spent 2 years in New York.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. You did? So you actually were employed by New \\\\nYork City. And New York is now one of the largest recipients of \\\\na grant that I would suggest some members think makes our \\\\nborders less secure than more secure.\\\\n    OK. Might be a coincidence, but if you can get that \\\\ninformation to me, I would appreciate that because I would like \\\\nto know where those--my constituents would like to know where \\\\nthose $300 million are going.\\\\n    Now, there is also $340 million in what is called $340 \\\\nmillion to the Shelter and Services Program, competitive grant \\\\nprograms to be allocated for the end of this fiscal year. So is \\\\nthat going to NGO&#x27;s?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. So the SSP program FEMA administers, as \\\\ndirected by Congress, to provide funding to support communities \\\\nand nonprofit organizations that are experiencing costs to \\\\nsupport migration.\\\\n    It has always been intended that when the--when Congress \\\\ndirected it to be changed to SSP----\\\\n    Dr. Harris. I only have a limited amount of time. We are \\\\ntalking about the grant program, because I am assuming that the \\\\n$300 million that goes to communities is different from the \\\\n$340 million. That&#x27;s what your press release.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Right.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. I mean, this is, this is your press release.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. No, yes.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. So I am asking specifically about the grant \\\\nprogram.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. The grant program was always intended to be a \\\\ncompetitive grant program. When it turned from EFSP-H to the \\\\nSSP program, however, with the late appropriation, we had \\\\ndetermined we needed to do a direct allocation to get money \\\\ninto the hands of organizations that were experiencing costs \\\\nwhile we stood up the competitive program.\\\\n    It will be a competitive program going forward. Any \\\\njurisdiction would be eligible that has costs there----\\\\n    Dr. Harris. When you mean jurisdiction--when you mean \\\\norganizations, you mean jurisdictions?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. It can be a city. It can be a nonprofit \\\\norganization.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. OK. So if you get the information on who are \\\\nthe largest recipients, I would appreciate that.\\\\n    Now, my real concern is in the last line of this press \\\\nrelease, because this is characteristic across the \\\\nadministration.\\\\n    You are aware that we have limitation amendments in all the \\\\nappropriations bills that prohibit lobbying Congress; is that \\\\nright?\\\\n    So your line that says DHS continues to call on Congress to \\\\npass this, the Bipartisan Border Security Agreement. You don&#x27;t \\\\nconsider that lobbying? Putting that in a press release?\\\\n    I mean, this is a press release from your agency, right? \\\\nYou are aware of the limitation amendment?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I am.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. It says you are not to lobby Congress to spend \\\\ntaxpayer dollars to lobby Congress. And it says DHS continues \\\\nto call on Congress.\\\\n    Now, I don&#x27;t know. Call on sounds like a synonym for \\\\nlobbying. I don&#x27;t know, maybe not, to pass the Bipartisan \\\\nBorder Security Agreement. Is it your opinion that is not \\\\nlobbying?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. It is my opinion that is not lobbying.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. And why is it your opinion that calling on \\\\nCongress to do something is not lobbying? I am a member of \\\\nCongress and I am reading this. How is that not lobbying me?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Sir, we call on you to pass the budget at the \\\\nsame time right? These are acts that we know will make a \\\\ndifference in supporting these communities, your jurisdictions.\\\\n    Dr. Harris. We, believe me, on this side of the dais we \\\\nfully understand what lobbying is. We fully understand what \\\\nthis administration is attempting to do. We fully understand \\\\nthat the border is a disaster, but it is a manmade disaster.\\\\n    And honestly, I think this administration is skirting the \\\\nlobbying restriction. And I hope that the next administration \\\\ntakes people, like yourself who are lobbying Congress actively \\\\nthrough their communications office and actually prosecutes \\\\nthem under the Deficiency Act.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Any follow ups?\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. A couple of things. Talking about missions \\\\nthat FEMA does, FEMA also has a significant counterterrorism \\\\nmission also, is that correct?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. We have some counterterrorism grants that we \\\\nprovide and support that.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK, good. So in other words, FEMA&#x27;s mission \\\\nhas long been beyond natural disasters also?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. FEMA&#x27;s mission has always been to help solve \\\\nsome of our nation&#x27;s toughest problems, regardless of the cause \\\\nof those problems.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And the different locations where the money \\\\nwent to, the $300 million, 275 is already published online; is \\\\nthat correct?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. For the SSP program?\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. That is correct.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK. Let me ask you, Stonegarden, again, this \\\\nis another program, I think it was in 2008 that Congressman \\\\nJohn Congleton from Houston and myself, helped set up back in \\\\n2008, that just want to make sure we are still with the intent, \\\\njust like the Food and Shelter Program, I think it was called \\\\nat that time, not the Food and Shelter Program. It was the \\\\nBorder Humanitarian Relief Fund. I think that was----\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. It was ESFP, the Emergency Food and Shelter \\\\nProgram for Humanitarian Efforts. That was the precursor to the \\\\nShelter and Services Program.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Correct. Can you tell me, let&#x27;s talk about \\\\nStonegarden a little bit. That is another program that I have \\\\nbeen involved in from the very beginning.\\\\n    How is that money used and how is that determined? FEMA \\\\nthen gives it to the state, and then the Border Patrol chief \\\\ngets together with the local sheriff and then they decide? Can \\\\nyou go through that process? Because there have been times \\\\nwhere you will have a county judge say, oh, no, I am in charge \\\\nof this, not the sheriff.\\\\n    Again, our intent was Border Patrol chief sits down with \\\\nthe sheriff and then they decide how to go with that, even \\\\nthough the county gets the money.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Yeah, absolutely, Ranking Member Cuellar.\\\\n    The Operation Stonegarden Program that we have is \\\\nincredibly important tool that we have to help primarily our \\\\nborder communities enhance their capability and the cooperation \\\\namongst the agencies that are there. As we get appropriated the \\\\nfunding CBP works to provide us data as to the algorithm they \\\\nuse with threat and risk to identify which jurisdictions need \\\\nwhich amount of money, and we have an algorithmic formula that \\\\ngoes into that. I would say historically approximately 70 \\\\npercent of the Operation Stonegarden funding goes to border \\\\ncommunities.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Can you get us the percentage also on that? \\\\nOriginally, again, just like the humanitarian relief, there was \\\\na Southwest border, but I guess once people see a pot of money \\\\nthey start looking at it. Same thing happened here. It was \\\\nSouthwest border, and then after that--nothing against the \\\\nNorthern border, but then the Northern border shouts, ``Hey, we \\\\nare border also,&#x27;&#x27; so we went.\\\\n    Then under the prior administration there was a contestant \\\\nstate called Florida, and also money started going to Florida. \\\\nWhere there was originally a Southwest border went to the \\\\nNorthern border, which I can support, but then into Florida. \\\\nHow much money goes into Florida? Nothing against Florida, but \\\\nagain it is--you understand where I am coming from. A lot of \\\\nthis--those two programs were Southwest border, and then once \\\\npeople see a pot of money they start saying, well, we want a \\\\npiece of that pot of money. Do you have the breakdown on that?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. The only breakdown I have, Ranking Member \\\\nCuellar, is about 70 percent goes to Southwest border \\\\ncommunities. I don&#x27;t have the breakdown for Florida \\\\nspecifically. I do have a breakdown for Texas which received \\\\nabout $37 million this past year.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. So my question was when Border Patrol sets up \\\\nthis plan with the sheriff, it is something that the sheriff \\\\nand the Border Patrol decide what the plan is, is that correct, \\\\nnot the county judge but the sheriff? Do you have that much \\\\ndetail, or can you follow up on that?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I can certainly follow up to make sure I am \\\\nclear on what you are asking. I know CBP works with the \\\\ncommunities to understand what the sector level risk is to \\\\ndetermine what the allocations are, but I think what you are \\\\nasking is how they administer the funding and who puts that \\\\nplan together for administering. Am I understanding correctly?\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Yes. If you don&#x27;t have that it is fine. We can \\\\nfollow up.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. We are happy to set up a briefing to give you \\\\nmore detail about from appropriation to spending the money and \\\\nwhat that all looks like.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. If you don&#x27;t mind, a little flowchart on that. \\\\nCan they also use that money--can local sheriffs or police use \\\\nsome of that money to buy drones?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I&#x27;m not sure if drones are an authorized \\\\nexpense. We can certainly get that for you.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK. And for areas like in the Southwest border \\\\ndrones would be good where local sheriffs can use that in \\\\ncoordination with Border Patrol.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I just don&#x27;t know off the top of my head if \\\\nthat is one of the allowable expenses. There are a number of \\\\nresources that are certainly eligible expenses that enhance the \\\\nsecurity, and so we will certainly get you that information.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK. And then finally my time is up, but can \\\\nyou also let me know out of Stonegarden how much go to the \\\\nstates? Because I don&#x27;t like when states they were the part of \\\\nthe money. I want it to go to directly to the local sheriffs, \\\\nlocal police sheriffs. If you can get that.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And with that my time is up. I just want to \\\\nsay thank you so much for the work that you all do. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Mr. Newhouse, follow-up.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I understand, Madam \\\\nCriswell, that the agency is forming an Office of Climate \\\\nAdaptation. My reports that I am hearing that we are seeing \\\\nmultiple individuals earning over $100,000 a year which \\\\ncertainly is competitive, but in my district that is a lot of \\\\nmoney. And I would just like to ask some questions about the \\\\nnecessity of a new office to respond to climate. While I \\\\ncertainly have a lot of good things to say about FEMA but also \\\\nsome complaints I have heard about time and coming up with \\\\nmeaningful response.\\\\n    Sometimes some of the issues are not resolved for over a \\\\nyear many of the things that people are waiting for to help \\\\nrebuild communities, and so forth. So I just would like some \\\\nclarification as to the direction that you are taking the \\\\nagency.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. So we recently did a reorganization of the \\\\nresilience side of FEMA, and that is the side of our agency \\\\nthat focuses on the before, helping people build more resilient \\\\ncommunities through our mitigation projects or through \\\\nindividual preparedness or educating communities on what is in \\\\nthe realm of possibility.\\\\n    I think as we see the increase in the number of severe \\\\nweather events and the cost of these events that these \\\\ncommunities are experiencing we want to make sure that we are \\\\nlifting up all of the work that FEMA does before to help \\\\ncommunities become stronger because every dollar that we invest \\\\nin mitigation saves six dollars in the response and the \\\\nrecovery cost.\\\\n    And so as we form an Office of Climate Adaptation it is \\\\nreally focused on helping communities understand what they can \\\\ndo to become more resilient and withstand the impacts that \\\\nthese severe weather events are causing.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. And that work is just getting off the ground?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. This is work that we have always been doing \\\\nas part of our agency. It has always been part of our mission \\\\nset. We have just organized it in a way that our state and \\\\nlocal jurisdictions now have a central point that they know \\\\nthey can reach out to to get information, technical assistance \\\\nto help them better understand the steps that they can take to \\\\nmake their communities more resilient.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. No further \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Cloud, the floor \\\\nis yours. OK. Time is up.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you for your generous----\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Mr. Cuellar said enough from the Lone Star \\\\nState, so thank you for your good sportsmanship.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. And he did a good job, and I would echo the \\\\nsentiments. I was looking through a number of different \\\\nprograms as well, and it seems like communities like New York \\\\nCity and other communities are getting a lion&#x27;s share of some \\\\nof the funding on a number of these grants when we have been \\\\ndealing with this for several years and certainly have a much \\\\nhigher influx. So I would ask you to look at how that is being \\\\ndone in the grant-writing process.\\\\n    I wanted to first of all just thank you on behalf of FEMA \\\\nfor the great work being done. I am in a coastal district which \\\\njust a week ago cut the ribbon on the Packery Channel which was \\\\na Hurricane Harvey project that has taken some years to get \\\\ndone. I know there is still arbitration, over a couple million \\\\nthat is left to be done, and I would ask you all to work on \\\\nthat. I think there is a strong case for that being settled.\\\\n    But FEMA has made some progress over the years. I can \\\\nassure you there is still some work to be done, obviously, but \\\\nfrom where we were right after Harvey and the things that we \\\\nare having to deal with there has been some efforts to \\\\nstreamline processes and such. We are still working on this. I \\\\nhave another city manager in a town of about 20,000 who has \\\\napplied for a hazard mitigation grant for their generator for \\\\ntheir city, 20,000 people, small town.\\\\n    A lot of these small towns do not have the army of lawyers \\\\nand grant writers and researchers and those kind of things, and \\\\nI have long advocated for maybe we need a streamlined process \\\\nfor rural communities that are asking for these small dollar \\\\ngrants that they don&#x27;t have to go through the same process that \\\\na larger community asking for million dollar grants might need \\\\nto go. I asked more details on this.\\\\n    Apparently their application was submitted November 5, \\\\n2021, and they are wondering if they are going to be able to \\\\nget it in time for hurricane season this year. So that is still \\\\noutstanding, and I would ask that we just continue to look at \\\\nthat and make sure that rural communities aren&#x27;t overlooked. \\\\nThey are having a hard time competing for these dollars because \\\\nof their staffing situation, but thank you very much for the \\\\nwork that is being done.\\\\n    I wanted to of course touch on the Southwest border. When \\\\nwe go and talk to the Border Patrol agents about what is going \\\\non and we try to figure out the dollar about what is happening, \\\\na lot of the dollars are being compartmentalized. So migrants \\\\ncome to the border. They are processed. I am not going to get \\\\ninto all of that because that is a different hearing for a \\\\ndifferent time. But we get to a certain point where it is like \\\\nwe handoff the migrants to NGOs, and they are getting funded by \\\\nFEMA, but we have no idea how that is working.\\\\n    This is one of the several, a handful at least of extra \\\\nStafford Act missions I guess that FEMA has been on in the last \\\\nfew years. I was wondering if you could list the extra Stafford \\\\nAct missions that FEMA has been involved with over the last \\\\nfive years or so.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. So non-Stafford Act missions that we have \\\\nbeen involved with?\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Right.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Yes. Again FEMA&#x27;s expertise that we bring to \\\\nthe table is certainly our ability to respond and recover to \\\\ndisasters and those that reach the level of a presidential \\\\ndisaster declaration, but we are also as emergency managers I \\\\nalways like to say is chief problem solvers, and our regional \\\\nadministrators provide a number of different forms of technical \\\\nassistance to our states and our local jurisdictions, the \\\\nemergency managers in those communities, on a wide variety of \\\\nproblems, situations that they are facing even if they don&#x27;t \\\\nrise to the level of a Stafford Act declaration.\\\\n    Specifically I can tell you one of the areas one thing that \\\\nwe did do last year was send what we call a federal disaster \\\\nrecovery coordinator to East Palestine, OH, an executive order \\\\nthat the president issued, and we were able to appoint one of \\\\nour individuals that is trained in this ability to collaborate.\\\\n    And again one of FEMA&#x27;s greatest strengths is the ability \\\\nto provide that technical assistance but also to convene the \\\\nright people to come to the table and to ensure that everybody \\\\nthat has a role to play whether it is our federal partners or \\\\nin this case a private sector partner is doing what they can to \\\\nsupport that community being done outside of our Stafford Act \\\\nauthorities.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. And there has not been a presidential \\\\ndeclaration, emergency declaration related to the border?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Not that I am aware of.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Not that I am aware of either. Do you understand \\\\nwhy? If FEMA is involved, we must think it is a disaster of \\\\nsome sort of some sort of emergency.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. FEMA&#x27;s role in the border is specifically to \\\\nadminister the grant as directed by Congress, which is the \\\\nShelter and Services Program grant, and our Grant Preparedness \\\\nDirectorate that administers all of our grants who are experts \\\\nat administering grants are doing that, and that is our role in \\\\nsupporting the border.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. I want to speak to one other thing. During a \\\\nMarch--oh, I am over time. My apologies, Chairman. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. You are welcome.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Sorry to wake you up.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Well, actually, I woke up quicker than you did. \\\\nThank you for that observation. The gentleman from Florida is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Criswell, I \\\\nwant to talk to you about your role as chief problem solver. \\\\nYou mentioned that a second ago. I can tell you I have worked \\\\nwith FEMA as a sheriff for many, many years in Northeast \\\\nFlorida through a lot of our hurricane challenges and all of \\\\nthat. I will tell you, and I think we spoke about this last \\\\nyear, one of the real challenges that we have in mitigation and \\\\nrecovery is dealing with the supply chains on these \\\\ntransformers. It is getting critical I think.\\\\n    What I am hearing back home this year the smaller ones not \\\\nso much of a problem. Maybe a few months. But the large \\\\ntransformers they are talking about a year, more than a year. \\\\nAre you all working with anyone to try and address the supply \\\\nchain issue on these big transformers?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Congressman Rutherford, I know we have had \\\\nthis conversation before, and I appreciate your continued \\\\nconcern. After you first raised this, we had conducted a supply \\\\nchain analysis specifically to look at transformers as well as \\\\nother supply chain shortfalls that we might experience going \\\\ninto that hurricane season. I believe this was two years ago \\\\nthat we first had this conversation.\\\\n    I think as we talked about at the time there wasn&#x27;t an \\\\nissue going into the year, but if there were a large number \\\\nthat were used we potentially would see an impact going \\\\nforward. As we continue to go into this hurricane season we are \\\\nnot seeing an impact to our ability to respond to this \\\\nhurricane season although we do continue to work with our \\\\nprivate sector partners to monitor this because we want to make \\\\nsure----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Can I interrupt and ask what are the \\\\nstockpiles looking like?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. So we do not have stockpiles. FEMA does not \\\\nmaintain stockpiles for transformers. We work with our----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. I mean private industry.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell [continuing]. Private sector industries.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Private industry. Do you know what they \\\\nhave? Has anybody assessed that?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. That would probably fall more within the \\\\nDepartment of Energy that would need to understand that. Our \\\\ngoal during a disaster response is to stabilize the energy \\\\ninfrastructure, and we do that a number of ways, through \\\\ngenerators as we had talked about, helping the private sector \\\\nrepair and giving them access to the damaged power line----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. So am I hearing you say then that FEMA is \\\\nkind of reliant on Energy to take care of the supply issue on \\\\nthese transformers?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. FEMA does not have a role in ensuring that \\\\nthe private industry has a supply of them, but we do want to \\\\nunderstand what they think their impacts are going to be.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. And we have done the supply chain analysis \\\\nwhich has shown that we don&#x27;t foresee a particular risk this \\\\nyear, but we do have a private sector office that continues to \\\\nstay engaged so we can better understand all impacts from the \\\\nsupply chain that might affect our ability to properly respond \\\\nand support a community that has been impacted by a severe \\\\nweather event.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. Well, thank you, and we will follow up \\\\nwith them on some of that, too. Another issue that I know we \\\\nhave talked about before is oftentimes there is quick \\\\nassessment, quick recovery, but then the reimbursement drags on \\\\nsometimes for years. A lot of these smaller communities the \\\\ninterest that they are paying is debilitating for them. Is FEMA \\\\nlooking at a way to maybe computerize some of this information \\\\nso that we can get billing done more quickly so those folks can \\\\nget their money faster than a year or two?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Absolutely. I mean, we have a number of \\\\nthings that we have done. One, with Congress passing our \\\\nstreamlined procedures, it actually takes the majority of our \\\\nprojects that are under a million dollars and puts them into \\\\nour simplified procedures language, in essence helping these \\\\nsmaller communities. The majority of the recoveries that they \\\\nare doing, the repairs they are doing would fall into that. And \\\\nso this is a new process for us that is enabling us to help \\\\nreimburse jurisdictions faster requiring less complexity. But \\\\nwe do have----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. That is new?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. That was in the last year and a half-ish, \\\\nyes.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. So some of the older ones are still \\\\nworking their way through under the old system?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Right. And what we have been doing is we send \\\\nteams. When a jurisdiction is really having a challenge, I can \\\\nsend a team right to them and work with them to gather the \\\\npaperwork. We have mechanisms to be able to advance funding if \\\\nit is a cashflow issue. We have a lot of tools within our \\\\ntoolbox, and if there is a specific jurisdiction that you know \\\\nof that is having difficulties, please let us know, and I will \\\\nmake sure we send the right people there.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you. I assume my time is up, Mr. \\\\nChairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you. The gentlelady from the state with \\\\nthe first round draft pick in the WNBA, Ms. Hanson, you are \\\\nrecognized. The floor is yours.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. That is right. We are very proud of Ms. Caitlyn \\\\nClarke from Iowa. She has upped the game so to speak around \\\\nwomen sports. We love Caitlyn and the entire team. They have \\\\ndone an amazing job. And Lisa Bluder, our great coach, too. We \\\\nwant to flag all those great women.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today and \\\\nto Mr. Cuellar as well for your comments. Administrator \\\\nCriswell, it is great to see you again. Thank you so much for \\\\nbeing before us today. Last year I believe I flagged for you \\\\nthe challenges surrounding building codes for the competitive \\\\nBRIC grant process and kind of how that put states like Iowa \\\\nkind of on the back burner in terms of being competitive for \\\\nthose grants.\\\\n    So I just wanted to tell you straight off the bat I \\\\nappreciate you working with my office and my team on that to \\\\nhelp make that process better in terms of eligibility, and \\\\nremoving those building code requirements will enable Iowa to \\\\nbe more competitive for those grants. So I certainly appreciate \\\\nyou working with our team on that.\\\\n    And I know FEMA recently migrated to a new payment system \\\\nfor states and localities, FEMA GO, and while commonality \\\\nwithin grant management system I think is a good step forward \\\\nfor the agency to better streamline I just want to make sure \\\\nthat we are prioritizing working through some of the bugs in \\\\nthe system. And there is one specifically from Iowa that I \\\\nwanted to highlight from 2022. Iowa Homeland Security Emergency \\\\nManagement mistakenly overdrew 40 cents on a grant, so very, \\\\nvery small amount. And normally they would do an offset on a \\\\nfuture draw, for example, to balance out that 40-cent \\\\ndifference, but FEMA GO does not allow for that.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. OK.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. And so Iowa had to write a 40-cent check and \\\\nsend it back to FEMA. FEMA cashed the check, but the credit was \\\\nnot made to their account within FEMA GO. So then every quarter \\\\nsince then they have received an RFI asking about the open \\\\nproject and the payment needed for that 40-cent difference.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Common sense would say that doesn&#x27;t seem \\\\nright.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Absolutely. What is your plan to address that? \\\\nI mean, obviously, you think about the administrative overhead \\\\nto go after 40 cents here on an agency level. Are these new \\\\nbugs? Have you heard about this from any other state or \\\\nmunicipality?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I have not heard about that at all. A number \\\\nof our state directors certainly are not afraid to share with \\\\nus some of the frustrations that they have, and we continue to \\\\nwork with them as we were rolling this out and now that it is \\\\nfully enabled. But this is a new one at that level, and so I \\\\nwill certainly take a look at that one.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. I offered to bring 40 cents from my tax check--\\\\n--\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I understand.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson [continuing]. To pay it off, but they said they \\\\nwere handling it. So I appreciate you getting to work with our \\\\nteam on that to alleviate user concerns going forward. Another \\\\narea we talked about, I mean, Iowa was going to experience \\\\nsevere weather today, already is right now. Last year we talked \\\\nabout the Next Generation Warning System Grant Program and what \\\\nit provides for resilience and security of public broadcasting \\\\nsystems when severe weather strikes. Obviously, that is \\\\nessential that communication for saving lives and helps make \\\\nsure that we can get those alerts out.\\\\n    One concern that I have had with that program is delays in \\\\ndeploying grant funding for the Corporation of Public \\\\nBroadcasting to administer those grants to local stations. I \\\\nthink when you talk about process, if FEMA awarded the grant \\\\nfunding in the first place to establish the program, why should \\\\nCBP have to--or CPB, rather, now have to run every grant \\\\nthrough FEMA granting authorities? Could there be a better \\\\nsolution there in terms of streamlining that process to make \\\\nsure that----\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I think absolutely. I did get an update on \\\\nthis situation here recently, and there are some challenges \\\\nwith how this program is being administered. And so we are \\\\nworking hard right now to figure out the best way to streamline \\\\nthat because being able to have the appropriate funding to \\\\nenable the Next Generation Warning System is really critical to \\\\nprotecting our citizens. We are aware of the challenges, and we \\\\nare working on them. We are happy to provide you an update on \\\\nwhere we are at.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. I certainly appreciate that. Obviously, they \\\\nknow what they are doing in getting those resources out the \\\\ndoor, and I think just streamlining it will help to make sure \\\\nwe can keep people safe as quickly as possible. It is critical \\\\nto their role in civil defense and public safety. I think that \\\\nis all the questions I had for this first round, so Mr. \\\\nChairman, I will yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for \\\\nfollow-ups.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you. I wanted to ask you about the--FEMA&#x27;s \\\\nprogram paid for the EFSP-H awards made under the \\\\nConsolidations Appropriation Act of 2023. There are a number of \\\\npayments that were made, millions and millions of dollars, but \\\\nwe are unable to find the details about what programs or \\\\nprojects or funds they went toward. I would love to see an \\\\naccounting on who is receiving these grants. Can you provide \\\\nthat to us?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I believe we should be able to provide you \\\\nwhatever level of detail you need on that first program, the \\\\nEFSP Humanitarian program which is now the SSP program.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. We have looked through the websites and can&#x27;t \\\\nfind anything.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I don&#x27;t think we would have it on our public-\\\\nfacing website, but I will be happy to have the team get with \\\\nyour staff and provide you a briefing on where the money has \\\\ngone.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you. That would be very, very helpful. I \\\\nalso wanted to ask you about a DHS OIG audit of FEMA. During \\\\nthe March 2024 testimony before the T&amp;I Subcommittee on \\\\nEconomic Development Public Buildings Emergency Management, the \\\\ndeputy inspector general for audits testified that FEMA&#x27;s use \\\\nof resources for non-natural disasters has revealed that FEMA \\\\ndoes not have sufficient controls in place to prevent fraud, \\\\nwaste and abuse.\\\\n    DHS conducted 18 audits over the past four years that \\\\nidentified overpayments, ineligible payments, unsupported and \\\\nunallowable costs totally approximately $3.9 billion in \\\\nimproper payments. That is a lot of money at least to some of \\\\nus. DHS audited and also identified an additional $45.4 million \\\\nin funds that could be put to better use. What are you doing to \\\\nwork on controls that could keep us from taxpayer dollars going \\\\nto waste, fraud and abuse?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Absolutely. I mean, we take any concerns \\\\nabout fraud, fraudulent use of our programs, very seriously, \\\\nand we appreciate the partnership that we have with the \\\\nInspector General&#x27;s Office. Specifically one of the items that \\\\nwas raised in there was regarding our lost wages program, and \\\\nthat is a program that was directed under the previous \\\\nadministration to support individuals that were impacted by \\\\nCOVID-19.\\\\n    In that program, it was directed that a self-certification \\\\nbe done at the state level, and that is where the I think \\\\nmajority of the issues that the IG found within that report. \\\\nThis is a program that was not necessarily designed to be part \\\\nof FEMA&#x27;s programs. It is not something that we have done in \\\\nthe past and certainly ever want to do again, but we do have \\\\nfor our traditional programs the appropriate level of controls \\\\nin place to ensure that the funding is going to where it needs \\\\nto be.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. OK. Perhaps we can meet with your staff to get a \\\\nbetter insight on that as well.\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Sure.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you. Appreciate it. I yield, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you for that courtesy. The gentlelady \\\\nfrom Iowa is recognized for follow-up.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I \\\\nmentioned, Administrator Criswell, we are in the bullseye again \\\\nfor severe weather today in Iowa, and we need urgent responses \\\\nobviously to deal with those natural disasters. A key stressor \\\\nthat I continue to hear about back home is the need for a \\\\nuniversal application for disaster survivors.\\\\n    It is extremely difficult, as you know, for them to locate \\\\npaperwork in an emergency, and it can be burdensome for those \\\\nwho are experiencing that devastation, lots of delays, \\\\nconfusion and not knowing how to coordinate all the information \\\\nbetween I call it the alphabet soups, the FEMA, HUD, all the \\\\nother federal agencies that someone may need to interface if \\\\nthe time of a natural disaster. The last thing they need when \\\\nthey are dealing with derecho wind damage, tornados, flooding \\\\nis burdensome paperwork, and having to submit dozens of \\\\napplications across several agencies not to mention they might \\\\nhave lost all those documents that they need.\\\\n    So could you describe how FEMA can maybe work better with \\\\nother agencies going forward to become more unified in response \\\\nto these disasters while also working to ease that paperwork \\\\nburden on our survivors?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. Absolutely. One thing that I will start with \\\\nis we recently released an interim final rule to how we \\\\nadminister our individual assistance program, and one of the \\\\nthings that we continue to have heard is the frustration with \\\\nhaving to apply for an SBA loan, get denied and then come to \\\\nFEMA to get assistance. And so part of this new release is we \\\\nhave decoupled that so we make it easier and have eased the \\\\nburden on the individual.\\\\n    Now they can either apply for both simultaneously or just \\\\ngo through the FEMA program, and we think that is also a step \\\\nin the right direction to really help understand what the \\\\ncustomer experience is and making sure that we are making it \\\\neasy as possible for them. But we continue to work with our \\\\npartners also at SBA to create a unified universal application, \\\\nand we have been ongoing discussions at the staff level on the \\\\nbest way to do that.\\\\n    Working through login.gov is one of the primary tools and \\\\nplatforms that we would be able to use, and so this is \\\\ndefinitely something that we continue to work towards. We are \\\\nnot there yet, but we were continuing to drive and figure out \\\\nthe best way to get there because we do know how difficult it \\\\nis to try to navigate, as you said, the alphabet soup, which is \\\\ntrue. There are so many different programs that are out there, \\\\nand we want to make it as simple as possible for them.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. And simplicity--obviously if you are entering \\\\nthe same information, and it is a redundant process over and \\\\nover and over again, I mean, that is the element of frustration \\\\nthat Iowans and Americans certainly face. So I look forward to \\\\nworking with you as you keep those concerns in mind going \\\\nforward to better strengthen that federal interagency \\\\ncoordination. I think that is going to be critical, and it will \\\\nsave taxpayer money, too, in the process, and I think that is a \\\\nwin/win.\\\\n    Other grant programs like NGWS, BRIC, Pre-Disaster \\\\nMitigation, Nonprofit Security or Firefighter grants where \\\\nyou&#x27;re seeing an increased level of applications and you are \\\\nmaybe unable to fund projects because of any budget \\\\nrestrictions that you might face?\\\\n    Ms. Criswell. I would say across all of our grant programs \\\\nthat are competitive they are certainly oversubscribed. I \\\\nbelieve our BRIC program this year is oversubscribed like five \\\\nto one for what we are going to be able to give. So that is our \\\\nnumber one tool that we have to be able to go out and build \\\\nresilience in communities. The Non-Competitive Grant programs \\\\nlike UASI and our state Homeland Security program or our EMPG \\\\nprogram they are limited at the amount of funding that is \\\\nappropriated, but we know that there is greater need because we \\\\nknow that the capacity at our state and local level is not \\\\nwhere it needs to be.\\\\n    And so that is the one tool that they have to help increase \\\\ntheir capacity to be able to respond and recover as well as \\\\nmitigate against these types of severe weather events. So those \\\\nare the programs that we would hope that we can continue to \\\\nfund to support these communities.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Well, Administrator, I find it incredibly \\\\nfrustrating to see a $4.7 billion slush fund request from \\\\nSecretary Mayorkas to direct those funds to deal specifically \\\\nwith misguided priorities at the Southern border for surge \\\\nconditions when these billions of dollars could be used to go \\\\nhelp those programs that are clearly oversubscribed and have a \\\\ndirect and immediate need and impact on our constituents. So I \\\\nwould urge the administration to prioritize here.\\\\n    Secretary Mayorkas just admitted last week in this \\\\ncommittee that there is in fact a crisis at our Southern \\\\nborder. They are redirecting your employees in many cases to \\\\nhelp deal with that, and I would urge the administration to \\\\ncome to center on this, make sure that the dollars can actually \\\\ngo where they need to go, declare the crisis at our Southern \\\\nborder and address this in a meaningful way. With that, Mr. \\\\nChair, I will yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you. Madam Administrator, thank you for \\\\nbeing the first victim participant, whatever, under the new--I \\\\ndon&#x27;t know what we call this, under the new whoever lost the \\\\ncoin flip for chairing this. And if there are folks outside the \\\\nroom listening, just to give an idea I have got a couple issue \\\\nareas that I would like to not talk with you about now because \\\\nquite frankly I don&#x27;t think a five-minute discussion is going \\\\nto be meaningful.\\\\n    But I do want to know--it has come up in the course of some \\\\nof the questioning--kind of the lessons learned when you talk \\\\nabout disaster relief funds and what you have learned from \\\\nimmediate needs, and that sort of stuff. And it is in the \\\\ncontext of so we know what we think we didn&#x27;t like. Here is how \\\\nwe lab to change that, or here is the help you need from this \\\\ncommittee or somebody else in terms of making you folks more \\\\nnimble, transparent, whatever the heck.\\\\n    Nobody leave the room and say that is a criticism. I am \\\\njust saying we ought to learn from our experiences, and that is \\\\nan area that we probably should. Another area that I am going \\\\nto want to talk about a little bit with you folks is on FMAGs, \\\\nand not that FMAGs are a Western thing, but not everybody is \\\\nlike California that has a multimillion-dollar agency that is \\\\nvery easy to work with and crosses all the Ts and dots all the \\\\nIs.\\\\n    I get the potential for abuse and all that other sort of \\\\nstuff, but I just kind of want to understand how those rural \\\\nareas, not just Western but rural in other parts of the country \\\\nthat may not have the luxury of an emergency management office \\\\nat the state level that is hand in glove with you folks what do \\\\nwe do to make sure that when they submit they are doing so well \\\\ninformed instead of somebody through the windshield of a fire \\\\nengine while they are looking at the flames which isn&#x27;t the \\\\nstrongest submission for you folks to carry out your mission.\\\\n    And then the last thing I think that is of interest is the \\\\nformula used to calculate allowable adjustment for disaster \\\\nrelief. Do you like it? Why do you like it? In the context of \\\\nsome of the testimony today once again what can we do going \\\\nforward, if anything?\\\\n    And then the last thing I want to talk to you about is the \\\\ntiming of responses which kind of ties into the calendar of the \\\\ncommittee. So we are going to have our last hearing on May 1, \\\\nand as we talk about try to do 12 appropriations bills, and \\\\nsomebody mentioned September 30, and I won&#x27;t even go there, but \\\\nwhen members have questions, or whatever, we will stand ready \\\\nto help you in terms of making sure that we get that \\\\ninformation exchanged so that we can proceed from the beginning \\\\nof May--I don&#x27;t know when the committee markup will be, but it \\\\nis like, hey, we would kind of like to--and nobody should leave \\\\nthe room and use the word haste, but you can use the word \\\\ncrisp.\\\\n    We want to get our work done in a way that allows the \\\\ncommittee to go to markup in a timely fashion, transparent \\\\nmanner, no surprises to anybody so that then we did get in the \\\\nqueue for big appropriations into that stuff and then go have \\\\nwhatever the rodeo demands on the floor. So we will be \\\\ntracking. If there is committee members that want to deal with \\\\nyou directly on things, obviously that is fine. We just want to \\\\ntrack it so it is not one of those things where we are waiting \\\\nto get a response, and it slows the committee stuff down.\\\\n    That doesn&#x27;t mean that we expect you to here is your new \\\\nmission in addition to everything else you do hoping that the \\\\nhurricanes don&#x27;t hit, and all the other sort of stuff. But \\\\nobviously, we are all in the multitasking business. So just \\\\nkind of forewarned is forearmed. So with that we will let you \\\\ngo. Thank you for your patience. Members may submit additional \\\\nquestions for the record, and we ask that you respond to those \\\\nin a timely manner. I am not going to define timely, but if I \\\\nwas going to it is a few weeks, not a few months.\\\\n    And if there is a problem with responding, then let us \\\\nknow. It&#x27;s like, well, we need a question clarified, or \\\\nwhatever. But anyhow we want to keep proceeding towards the \\\\ngoal line wherever that is. So with that thank you very much, \\\\nMadam Administrator, and we are adjourned.\\\\n    [Questions and answers submitted for the record follow:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n                                           Tuesday, April 16, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n    FISCAL YEAR 2025 BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY \\\\n                             ADMINISTRATION\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nDAVID PEKOSKE, ADMINISTRATOR, TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The Committee will come to order. This is the \\\\ntime and place set for the subcommittee on Appropriations to \\\\nhear from the Administrator on the TSA budget. I will, as I did \\\\nthis morning, skip the opening statement from the new guy on \\\\nthe committee, since Mr. Cloud did not express any particular \\\\ninterest and want to hear it. And so we will go with his lead.\\\\n    Mr. Ranking Member--I will pay for it up to 20 bucks.\\\\n    Mr. Ranking Member, we recognize you for your opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Cloud wanted \\\\nto hear my full statement, so I will try not to read all of it \\\\non that. And, Mr. Administrator--and, first of all, Mr. \\\\nChairman, thank you again, and members.\\\\n    Mr. Administrator, thank you so much for being here so we \\\\ncan hear about the President&#x27;s budget request for TSA for \\\\nfiscal year 2025. Again, we appreciate the work that you and \\\\nyour men and women do at the airports. So, we are here to talk \\\\nabout the budget but also glad that we are able to fully fund \\\\nTSA&#x27;s new pay structure for fiscal year 2024, demonstrating \\\\nCongress&#x27;s commitment to making sure that the TSA workforce is \\\\nbringing their salary schedule in alignment with their peers in \\\\nthe rest of the federal government.\\\\n    I also certainly want to talk to you about TSA&#x27;s mission, \\\\nwhich is very focused. And simply, it is to prevent large scale \\\\nacts of terrorism in the American transportation system. When \\\\nit comes to the flying public, TSA screens individuals and \\\\nscans baggage and cargo for that particular purpose. We look \\\\nforward to hearing from you, Mr. Administrator, what we can do \\\\nto modernize and streamline those processes, and what we can do \\\\nto assist you in your particular vision.\\\\n    Certainly, TSA is being called to do more in its role in \\\\nthe co-sector risk management agency for transportation systems \\\\nsector. And in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline attack, we \\\\ncertainly want to make sure that we all work together and \\\\nincrease in the cybersecurity posture and improving our risk \\\\nmanagement protocol.\\\\n    I also want to learn more--we also want to learn more about \\\\nthe current threat vector facing our transportation systems and \\\\nwhat investments should be included in fiscal year 2025 budget \\\\nrequest to shore up any gaps in this security posture.\\\\n    And again, as I mentioned, one of the things I am very \\\\ninterested in is customer service, customer experience. I think \\\\nwe all can say in the Loredo TSA, no problem at all. I think we \\\\nknow, most of them, they do good work there. But once in a \\\\nwhile, we run into an individual that does not show that \\\\ncustomer experience and certainly wants to see what you all are \\\\ndoing to do that on that.\\\\n    So with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you. And, Mr. \\\\nAdministrator, thank you so much.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Mr. Cuellar. We are going to \\\\ncontinue on with you for your first round of questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Well, I want to hear the statement first.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Oh, well, I was trying to help him out. \\\\n[Laughter.]\\\\n    We know you worked very hard on that. So please proceed.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Chairman Amodei, Ranking Member Cuellar, \\\\ndistinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to appear before you this afternoon on the \\\\nPresident&#x27;s fiscal year 2025 budget request for TSA. Mr. \\\\nChairman, thank you for our meeting yesterday. I look forward \\\\nto working with you, Ranking Member Cuellar, and all \\\\nsubcommittee members in resourcing TSA in fiscal year 2025.\\\\n    I enjoyed working with former Chairman Joyce on our fiscal \\\\nyear 2024 appropriation and wish Chairman Joyce well as he \\\\nassumes leadership of the Financial Services and General \\\\nGovernment Subcommittee.\\\\n    As I begin my testimony this afternoon, I start with the \\\\nsincere thanks to the subcommittee for the resources provided \\\\nin the recently enacted fiscal year 2024 appropriations. Thanks \\\\nto you and your staff&#x27;s work, my top priority for TSA, fully \\\\nannualizing our compensation plan, which allows us to pay all \\\\nof our employees at the same pay rate as the rest of the \\\\nfederal government, was achieved. Since this new compensation \\\\nplan was first implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year \\\\n2023, this had enormous positive impacts on TSA. Our retention \\\\nis up, we have many more candidates for open positions, and \\\\nmorale has noticeably improved, as reflected in the highest \\\\never FEVS results--FEVS, Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey--\\\\nresults in TSA&#x27;s history.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s fiscal year 2025 request seeks to build on \\\\nwhat was provided in fiscal year 2024 and recognizes that \\\\ndifficult choices need to be made, considering the funding \\\\nconstraints we face. I think it strikes the right balance and \\\\nwill position TSA to remain the agile security agency \\\\nenvisioned when we were established nearly 23 years ago. It \\\\nkeeps people first and continues smart investments in \\\\ntechnology.\\\\n    As an agency, we do our important work alongside \\\\ntransportation sector partners who are so critical to the \\\\ntransportation security of the sector. As threats to \\\\ntransportation have increased, we have worked with our partners \\\\nas they join us to improve security.\\\\n    Two areas that have been areas of particular focus \\\\nrecently, the first is combatting insider threats, and the \\\\nsecond is building cybersecurity, ranking member, as you \\\\nmentioned. We have worked hard together to strengthen security \\\\nplans in these two areas.\\\\n    Of particular note, pipeline, rail, and aviation owners and \\\\noperators have done a tremendous amount of work to improve \\\\nprotection of critical cyber systems and build resiliency to \\\\nensure those critical functions that Americans depend on can \\\\nquickly recover from a cyberattack.\\\\n    The transportation sector has seen a remarkable recovery \\\\nfrom the pandemic. Today, the aviation system averages 23,000 \\\\ndomestic flights per day and 2,600 daily outbound international \\\\nflights. Passenger volumes were up by almost 13 percent in \\\\ncalendar year 2023, as compared to calendar year 2022, and \\\\nseven of the 10 busiest days ever in TSA history have occurred \\\\nwithin the last 12 months. We expect to see some days this \\\\ncoming summer that will be particularly busy, exceeding 3.1 \\\\nmillion passengers per day, which would set another record. \\\\nThese examples reinforce the importance of partnerships within \\\\nthe transportation sector, and how performance based, and \\\\noutcome-focused solutions provide effective and efficient \\\\nimprovements to transportation security.\\\\n    An important priority in the President&#x27;s fiscal year 2025 \\\\nrequest is continued investment in technology at our security \\\\ncheckpoints across the country. Two ongoing technology projects \\\\nin particular are included in the fiscal year 2025 request. \\\\nThey both improve security effectiveness, efficiency, and the \\\\ncustomer experience.\\\\n    The first is our upgrade of checkpoint X-ray technology to \\\\ncomputed tomography or CT systems. At the rate of investment in \\\\nthe fiscal year 2025 request, which is $90 million, our Capital \\\\nInvestment Plan shows that this project will be complete in \\\\n2042, 18 years from now.\\\\n    Similarly, our upgrade of checkpoint identity verification \\\\ntechnology to include facial recognition increases performance \\\\nin this critical first element of checkpoint screening. At the \\\\nrate of investment in the fiscal year 2025 request, which is $9 \\\\nmillion, our Capital Investment Plan shows this project will be \\\\ncomplete in 2049, 25 years from now. We have the opportunity to \\\\naccelerate both projects with additional investment.\\\\n    For the past three years, the President&#x27;s budget has been \\\\naccompanied by a legislative proposal that would end the \\\\ndiversion to deficit reduction of $1.6 billion per year in 9/11 \\\\nsecurity fee revenue. The legislative proposal would instead \\\\nrestore all 9/11 fee revenue to aviation security as originally \\\\nintended. This diversion of security fee revenue began with the \\\\nBalanced Budget Act of 2013 and is due to expire at the end of \\\\nfiscal year 2027.\\\\n    Ending the fee diversion early in fiscal year 2025 would \\\\nprovide the flexibility to include more funding in the Aviation \\\\nSecurity Capital Fund and in our operating accounts. This will \\\\nallow us to complete the capital projects I mentioned just a \\\\nmoment ago and staff for passenger volume growth, amongst other \\\\nrequirements.\\\\n    Thank you for taking the first steps toward eliminating the \\\\ndiversion of a significant portion of this fee revenue in \\\\nfiscal year 2024. I look forward to continuing to work with you \\\\nto fully enact the President&#x27;s legislative proposal, end the \\\\nfee diversion completely, and direct all fee revenue to its \\\\nintended purpose of aviation security.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cuellar, thank you for your \\\\nsupport of TSA. I look forward to your questions and to working \\\\nwith all of you to ensure TSA has the resources needed to meet \\\\nits mission in protecting our nation&#x27;s vital transportation \\\\nsystem. Thank you.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Newhouse [presiding]. Thank you, Administrator Pekoske. \\\\nMr. Amodei had to leave the room for a minute, so this is not a \\\\nmutiny that we are staging. Although it could be. [Laughter.]\\\\n    But thank you for your testimony.\\\\n    I would first like to turn to the ranking member, Mr. \\\\nCuellar, for his questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you so much.\\\\n    I know you focus on innovation at TSA, specifically as it \\\\nrelates to technology. I think in your opening statement, there \\\\nis a reference to $18 million for the fiscal year 2025 request \\\\nfor TSA-specific research and development efforts.\\\\n    Looking at the future, can you tell us are you, is TSA in a \\\\nparticular position right now where we can have more of that \\\\ninnovation for transportation systems, or are we looking at \\\\njust simply hiring more personnel to build out the airports? \\\\nTell us a little bit how you can leverage technology. And, by \\\\nthe way, once you get rid of some technology, is there a way \\\\nthat you all can maybe provide that to local jails or local \\\\nfacilities that might be able to use some of your technology? \\\\nAnd I don&#x27;t know what your process is to deal with that.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. I will take the last part of the \\\\nquestion first. The process for dealing with excess equipment \\\\nfor any federal agency is to excess it to the GSA. And then the \\\\nGSA advertises it across to state and local governments and for \\\\nthe public, and then goes through a process to determine what \\\\nthe best use of that equipment is for.\\\\n    We have been doing that now for the past couple of years as \\\\nwe replace the X-ray technology with the newer X-rays, is \\\\nexcessing that through GSA.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. So we have to deal with GSA instead of you \\\\nall? Yeah, because I know a lot of the local sheriffs would be \\\\nvery, very interested in their jails. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. And also, you know, it would be of interest to \\\\nus to more target where that technology is placed, because \\\\nthere are certain needs we have within the aviation sector and \\\\nthe surface transportation sector where some of that technology \\\\nmay be of use, in addition to schools like you mentioned.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. There is a proposed amendment to the FAA \\\\nadministration reauthorization that would require TSA to \\\\nprovide secure escorts for individuals, Members of Congress. I \\\\nam not pushing this legislation. But commercial airports and \\\\nother requirements, and I think it includes family members and \\\\nall that. Again, I&#x27;m not doing that. But what sort of \\\\noperational impact would this legislation have, and what would \\\\nbe the cost to TSA to comply with this text of the draft \\\\nlanguage?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. We have, sir, had the opportunity to provide \\\\nsome technical drafting assistance in the draft language. And, \\\\nyou know, I would note that in this very budget that we are \\\\nconsidering now, the fiscal year 2025 budget, we are just \\\\ncoming off some actions in fiscal year 2024 that actually \\\\nremoved reimbursement funding for law enforcement officers that \\\\nwork in airports that are not federal law enforcement officers.\\\\n    So whenever I look at a piece of legislation, how it is \\\\npaid for is critically important. We have provided some cost \\\\nestimates for what it would cost. The challenge in developing \\\\ncost estimates though is, because of the way the requirements \\\\nare provided in the amendment, it can range from a very small \\\\namount of money to a very, very large amount of money, \\\\ndepending on how you interpret those requirements.\\\\n    And like you mentioned, it includes all Cabinet members, \\\\nall federal judges, and all Members of Congress, and their \\\\nfamilies and their staffs. And so you can imagine that is a lot \\\\nof people to ensure are protected along the way.\\\\n    So we are reviewing the legislation. I have no particular \\\\nposition on the legislation. We do not take those positions----\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And I do not want to get into the merits of \\\\nthat, but I just want to look at the costs. So what are the \\\\nranges on the costs?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Well, it would range from a very low figure of \\\\nabout $20 million up to about a half a billion, depending on \\\\nwhich element of TSA provides the service. I would submit that \\\\nif it&#x27;s for a credible individualized security threat, that \\\\nprotection needs to be provided by a law enforcement officer. \\\\nIf so, that takes it up to about $500 million.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And I will close with this, Mr. Chairman. \\\\nYeah, I don&#x27;t want to get into the merits of it. But just as \\\\nappropriators, we have to look at the money. So from $20 \\\\nmillion to $500 million.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    Administrator Pekoske, thanks for being here with us. And \\\\nfirst, before I ask you any questions, just let me say I want \\\\nto, through you, express my appreciation to all the TSA \\\\nemployees and the hard work that they do in a very sometimes \\\\nchallenging, requiring-a-high-degree-of-patience job. So thank \\\\nyou.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I want to talk first about the Federal Air \\\\nMarshal Service, which is a principal law enforcement \\\\norganization within the nation&#x27;s transportation system. The \\\\nroadmap that you released last year acknowledges that over the \\\\npast 20 years, the threat environment, I guess you could say, \\\\nhas evolved, requiring air marshals to expand their abilities \\\\nbeyond core in-flight law enforcement missions, and proactively \\\\noptimize law enforcement resources, which makes sense.\\\\n    So it was a little surprising to see in the fiscal year \\\\n2025 request actually, I think, a reduction in the Air Marshals \\\\ncategory, and it is described as strategically reviewed \\\\nattrition, so less funding is needed to support current \\\\nstaffing levels. And you talked about in your opening statement \\\\nthe importance of ensuring that the work force compensation \\\\nlevels are commensurate with that of other federal government \\\\ncounterparts, as well as for improved retention, all those \\\\nreasons. And yet that category I reduced. So I wanted to ask \\\\nyou about that.\\\\n    Then also, shortly after 9/11, Congress recognized the \\\\nimportance of establishing certain security standards for \\\\nidentification documents to fly commercially. Simply, you have \\\\nto have some kind of valid ID to present at the airport \\\\ncheckpoint. That, in coordination with DHS counterparts, TSA \\\\nhas identified acceptable alternative identifications for use \\\\nin special circumstances at the checkpoint. And that could be \\\\nseen as blatantly facilitating the illegal immigration crisis \\\\nby taking that action. This administration&#x27;s policy of allowing \\\\nillegal immigrants to use documents with unverifiable and \\\\nunvetted information to board commercial aircraft, on the face \\\\nof it, just defies common sense.\\\\n    So both those things, could you share the logic behind the \\\\nfunding reduction for the Air Marshals program while numbers of \\\\nillegal immigrants flying on commercial airlines, likely using \\\\nfunds provided by taxpayers, are increasing? And then also how \\\\noften can illegal immigrants use alternative identification \\\\nsuch as a warrant or a notice to appear, or the One app from \\\\nthe CBP to fly commercially?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. Thank you for your comments, first \\\\noff, on the TSA workforce. I greatly appreciate that. And I am \\\\nvery proud to have the opportunity to serve with them and \\\\nprovide transportation security across the entire United States \\\\nand indeed influence transportation security globally. So thank \\\\nyou for those comments.\\\\n    With respect to the strategic adjustments in the Federal \\\\nAir Marshals Service&#x27;s funding, what that basically stands for \\\\nis that TSA is now 23 years old, and we are reaching a point \\\\nwhere we are seeing more and more Federal Air Marshals eligible \\\\nto retire. And then when they retire, their replacements will \\\\noften be of lower band or lower steps in the band. And so this \\\\nis just an adjustment to account for that, a flow which we \\\\nanticipated several years ago. I mean, we knew we were going to \\\\nhit a point where we had a lot of people becoming retirement \\\\neligible, and they have a year limitation of 57 as well.\\\\n    But there is a reduction that affects the Federal Air \\\\nMarshal Service just to highlight for you, and that&#x27;s the VIPR \\\\nProgram, the Visible Intermodal Protection and Response \\\\nProgram. We have 31 teams comprised of seven Federal Air \\\\nMarshals that are stationed around the United States that \\\\nprovide a visible law enforcement presence to augment state and \\\\nlocal efforts, and we primarily operate, of course, in \\\\ntransportation hubs, both surface and airport.\\\\n    Our challenge before us is, hey, that reduction was put in \\\\nthere only because we have affordability issues, and what can \\\\nwe afford going into 2025. And the challenge will be if that \\\\nreduction is in fact appropriated, then we might have to stop \\\\nhiring for a couple of years, which we really do not want to \\\\ndo. Because what that does 20 years later is it means you have \\\\na gap in certain cohorts with respect to experience. And we had \\\\na period of time where we had a number of years where we were \\\\nnot hiring Federal Air Marshals and so we finally got back to \\\\nthe hiring process, and we would like to continue that.\\\\n    With respect to IDs by individuals that cross the southwest \\\\nborder, we have always endeavored to apply the same process to \\\\nevery passenger. So we have a process if any passenger shows up \\\\nwithout what we consider to be an acceptable form of ID, and \\\\nthose IDs are listed on our webpage, and we constantly revise \\\\nthat, we will find certain IDs no longer should be acceptable \\\\nto us, particularly as we are making more progress with Real ID \\\\nimplementation.\\\\n    And so if a passenger presents him or herself without a \\\\nform of acceptable ID, which would be anybody with a CBP One \\\\napp identification, that is not what we consider an acceptable \\\\nform of ID, we go through a process that does the best we can \\\\nto assign an identity and make sure we vet that identity. And \\\\nso that is what the One app is particularly good for. What that \\\\nallows us to do is when a passenger presents themself at the \\\\ncheckpoint with the One app, we can literally take their photo \\\\nwith a smartphone and then biometrically match the image that \\\\nthe photo captures with the person that was admitted by either \\\\nthe Office of Field Operations in CBP or the Border Patrol as \\\\nthey crossed the border.\\\\n    But for everybody that does not have an acceptable form of \\\\nID, U.S. citizens, non-U.S. citizens, everybody gets additional \\\\nscreening. And that is the part that is oftentimes lost in the \\\\nconversation. And so that additional screening is additional \\\\non-person screening and additional carry-on bag screening, and \\\\nwe do that to mitigate the risk of not being certain that \\\\nsomebody is who they indicate they are.\\\\n    And in a case for a U.S. citizen, what oftentimes is a \\\\ncommon occurrence is somebody might have their wallet or their \\\\nidentity documents stolen or they forgot them somewhere. And so \\\\nwe have a process to get to about the same point where we can \\\\nestablish an identity, but we are not sometimes as sure as it \\\\nwould if they had a credential, and we could run that \\\\ncredential. And so the same process, additional screening for \\\\nall those passengers.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. So how good is that? You can tell that, yes, \\\\nthat is the person that was apprehended at the border.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, right.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. But beyond that, there is no background.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. What it has is, when CBP, both the \\\\nBorder Patrol and the Office of Field Operations go through a \\\\nprocess to look at the documentation that the person had \\\\npresented at the border crossing, and to look at all the \\\\nholdings that we have to be able to attach an identity to that \\\\nindividual. So there is a lot of process that CBP performs in \\\\nthat regard. And then all of the documentation for that is \\\\nincluded in the CBP One app.\\\\n    From our perspective, we do require that the passenger \\\\nsubmit to facial recognition technology. So if you opt out of \\\\nthe facial recognition technology, we do not allow you to \\\\ncontinue with the screening process. But if we can match you as \\\\nbeing admitted by CBP, then we proceed with the additional \\\\nscreening.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I still have some questions about that, but \\\\nmy time has expired. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. OK, thank you. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Ms. Underwood.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Thank you, Administrator Pekoske. Thank you \\\\nfor joining us today.\\\\n    TSA plays a critical role in protecting our nation&#x27;s \\\\ntransportation systems and ensuring freedom of movement for \\\\npeople and commerce. While carrying out this mission, the \\\\nagency must balance safety and civil liberties. Using advanced \\\\nimaging technology is one way that TSA is ensuring the safety \\\\nof passengers. And with this technology, TSA agents are able to \\\\nsafely screen passengers for threats, such as weapons and \\\\nexplosives, without physical contact.\\\\n    There is no doubt that this technology has made our \\\\nairports safer. And yet even with the most advanced imaging \\\\ntechnology, diverse travelers are experiencing additional \\\\nscreening mechanisms, despite not posing any additional threat.\\\\n    Last year, the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, \\\\nreleased a report on TSA screening practices. In that report, \\\\nstakeholders weighed in on their observations. Some \\\\nstakeholders shared that, ``The use of advanced imaging \\\\ntechnology can result in certain passengers being referred for \\\\nadditional screening more frequently than others. These include \\\\ntransgendered passengers and those who wear religious headwear \\\\nlike Sikhs and Muslims, or those with disabilities.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I understand that TSA has a disability and multicultural \\\\ncoalition that collaborates with the agency to identify \\\\npromising practices for TSA&#x27;s nondiscriminatory delivery of \\\\nsecurity. Yet even coalition stakeholders share that, ``While \\\\nTSA has taken some positive steps that may help prevent \\\\ndiscrimination, it has not made meaningful changes to address \\\\nthe longstanding concerns that have been raised.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    At the time of GAO&#x27;s report, which was October 2023, TSA \\\\nstill had not collected data on referrals for additional \\\\nscreening or assessed the potential for its practices to result \\\\nin discrimination.\\\\n    Administrator, what specific steps does is the agency \\\\ntaking to better balance its use of advanced imaging technology \\\\nwith the civil rights and dignity of diverse passengers?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Thank you for the question. And I think we \\\\nhave taken a number of steps. We still have more to take. With \\\\nthe advanced imaging technology, we have recently installed a \\\\nsoftware update to that technology. So what that software \\\\nupdate does is it is better at detecting any anomalies that a \\\\nperson may have in areas that are sensitive parts of the body. \\\\nAnd so we knew we needed to focus there because we were seeing \\\\nin our testing results that that was where people were \\\\nsecreting things. And what the software update also did was, \\\\nimportantly to your question, it reduced the false alarm rate \\\\nby about 50 percent.\\\\n    And so when you alarm on any system, particularly on person \\\\nscreening, what we require to do is do a patdown, which is very \\\\nuncomfortable for passengers, very uncomfortable for our \\\\nofficers. That 50 percent reduction is real. We have seen it in \\\\noperation.\\\\n    We do have another software update in the works that should \\\\nbe out in the next couple of years that further halves that \\\\nfalse alarm rate and further improves the ability to detect. \\\\nAnd that will be coupled with an improvement in the antenna \\\\nsystems that are within that technology. It will basically go \\\\nfrom standard definition to a high-definition antenna system. \\\\nSo we think that with technology, we will make significant \\\\nimprovements.\\\\n    But to your point and to the GAO&#x27;s point, collecting data. \\\\nSo we are looking at data-based decisions, is something we are \\\\nworking very hard on, and we do agree with them on that point.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. And I just want to make sure I understood \\\\nyou correctly. Did you say sensitive areas where people are \\\\nsecreting things?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, in the saddle area of the body, \\\\noftentimes people will attempt to hide things and to bring it \\\\nthrough the screening process.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. OK. I am still concerned that the agency is \\\\nnot doing its best work to prevent discriminatory screening \\\\npractices. And even more concerning is that passengers who have \\\\nbeen wronged must jump through significant hoops to find a \\\\nremedy.\\\\n    For example, in the online forum to file a complaint for \\\\ncivil rights and civil liberties with TSA does not appear to be \\\\nhosted online in any language other than English. And in \\\\naddition, it is not clear that accessible options for those \\\\nwith disabilities are available. As your agency is working to \\\\nprioritize the civil rights and liberties of diverse groups, \\\\nwhat concrete steps are you taking to make the process for \\\\nfiling a complaint more accessible to non-English speakers and \\\\nthose with a disability?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. To your point, ma&#x27;am, is to put them in \\\\nmultiple different languages and to make them accessible for \\\\npeople that need to have other assists to be able to provide a \\\\nclaim. And important in that process is to make sure we update \\\\nthe individual as to the progress of that issue, because \\\\nsometimes it might seem to people that, hey, I submitted this \\\\nand I have seen no action in several weeks, I think it got \\\\nlost. And we do need to do more work to follow up with them to \\\\nmake sure that they understand that we are still reviewing it \\\\nand we will get an answer to them as soon as we can.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Is there a timeline for an online form to be \\\\nmade available in multiple languages?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. I do not have that today, but I can get that \\\\nback to you.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. I think it is just really important to make \\\\nsure that that is part of the work plan, to be accessible to \\\\nthe American flying public. TSA must ensure that it is working \\\\ndiligently toward its mission, and that includes respecting the \\\\ncivil rights and civil liberties of all passengers. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Ms. Underwood.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson from Iowa.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Mr. Ranking Member. \\\\nAnd thank you, Administrator Pekoske, for appearing before us \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    I want to start off by kind of building on something my \\\\ncolleague, Mr. Newhouse, talked about with the CBP One app. And \\\\nlast year, some of my Senate colleagues sent a letter to DHS \\\\nand TSA pointing out some of these challenges. And I mean, you \\\\nmentioned today that even maybe they do not necessarily meet \\\\nthe muster as acceptable ID. And so they pointed that out in \\\\nthe letter, and they have not received a response yet. And so I \\\\nwas going to ask you to respond to that letter.\\\\n    But I am going to ask you today to respond to me as well on \\\\nthis, clarify your processes in writing. You detailed some of \\\\nthose today for comparing IDs. Because I do want to make sure \\\\nthat the American people are not subjected to a substantially \\\\nmore rigorous screening process than some of these illegal \\\\naliens are as they are coming through our southern border. So I \\\\nwould like to make sure you follow up on that and I will follow \\\\nup with questions there, too.\\\\n    I also want to know how you are dealing with, and specific \\\\nto the Federal Air Marshals, we know that there is a huge \\\\nushering of illegal aliens on these flights in the United \\\\nStates. So how are you protecting the American flying public \\\\nwhen you are diverting these Federal Air Marshals to the \\\\nsouthern border to assist CBP in administering aid to illegal \\\\nimmigrants?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Congresswoman Hinson, thanks for the question. \\\\nAnd to your first request for process clarity, absolutely, we \\\\nwould be happy to do that.\\\\n    And with respect to your second question on Federal Air \\\\nMarshal deployments to the Southwest border, that is a very \\\\nsmall number, not a number I can give you in this setting. But \\\\nwe would be happy to brief you on that number and how it has \\\\nchanged over time.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. I have been briefed by the Federal Air \\\\nMarshals Council, and they say it is too many, right? And I \\\\nthink that is the biggest concern----\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Sure.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson [continuing]. Is that these Air Marshals are \\\\ndesigned to be keeping the flying public safe with the 40,000-\\\\nsome flights we have every day. That is their mission and that \\\\nis their duty. And so any instance where they are being pulled \\\\naway from their mission, I think, is a morale problem. You talk \\\\nabout recruiting and hiring and how much of a challenge you are \\\\nhaving there, having to rehire people who have been retired, I \\\\nmean, I think this is a long-term, huge recruitment problem if \\\\npeople are coming into this thinking they are keeping the skies \\\\nsafe and they are being diverted to the southern border. Do you \\\\nnot?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. I do not. First off, the diversion to the \\\\nsouthern border is a very small percentage, like I said. That \\\\nis a temporary mission, not a permanent mission of TSA&#x27;s. It is \\\\nsomething we started back in 2019, and we have made significant \\\\nimprovements to it over time. We have a memorandum of \\\\nunderstanding with CBP, which is the requesting agency. I would \\\\nbe happy to share that with you if you have not seen it.\\\\n    I will tell you from my chair, I am responsible for \\\\ntransportation security. I have Federal Air Marshals on every \\\\nflight I desire to have Federal Air Marshals on. Pure and \\\\nsimple.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. What risk algorithms are you using to \\\\ndetermine what flights you are pulling them off of?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. We determine the flights that we need to put \\\\nAir Marshals on based on risk. And I would be happy to give you \\\\na brief--again, not appropriate for this setting--as to how we \\\\nmake those decisions. And it is quite sophisticated.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Do you see a time in the in the future where \\\\nyou will not need to divert people to the southern border? Is \\\\nit dependent upon the surge slowing down, numbers slowing down \\\\nin terms of the number of illegal immigrants we are \\\\nencountering at the southern border?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, ma&#x27;am. Good point. That number has \\\\nchanged over time, and so it is lower now than it was five \\\\nmonths ago. And we will constantly adjust it based on CBP&#x27;s \\\\nneeds, which are predicated on the number of people coming \\\\nacross the border. And again, that is a temporary mission.\\\\n    I would also note that a mission of the Federal Air Marshal \\\\nService is to provide security at National Special Security \\\\nEvents, NSSEs, and we do that on a regular basis. So there are \\\\na lot of different things that Federal Air Marshals do, not \\\\njust in flight security, but in flight security to your point \\\\nis the most important thing that we do.\\\\n    But to give you a sense for overall levels of effort, if \\\\nyou look at the FAM deployments to the Southwest border so far \\\\nthis year, they are less than 2 percent of the deployments of \\\\nFAMs to in flight security. So it is very small.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Well, I want to make sure that that number--I \\\\nwould like to see that number get to zero, and I would like to \\\\nsee that number for sure not grow. I think based on my \\\\nconversations with the Federal Air Marshals they are very \\\\nconcerned about their duties being deferred to something else. \\\\nSo I just think that is a misuse of the workforce there, and \\\\nthey need to be doing what they do best, which is protecting \\\\nAmericans in the air.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. I would point out, though, that I don&#x27;t \\\\nnecessarily think that view reflects the view of the Air \\\\nMarshal Service. In the deployments we have had already this \\\\nyear, all of the FAMs are all volunteers, so if they felt that \\\\nit was not a good use of their expertise they wouldn&#x27;t \\\\nvolunteer. The only people that we have had to direct are some \\\\nsupervisors but a very small number of the total.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. OK. Well, I anticipate follow up on my \\\\nquestions from the first round, and with that I will yield \\\\nback. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Ms. Hinson. Going against the \\\\ndirective of the Chairman, I will turn to Mr. Cloud.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Did he say I could have a mic? Thank you for \\\\nbeing here, and I, too, want to touch on a lot of what has been \\\\nhad. I am from Texas, obviously, so I am concerned about what \\\\nis going on at the border. First of all, on your website there \\\\nis 15 identifications listed, and then as we have discussed, of \\\\ncourse, illegal aliens who come across our border are not \\\\npresenting those. They are presenting it may be right now an \\\\napp, and it is very concerning to a number of American \\\\ncitizens, including myself that it would seem that people who \\\\nare in our country illegally are under less scrutiny to use our \\\\nair services than American citizens.\\\\n    And keep in mind that your whole agency was stood up \\\\nfollowing September 11 when 19 foreign nationals \\\\nmisrepresenting their purpose for being in the United States \\\\nboarded our airplanes. So this is very concerning, obviously, \\\\nand especially when--the term you used I think was \\\\n``documentation&#x27;&#x27; that CBP looks at when people are entering, \\\\nwhich is a very generous assumption in the best case scenario \\\\nof somebody coming across our border because usually if they \\\\nhave ID they are dropping it at the border.\\\\n    They are coming across, and they get into our database just \\\\nby saying whatever they want to say. ``What is your name?&#x27;&#x27; It \\\\ncould be your real name, could not be. ``What is your age?&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nCould be your real age. Your nationality could be a made up \\\\nnationality, and that is by and large how a lot of our database \\\\nis being presented. And then you are saying that when they get \\\\nonto airplanes all you are doing is checking to make sure that \\\\nthey are the person they pretended to be before.\\\\n    So I think for most Americans they are going to say that is \\\\nkind of unsatisfactory. Could you speak to anything that you \\\\nare doing to firm that process up?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Well, I think, sir, the most important thing \\\\nwe are doing is they are all receiving additional screening at \\\\nthe checkpoint, all of them without exception. And that would \\\\nbe just like any other passenger who didn&#x27;t have an acceptable \\\\nform of ID. They all get additional screening. So we mitigate \\\\nrisk significantly in that process. That is an important thing \\\\nto keep front and center. Our acceptable forms of ID are \\\\nconstantly being adjusted, and you will see us come out over \\\\nthe next several months and further reduce the numbers of \\\\nacceptable forms of ID just to further strengthen that process.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. We were just talking about air marshals, and so \\\\nin the context that we have more people on our planes who are \\\\nnot here legally we also have less air marshals on our planes. \\\\nYou didn&#x27;t have the number available, but I think it is close \\\\nto 200 air marshals last fiscal year which is just under 10 \\\\npercent. So that is not substantial that were at the border.\\\\n    Senator Cruz sent you a letter recently. I don&#x27;t believe \\\\nthere has been a response to it yet. But the letter states that \\\\nair marshals are not even performing tasks related to the \\\\nsafety and security like they would be if they were still in \\\\nthe air. Instead they are performing administrative functions, \\\\nconducting welfare checks and escorting aliens to processing \\\\ncenters. Obviously, when we are funding an Air Marshal Service, \\\\nwe think we are funding the security of our country and our \\\\nhomeland specifically. So when we find out that no, they are \\\\njust being diverted to be more processing at the border, not \\\\neven protection at the border that is pretty concerning.\\\\n    You mentioned that that is only a handful this year. Is \\\\nthat new policy that has been put in place, or what are we \\\\ndoing to make sure that air marshals continue in what we \\\\nunderstand their stated mission to be?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. We put the number of air marshals down on the \\\\nborder based part on what CBP&#x27;s needs are but based mostly on \\\\nwhat our capacity to provide without impacting aviation \\\\nsecurity. So that has been the guiding post for us all along. \\\\nThe numbers will vary a little bit, but we have adjusted them \\\\ndownward this year already.\\\\n    The other thing to keep in mind is that the Air Marshal \\\\nService has many, many missions under its portfolio. One of \\\\nthem is to support other federal law enforcement agencies in \\\\nthe work they do. You mentioned that they were doing mostly \\\\nadministrative tasks. That is not the data that I have. We have \\\\nan MOU with CBP that requires that they primarily perform law \\\\nenforcement tasks when they deploy to the Southwest border \\\\notherwise we would deploy a different person to perform that \\\\nfunction.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Well, I can say just generally speaking probably \\\\n75 percent of the people on the mission down there to secure \\\\nour border are doing processing. Maybe you are saying they are \\\\nreplacing them, but we do need to get back to protection over \\\\nprocessing. That is a little bit outside of your jurisdiction I \\\\nrealize.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Right. But that is absolutely not the data \\\\nthat I have. It shows that they on occasion will do some \\\\nprocessing, but that by far is not the majority of what they \\\\nare doing.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Are you telling me I am out of time? I am up, \\\\napparently.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei [presiding]. We will turn from the gentleman \\\\nfrom Texas to Mr. Rutherford. The floor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pekoske, with \\\\nthe work that you have and following up on Mr. Cloud&#x27;s \\\\ndiscussion about the personnel issues and the number of FAMs \\\\nair marshals that are in the air versus the number that we \\\\nprobably need, when you and I spoke last cycle concerning the \\\\nVIPR program, you mentioned that that was kind of a way to give \\\\nthem something to do besides fly every day which I can \\\\nunderstand it could get tough. So my question is what impact \\\\ndoes that have on the availability of people in the air \\\\nprotecting the flying public? What numbers are being pulled off \\\\nof that job to do VIPR?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Sir, the VIPR program has a little over 200 \\\\nmembers to it. So when you&#x27;re considering----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. They are rolling in and out?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, they are. But a very important point to \\\\nraise here is that--and you and I talked about this last time. \\\\nI appreciate your time, and I enjoyed that conversation with \\\\nyou. One of the things I look at is particularly with the Air \\\\nMarshal Service do I have the capability to surge if the threat \\\\nindicates that I need to put more air marshals in play because \\\\nit is risk based. And sir, to your point we do try to balance. \\\\nHaving somebody flying for an entire career is not what air \\\\nmarshals need. They need to have balance in the whole process.\\\\n    So we are trying to find a way to build meaningful work \\\\nacross the entire transportation sector service and aviation \\\\nwhole but always have the surge capacity to bring air marshals \\\\nto in flight operations should the need arise.\\\\n    Another thing that is a big factor here is it takes a while \\\\nto develop somebody into a fully certified air marshal. That is \\\\nnot something that occurs in six months or even a year, so \\\\nhaving that capacity is really important to us. And the VIPR \\\\nprogram has been important to work alongside state and local \\\\nlaw enforcement officials to protect transportation \\\\ninfrastructure overall.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. And the budget for that last year of \\\\nfunding was about $60 million?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. I am sure you don&#x27;t have it, but can you \\\\ngive me a report on VIPR results, how many operations have they \\\\nrun across the country, how many arrests did they make, \\\\nwhatever you are grading the success of the program on?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. OK. Yes, sir. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Let me have that information.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Just one thing, sir. On the arrest data, when \\\\nVIPRs are working alongside state and local sheriff, you \\\\nunderstand this better than almost anybody, is that when an \\\\narrest is made our desire is to have that arrest be made \\\\nlocally because the processing through all of the judicial \\\\nprocess is much faster when you do it that way. So arrest \\\\nnumbers are not something that we particularly drive. We are \\\\ntrying to work with partners to support them in that effort.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. So you are not capturing it at all?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Oh, we capture it. When you see the number \\\\njust know that you are going to look at them and go those are \\\\nlow numbers, but that is why is that oftentimes----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. I just want the overall numbers.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Sure. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. What is the total number of arrests, how \\\\nmany were FAMs, and how many were state and local.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. OK. Sure. We will do our best.\\\\n    Mr. Rugherford. Thank you. And I want to get back to this--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. We gave you all of Mr. Cloud&#x27;s time, so you are \\\\nin good shape.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. The Federal Flight Deck Officer program, \\\\nthe facility that we were talking about in Atlanta, can you \\\\ntell me where we are at on that?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. We have the facility. We just \\\\nhaven&#x27;t had the funding to outfit it, and we are looking to do \\\\nthat in fiscal year 2025. The idea is that that would operate \\\\nat the same capacity that our two other facilities. One is in \\\\nAtlantic City, and the other one is in Dallas.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. So I think it said $16 to $26 million \\\\nin the president&#x27;s budget. Will that give you enough to \\\\nactually start running fulltime at that training center?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. It will give us enough to ramp up to fulltime, \\\\nsir. We are right now at about 25 percent, so we will gradually \\\\nramp up to a higher number, but we really do want that Atlanta \\\\ntraining facility in place because a lot of pilots come out of \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. Beyond that cache of money do you need \\\\nanything else to get that program fully equipped?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. No, sir. That program first and foremost that \\\\nis a fabulous program. I mean, it is incredibly cost effective. \\\\nHaving people that are trained to be able to protect the \\\\ncockpit in the cockpit is hugely valuable for us overall. \\\\nParticularly with all of the in-flight disturbances that we are \\\\nseeing it is very nice to have that insurance policy, and that \\\\nrelates to in flight security which is something that didn&#x27;t \\\\nexist. When the Federal Air Marshal Service was first formed, \\\\nthere was not a Federal Flight Deck Officer program. That \\\\nprogram took a dip during the pandemic. We are trying to get \\\\nour way back up to full strength because we think it is \\\\navailable.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. All right. I assume my time is up. I yield \\\\nback.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Mr. Cuellar, the floor it yours for a second \\\\nround.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Administrator, \\\\nthe Federal Air Marshals go down there, I think there is a call \\\\nfor a surge--I mean, you know, when there is a need for a \\\\nsurge, they are sent there voluntarily?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. The vast majority are volunteers. So all of \\\\nthe Federal Air Marshals this calendar year to date have all \\\\nbeen volunteers. Some of the supervisors have been directed to \\\\nfill some gaps that we didn&#x27;t have volunteers for, but the \\\\nstraight Federal Air Marshals are volunteers.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. My understanding is there are about 75 air \\\\nmarshals down there at the border?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Number we can&#x27;t specify on but----\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Roughly.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Roughly.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And now that the numbers have gone down from \\\\n10 to 12,000 a day, I think the last three weeks it has been \\\\nabout 3,800 between border, so hopefully you can bring them \\\\nback sometime soon on that. Let me ask you about TSA leveraging \\\\nartificial intelligence. Machine learning and security \\\\nscreening, they all use that?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And how are you all using that?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. One of the ways we are using it, and this has \\\\nnot yet rolled out, but if you put a carry-on bag through the \\\\nX-ray machine at a checkpoint, if you looked at the image that \\\\ncomes up, the image that the officers are looking at will have \\\\nany explosives have a red box around them. So the machine, the \\\\ntechnology, automatically detects explosives and the type of \\\\nexplosives that we specify for it. What it doesn&#x27;t do is it \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t automatically detect all the other things that we don&#x27;t \\\\nallow through the screening process like firearms, parts of \\\\nfirearms, ammunition, all kinds of knives, throwing stars, cat \\\\neyes, et cetera. So we are using artificial intelligence to \\\\ntrain the technology to detect all the prohibited items, so all \\\\nthe explosives and all of the other knives and firearms, et \\\\ncetera, that are there.\\\\n    The next step beyond that is that when we get that \\\\ntechnology deployed then images that would now come up for \\\\nevery single passenger--so I said in my opening statement that \\\\nwe are going to see some days this summer that might have 3.1 \\\\nmillion passengers, and you have to give 3.1 million is well \\\\nover 6 million images that these officers are reviewing on a \\\\ngiven day, that is a lot. And what we find in our testing is \\\\nthat constant review of images can be very fatiguing, and so \\\\ncan we put a machine assist there so that if a bag goes through \\\\nthe X-ray and doesn&#x27;t alarm, so the artificial intelligence is, \\\\nyou know, we would not deploy it if we didn&#x27;t fully test it to \\\\nmake sure it worked, then officers won&#x27;t view quite so many \\\\nimages, but when they do see one, they know, hey, this alarmed \\\\nby the technology, and they will be more focused on that as a \\\\nresult, because they&#x27;re as far fewer.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. And you are using that now? I mean, it is \\\\nbeing used right now?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. We are developing it now.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Developed?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Sir, the other area where we are----\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Is that in house? Vendor?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Vendor.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Vendor? OK.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Vendor and with Science and Technology in the \\\\nDepartment----\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske [continuing]. To make sure that we&#x27;re doing it \\\\nin a proper way. And as you know, there&#x27;s now an executive \\\\norder that governs artificial intelligence development that \\\\nwe&#x27;ve been fully compliant with all along.\\\\n    So there&#x27;s a lot of good oversight there.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK. I got a whole bunch of bridges in my area, \\\\nso trade is very important to me. There are times where we have \\\\npeak hours, like Laredo handles 17, 18,000 traders a day. And \\\\nI&#x27;ve asked OFO there, hey, why don&#x27;t you have more folks here \\\\nat this particular peak time?\\\\n    And they are--sometimes they say the union. There are \\\\ncertain union negotiations, and I am saying, well, look, \\\\nwithout respect to the unions, we got to take care of the \\\\ncustomers first.\\\\n    You all have unions now, correct? Now, for TSA? Is it too \\\\nearly to say that if sometimes the union demands, and again, I \\\\nsupport unions, but I just want to make sure that customers \\\\ncome first.\\\\n    Do your peak times sometimes collide with some of the \\\\nunion? What&#x27;s the right word to use? I&#x27;m trying to be \\\\ndiplomatic, Union demands.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. A couple comments. One is that we&#x27;ve \\\\nalways had limited collective bargaining since I&#x27;ve been the \\\\nadministrator.\\\\n    This year, we entered into a full collective bargaining \\\\nnegotiation with our union for our Transportation Security \\\\nOfficers, reached an agreement. We should sign that next month.\\\\n    And so it&#x27;s kind of too early to tell the impacts of that \\\\nCollective Bargaining Agreement, but we have had the ability to \\\\ndevelop a cadre of individuals, about 675 officers, that are \\\\nscreening officers, that are part of what we call the National \\\\nDeployment Force.\\\\n    And if we have a particularly busy time, let&#x27;s say after \\\\nthe Superbowl in Las Vegas, we would deploy those National \\\\nDeployment Force Officers from airports around the country, \\\\ndown to help out the Las Vegas team during a period of surge \\\\noperations.\\\\n    The other thing that when we ask for additional TSOs, I \\\\nwould really like to get to the point where we have a little \\\\nbit more flexibility in our TSO numbers, because right now it&#x27;s \\\\na very sharp pencil that we figure out exactly how many people \\\\nwe need.\\\\n    Life doesn&#x27;t work that way. People get sick. They have \\\\nother things going on. And then with any workforce, if you have \\\\na workforce and you never provide them any free time, they \\\\ncan&#x27;t take vacations like they would normally take. That \\\\nimpacts their availability anyway.\\\\n    And so what I&#x27;d like to do is just build up the size of the \\\\nworkforce a little bit more to provide that flexibility. So \\\\nthere&#x27;s a lot we have to do on our end to make sure that we \\\\nresource it well.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Right. And again, understand, and, you know, \\\\nmy time is pretty much up. So I just want to make sure that \\\\nthis collective bargaining, that I support unions, but I want \\\\nto make sure that we put customers first, especially at peak \\\\ntimes, because I have seen that in Laredo where I am like, you \\\\nknow, and they say that it is part of the collective bargain on \\\\nthat.\\\\n    But I appreciate what you all do, and please follow up on \\\\nthe customer service, customer experience. It is very \\\\nimportant. Like I said, most of my personal experience has been \\\\ngood, but there are times where some of those folks should \\\\nunderstand what customer service is.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. And we&#x27;re building that into our \\\\nentry level training now as well. We added a week to our \\\\ntraining and that week is focused on de-escalating situations \\\\nin checkpoint operations and interactions between officers and \\\\npassengers.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentlelady from Ohio is recognized for a \\\\nsecond.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Iowa.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Ohio. You just got the No. 1----\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Draft pick, that is right. Get your state \\\\ncorrect, Mr. Chairman. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. No more.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. We are hazing the Chair.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. No more second round questions. We are \\\\nadjourned until the Committee Members do some customer service \\\\ntraining.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. I am----\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. To the friendly--to the friendly representative \\\\nfrom Iowa. The floor is yours for a second round.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for the time. \\\\nI am so grateful that you yield that time to me.\\\\n    And again, thank you, Administrator Pekoske, for putting up \\\\nwith our antics today. I want to also express, I love our Cedar \\\\nRapids CID/TSA, frontline workers are awesome.\\\\n    I see them every single week when I fly twice a week, \\\\nsometimes more and they are great to work with. So I just would \\\\nbe remiss if I didn&#x27;t mention that.\\\\n    And in that note last year, obviously in this hearing, I \\\\nbrought up the story of Sergeant Dirks. And we have already \\\\ntalked about this, but the issues, of course, brought to the \\\\nattention of you and your team about the challenges that \\\\nveterans might be facing when they are going through airport \\\\nsecurity.\\\\n    And I want to thank you for working with us, setting up \\\\nthat walkthrough with Trent and Tracer. They were great sports. \\\\nAnd Doug and Yolanda, our Cedar Rapids folks who helped us \\\\nreally showcase and especially to local media, so that our \\\\nconstituents could know as well firsthand the issues that \\\\nveterans with service animals might be facing.\\\\n    So can you speak a little bit to kind of the follow up \\\\nthere? What has happened since that walkthrough? What are you \\\\ndoing to interface with veterans to make sure they have a \\\\nbetter experience on the customer service side going through a \\\\ncheckpoint?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Thank you. And thank you for facilitating that \\\\nconversation with Sergeant Dirks and getting to meet him and \\\\nhis team, bringing them down to the airport, getting their \\\\nfeedback on things overall.\\\\n    Good news is that he has joined our Multicultural \\\\nCoalition. So that is a great voice to have in that coalition. \\\\nWe&#x27;ve already put out additional guidance on our webpages.\\\\n    Hey, if you&#x27;re traveling with a service dog, here are the \\\\nthings you can expect going through the screening process. And \\\\nwe have a lot of social media capability within TSA, too.\\\\n    So if somebody tweets that, it will give them that answer \\\\nback, literally within a couple of seconds. We also have put in \\\\nplace passenger support specialists throughout our system.\\\\n    So if any passenger thinks they need additional assistance \\\\nin the screening process, they can call ahead and we will meet \\\\nthem and then help them get through the screening process, \\\\nwhich is really good for them.\\\\n    It makes them feel valued and makes them not feel \\\\ndeprioritized in the entire system. It&#x27;s also good for us \\\\nbecause it makes it more efficient overall. So really \\\\nappreciate the connect that you made there. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Yeah. No, absolutely. No and I think that \\\\nobviously there may be more work to do to make sure that is \\\\nconsistent across every airport experience, but I really \\\\nappreciate you being willing to work with us on that.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yeah. Thanks.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Another area that I wanted to just highlight, I \\\\nknow there is a lot of pressure on your technology budget at \\\\nTSA. It is a concern, obviously, for the entire transportation \\\\necosystem system.\\\\n    We all need the latest technology, and we want to make sure \\\\nthat is deployed in a timely manner to handle these historic \\\\ntravel volumes, as you talk about 3.1 million passengers \\\\npotentially a day.\\\\n    We know TSA has a donation program for airports and \\\\nairlines, the Capability Acceptance Process Program, is that \\\\nsufficient, would you say, to really address these challenges \\\\nwith all the stakeholders in the industry?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Well, the Capability Acceptance Process is a \\\\nreally good process, but it&#x27;s not the full solution. And I \\\\nreally appreciate the airports and the air carriers that have \\\\ndonated technology to us.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve had one airport recently that donated $30 million \\\\nworth of technology and a brand-new checkpoint. And it&#x27;s \\\\nspectacular when you visit the checkpoint. I mean, you have a \\\\nbrand-new checkpoint. You don&#x27;t want to have the older machines \\\\nthat are there. You want the newest technology that&#x27;s in place.\\\\n    The key thing, from my perspective, is we have two key \\\\nacquisitions going on right now. It&#x27;s the X-ray acquisition or \\\\nthe CT acquisition and the identity verification technology \\\\nacquisition. Those are both not going to get completed at \\\\ncurrent investment rates until the 2040s. One is 2042 for the \\\\nX-ray----\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. And 2049----\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yeah, and 2049 for the identity verification. \\\\nThat&#x27;s a very, very long time.\\\\n    I think part of the solution here would be to end that fee \\\\ndiversion and get that $1.6 billion back into aviation \\\\nsecurity, and that will give us a lot of flexibility.\\\\n    The other thing I think about a lot is we should get \\\\nourselves away from doing block replacements of technology. We \\\\nshould just replace them in a routine----\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. On a rolling basis?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Exactly. Because that way you&#x27;d have steady \\\\nstream. Vendors would see that addressable market out there. \\\\nThey&#x27;d invest more R&amp;D, get more competition, a better product \\\\nat the end of the day.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. One other thing I want to follow up in the time \\\\nI have left. How much time does it say over there?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. I&#x27;ve got as much time as you want.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Oh, thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. 48 seconds.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. You may change that tone after hearing my \\\\nquestion. No. The Washington Post recently reported we had \\\\nabout 300 passengers who snuck past airport security in 2023.\\\\n    They entered through exit lane areas, sneaking past ID \\\\ncheck areas at TSA checkpoints. So what are you doing to \\\\naddress those breaches in airport security? Is it an exit lane \\\\nstaff issue? What do you think the issue is, and what are you \\\\ndoing to address it?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Sure. First and foremost, zero of those \\\\npassengers, none got on board an aircraft without screening. So \\\\nyou know, that might alarm you when you first look at it, but \\\\nwhen you look at our, you know, we have a layered process and \\\\nnone got onboard aircraft. So that&#x27;s an important thing to keep \\\\nin mind.\\\\n    The vast majority of people that did get back into the \\\\nsterile area of an airport from the public area without being \\\\nscreened on their way back in were people who were outbound, \\\\ncoming off a flight as they were going through, turned around \\\\nand went back to get something that they thought they had lost.\\\\n    And so we see that we track those individuals to make sure \\\\nwe can locate them and then help them resolve whatever the \\\\nissue is they had and escort them back out.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Did you have any that were malicious intent \\\\nthat you could identify?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Not that we identified, no.\\\\n    You know, we have, in the checkpoint, evading the \\\\ncheckpoint operations. Sometimes people game that, and we do \\\\nhave some people that have tried to do it at multiple airports \\\\njust to see how far they can get.\\\\n    That&#x27;s a bit malicious.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. But part of the solution to the exit lane \\\\nissue is putting technology in place so you can&#x27;t go backwards \\\\ninto.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Yeah, we have those doors in Cedar Rapids.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Exactly, right.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Right, you are trapped basically.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Right. And those pay for themselves in about \\\\nthree or four years, rather than having people sit there and \\\\nthen just kind of watch folks to make sure they&#x27;re flowing in \\\\nthe right direction.\\\\n    The other is, you know, eventually, once we get our \\\\nidentity verification technology in place, is to then put e-\\\\ngates in place across, so that will prevent people from going \\\\naround.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. OK. Thank you, Administrator.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you for that acknowledgement from \\\\nsomebody in the midwest.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud, I believe the last time I checked, you are one \\\\nof the two people from Texas, so I don&#x27;t want any confusion, \\\\nthe floor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you, magnanimous Chair. And are you going \\\\nto hang around for this line of questioning or no?\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. So I am thinking the way things are going, I am \\\\nout of here lickety split, but thank you for putting that on \\\\nthe record for me.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. No, thank you. Where were we at?\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. We are at your time has expired. So now we will \\\\ngo to Mr. Rutherford.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Yes, thank you.\\\\n    I wanted to ask you about the Law Enforcement Officer \\\\nReimbursement Program, and you mentioned that you were making \\\\nsome cuts to it? I think, by my calculations, it is like 90 \\\\npercent, so that is pretty substantial.\\\\n    I am from a rural town and a rural community with a rural \\\\nairport, and so that is concerning to me. I am curious about \\\\nthe thinking there. And then also, I mean, what is the 10 \\\\npercent left for, if, you know? So I would be curious to get \\\\nyour thoughts on that.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. In the budget, we have proposed, for \\\\na good number of years, to reduce the funding for both the \\\\nCanine Reimbursement Program, which reimburses canine handlers \\\\nthat are operated by law enforcement agencies, and then law \\\\nenforcement officers that serve in airports, in and around \\\\ncheckpoints.\\\\n    The first year it was accepted by Congress was last year, \\\\nand so those are FY 2024 cuts. The hard part for us is that \\\\nthis is only because of budget limitations. No other reason. We \\\\njust don&#x27;t have the money.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. We plussed up your budget pretty substantially.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Right. But we had very high priority things \\\\nthat we needed to fund with that plussed up money. So it&#x27;s a \\\\nwhole matrix of hey, what&#x27;s most important? And then how much \\\\nfunds do you have available?\\\\n    I would go back to the $1.6 billion that we&#x27;re leaving off \\\\nthe table every single year from the Aviation Security \\\\nPassenger Fee. I mean, when you look at your ticket and your \\\\ntickets tab, it says 9/11 security fee, $5.60 one way, $11.20 \\\\nround trip, in 2013 in the BBA, the Balance Budget Agreement, \\\\n$1.6 billion in $24 and $25 goes straight to the Treasury \\\\nDepartment for deficit reduction.\\\\n    That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been trying to stop overall, and those \\\\nfunds will kind of lift us up substantially across the board. I \\\\nreally appreciate all the work that law enforcement officers \\\\ndo. The last thing I want to do is cut law enforcement support. \\\\nTrust me.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. All right. OK. Well, I appreciate that. On the \\\\nID issue, I had an interesting, you know, you were speaking to \\\\nsome of the most traveled people, obviously, in the country, \\\\nwhere I presented a valid boarding pass and an ID, and for some \\\\nreason it didn&#x27;t match in what was in the TSA system.\\\\n    I went back to the desk, printed it out again instead of \\\\nusing my digital one. It was the same case, and they were going \\\\nto not let me board the plane. And again, in the context of who \\\\nwe are letting board planes, I was curious as to how in the \\\\nworld that was even legally possible.\\\\n    And of course, the bigger concern wasn&#x27;t my one flight. I \\\\ncan get a different flight or whatever; is this happening to \\\\nother people?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Sure. And I would just go back and for those \\\\nthat don&#x27;t have acceptable ID, all get additional screenings so \\\\nthey&#x27;re not getting PreCheck privileges.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. What is the legal--like for somebody who is \\\\npresenting legal documents how is the TSA like, saying you \\\\ncan&#x27;t go on this flight?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Sure. Well, what happens there, sir, is that \\\\nwhen you make a flight reservation, we get the reservation data \\\\nfrom the carriers beginning about 72 hours out, and we start to \\\\nvet the information the carriers provide.\\\\n    And essentially what we&#x27;re doing is we&#x27;re taking your name \\\\nand your date of birth, and we&#x27;re matching it against our \\\\nholdings to make sure that, hey, if you are a PreCheck \\\\npassenger, we know you&#x27;re a PreCheck passenger.\\\\n    If you&#x27;re importantly a passenger that requires additional \\\\nscreening, that we identify you there as well. Sometimes that \\\\nmatch doesn&#x27;t work as well. You might have--there might have \\\\nbeen an issue where you had a middle initial once and didn&#x27;t \\\\nhave it a second time or yeah, some very small changes will--\\\\nyeah, very small changes will cause a mismatch there, and we \\\\nneed to be sure that the match is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. The flight number was just different in this \\\\nparticular case. But anyway, I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of \\\\ntime on that.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. OK. Sure.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. One other question, in whatever little time I \\\\nmight have, could you speak to ports? I am concerned about \\\\nports and our ability to understand what is coming into our \\\\nports.\\\\n    And we know, like China, for example, I think they control \\\\n80 percent of the cranes, which no doubt probably have some \\\\nsort of technology on them. I feel like they could probably \\\\nmake the argument that they might know more of what is going on \\\\nthan we do.\\\\n    I don&#x27;t know if that is exactly the case, but certainly a \\\\nconcern still. What are we doing, or what are the plans, or \\\\neven at a research phase to ramp up security at our ports?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. So that question is really better addressed to \\\\nCoast Guard, because they have primary authority over maritime \\\\noperations. But I will share that, you know, Coast Guard has \\\\nissued cybersecurity regulations, just like we have, within our \\\\nparts of the transportation sector.\\\\n    So we&#x27;ve issued requirements that are performance based to \\\\npipelines, to rail systems, to airports, and to air carriers. \\\\nCoast Guard has done the same thing to ports, and it&#x27;s a very \\\\nsimilar framework. So I know that they are working on this.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thanks, Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. You are welcome, Member.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Illustrious Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Mr. Pekoske, if you have the ability to, in \\\\nyour vetting of these sorts of things, pick some folks out who \\\\nare TSA PreCheck to deny boarding a plane, who happen to be \\\\nMembers of this Committee, we&#x27;d like to work with you to figure \\\\nout who we want this week in that.\\\\n    Because there are some weeks, and I won&#x27;t speak for anybody \\\\nelse on the Committee, it&#x27;s like, really, I can&#x27;t get on the \\\\nplane. Okey doke.\\\\n    And with that softball lead in, Mr. Rutherford, the floor \\\\nis yours.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Pikoski, I want to ask about the Explosive Detection \\\\nSystems that we put in several years ago in the airports, and \\\\nwe were going to do that reimbursement.\\\\n    I think we are just about down to--can you tell me what it \\\\nwould take to knock that out this year so we can quit worrying \\\\nabout it?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. $13.9 million.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. $13.9?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. That closes it out.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. That&#x27;s all of them?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. And I believe Jackson is about $1.1, $1.046.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. Thank you.\\\\n    Let me ask you this. In the President&#x27;s budget request for \\\\nTSA, you mentioned your relief factor. Not having the relief \\\\nfactor worked in, you needed more people, I think was the \\\\nconversation?\\\\n    When you submit your budget to the President, does it have \\\\nyour relief factor built in? Because that&#x27;s a big number. I \\\\nmean, you are talking about the average for an eight-hour shift \\\\nis like 1.35.\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Sir, the biggest factor in what we submit is, \\\\nand one for us is the formula, how we work the formula to \\\\nfigure out what kind of contingency we want to build in there.\\\\n    It would be a very small percentage, but it does factor out \\\\nin a larger airport, it could factor out to a good number of \\\\npeople. The biggest issue we face oftentimes is volume growth.\\\\n    I mentioned in my opening statement that we saw 12.9 \\\\npercent volume growth, 2023 over 2022. Really, the projections \\\\nwhen the budget was submitted was 4.5 percent.\\\\n    And so you&#x27;re constantly behind in volume growth. The \\\\nchallenge always becomes being able to bring somebody on board, \\\\nget them certified, which is at least a six-month process, so \\\\nthat they can be fully utilized in the checkpoint operation, \\\\nparticularly during the summer months, because that&#x27;s, you \\\\nknow, we&#x27;re busy from 4th of July all the way to the second \\\\nweek in August, busiest except for Thanksgiving, which the day, \\\\nyou know, the Sunday after is generally the most busy day we \\\\never have.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. And last thing, when we were talking about \\\\nVIPR and getting those numbers, BOD deployments, you&#x27;re going \\\\nto roll that up in there too, right?\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. I mean segregate them, but----\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yep.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. You don&#x27;t have any----\\\\n    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir. We&#x27;ll give you every piece of data \\\\nwe have. Thanks.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    So we are going to adjourn the meeting. Obviously, Mr. \\\\nAdministrator, for the questions that Members have had or may \\\\nbe able to submit within the next 5 days or something like \\\\nthat, we are going to go over the calendar a little bit here.\\\\n    It is my intention to try to work session the bills that \\\\nare under our jurisdiction by the end of May. Now, that is \\\\nsubject to Mr. Cole saying, no, you are not. You are going to \\\\ndo it whenever.\\\\n    But short of that, that&#x27;s when we are going to try to do it \\\\nso that we can hopefully be in front of the committee as a \\\\nwhole in June. And the reason that I tell you that, one is full \\\\ndisclosure, and the second one is to the extent that there \\\\nneeds to be any exchange in terms of, hey, we are not sure what \\\\nyour question is, or here is whatever we will be watching that \\\\nnot for, because we need something to do, but it is like we \\\\nwant the Members as fully informed as possible when we say, \\\\nhey, what are you going to do? And what are your ideas and that \\\\nsort of stuff.\\\\n    So I just want to make sure that that is kind of on \\\\neverybody&#x27;s radar screen, if you will. That goes both ways. If \\\\nwhen you and your staff go back after this and go, what in the \\\\nheck was whatever, please reach out so that we can clear that \\\\nup and you are not guessing or just going, I don&#x27;t know. I \\\\ndon&#x27;t know what that guy said, which is why I tried to say very \\\\nlittle, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    Not be the source of those problems. So with that, I want \\\\nto thank you for your professionalism. I enjoyed our ability to \\\\nvisit yesterday and look forward to working with you as we get \\\\nto the end of the process, as far as this.\\\\n    And if there is no further questions and we know about \\\\nsubmitted additional questions, the questions by Members, the \\\\nsubcommittee stands adjourned.\\\\n    [Questions and answers submitted for the record follow:]\\\\n   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n                                         Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\\\\n\\\\nFISCAL YEAR 2025 BUDGET REQUEST FOR IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nPATRICK LECHLEITNER, ACTING DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS \\\\n    ENFORCEMENT\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The subcommittee will come to order. This is \\\\nthe place and time for the meeting to come to order for the \\\\nAppropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s hearing is the fiscal year 2025 budget for the U.S. \\\\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement budget.\\\\n    I don&#x27;t have an opening statement, which I am sure nobody \\\\nwill miss today either.\\\\n    And, with that, I will recognize our ranking member, Mr. \\\\nCuellar, for his opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And I also want to, of course, say welcome to our acting \\\\ndirector for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly \\\\nknown as ICE, and thank you for all the years of service that \\\\nyou have provided. And I want to thank your men and women that \\\\nwork for ICE for the many years of public service and your \\\\nwillingness to lead this multifaceted organization.\\\\n    As you know, this Federal agency is charged with the \\\\nenforcement of violation of customs and immigration laws and, \\\\nagain--but it does a lot more. A lot of people think it is just \\\\nimmigration, but it is a lot more. You also combat cartels and \\\\nother transnational criminal organizations, illicit drug \\\\ntrafficking, including fentanyl, human trafficking, smuggling \\\\nnetworks, and, of course, violation of trade and intellectual \\\\nproperty laws that seek to undermine our economic security.\\\\n    I look forward to discussing with you the present fiscal \\\\nyear 2025 budget request and how this proposal will better \\\\nenable ICE to fulfill its critical national security mission \\\\nand keep our community safe.\\\\n    In particular, I am interested in how the investments in \\\\nhomeland security investigations we secured in this fiscal year \\\\n2024 and what some of the proposed investments for fiscal year \\\\n2025 will increase the government-wide efforts to combat the \\\\nopioid epidemic. And, of course, that is impacting our \\\\ncommunities--small and large communities.\\\\n    We know what has happened with the deaths, especially the \\\\nones from fentanyl, and we want to make sure that we continue \\\\nfighting the criminal organizations and whatever you all can do \\\\nat the southern border and other places also.\\\\n    Also, as I mentioned to the Secretary last week, we are \\\\npleased that we are able to get your resources to increase your \\\\ndetention capacity and maintain important facility oversight to \\\\nmaintain--to better align with what you are seeing along the \\\\nborder.\\\\n    You know, hopefully, if we have a border supplemental--you \\\\nknow, there are some parts out there--but I certainly want to \\\\ntalk to you about that and also talk about expedited removal \\\\nand what legal authorities you may need for those and the \\\\nAlternatives to Detention to ensure the maximum use to get our \\\\nnondetained docket to more manageable levels.\\\\n    Again, there is no shortage of issues that face ICE. We \\\\ncertainly know that, even working with the immigration judges, \\\\nwe need more of your personnel there. But we will save that for \\\\nthe questions.\\\\n    But I want to say thank you. And to the men and women for \\\\nICE, thank you so much for their service.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Mr. Cuellar. And keeping with that \\\\ntheme, you are recognized for the first question.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. What about the 5-minute----\\\\n    You know, I try--I must apologize to you, Mr. Acting \\\\nDirector. I tried to get rid of the opening statement from--who \\\\nwas it yesterday?\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Was it Ohio?\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Pekoske.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Pekoske, yeah. And I keep trying, and it \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know who these people on this dais with \\\\nme are.\\\\n    But, hey, listen, if you would like to do an opening \\\\nstatement, you are by all means welcome to do so now. The floor \\\\nis yours.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Well, thank you, Chair. I appreciate it. \\\\nSo I don&#x27;t know if I would like to, but I will.\\\\n    So good afternoon. I appreciate you having me, and it is my \\\\nhonor to serve the people of ICE and Homeland Security.\\\\n    So, Chairman Amodei, Ranking Member Cuellar, and \\\\ndistinguished Members of the committee, thank you for giving me \\\\nthe opportunity.\\\\n    I am proud to lead the most versatile and agile agency in \\\\nthe Department of Homeland Security, although I may be biased. \\\\nOur operations evolve as new threats arise and, at every turn, \\\\nour workforce adapts to meet those challenges.\\\\n    More than 20,000 ICE personnel work tirelessly to protect \\\\nnational security and promote public safety, including \\\\nthousands of officers and special agents who put their lives on \\\\nthe line every single day to keep us all safe. And I know that \\\\nbecause I was one of them. My highest priority is ensuring the \\\\nICE workforce has the resources they need to fulfill their \\\\nobligations to the American people.\\\\n    I want to thank you for your work on fiscal year 2024 \\\\nConsolidated Appropriations Act--truly thank you--and provide \\\\nthe ICE workforce critical resources, and I am proud to present \\\\nthe fiscal year 2025 budget proposal.\\\\n    The mission of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations or \\\\nERO, as it is known, is to protect the homeland through the \\\\narrest, detention, and removal of noncitizens who undermine the \\\\nsafety of U.S. communities and the integrity of the U.S. \\\\nimmigration system. While ERO&#x27;s immigration enforcement \\\\nauthorities focus in the interior of the United States, \\\\nencounters at the southwest border drive our operations and our \\\\nresource needs, as you are acutely aware.\\\\n    While a noncitizen encountered at the border may be in CBP \\\\ncustody for 72 hours approximately, they may remain on ERO&#x27;s \\\\ndockets for years until provided immigration relief or removal. \\\\nIn addition, ERO continues to provide personnel, logistical \\\\nsupport, and Alternatives to Detention technology to help \\\\nmanage irregular migration at the southwest border.\\\\n    To enforce immigration laws in the interior, ERO officers \\\\nidentify and arrest criminal noncitizens, often with the help \\\\nfrom partner law enforcement agencies, and that is vital. ERO \\\\nofficers also plan and execute small- and large-scale \\\\noperations to arrest at-large criminal noncitizens who threaten \\\\nthe safety of our families, friends, and neighbors.\\\\n    In February-March, ERO officers arrested 491 noncitizens \\\\nconvicted of serious crimes during two nationwide operations. I \\\\ndid some press conferences for these. These individuals were \\\\nconvicted of an array of offenses, including drug trafficking, \\\\nsexual assault, and crimes exploiting children. These \\\\noperations were a tremendous success but are only a small part \\\\nof the work ERO officers do every day to keep our community \\\\nsafe.\\\\n    The bottom line is we have to keep dangerous noncitizens, \\\\nincluding known or suspected terrorists and gang members, off \\\\nour streets.\\\\n    The agency&#x27;s ability to remove individuals to their home \\\\ncountries and detain those who require detention or pose public \\\\nsafety threats is directly dependent on ERO resources, but we \\\\nhave other obligations, too.\\\\n    Homeland Security Investigations or HSI, because of its \\\\nunique authorities and footprint, is the Federal law \\\\nenforcement agency best positioned to investigate and dismantle \\\\ntransnational criminal organizations.\\\\n    HSI has the unique legal authority to conduct Federal \\\\ncriminal investigations into illegal cross-border movement of \\\\npeople, goods, money, technology, and other contraband. HSI is \\\\none of the largest--has one of the largest international \\\\nfootprints in U.S. law enforcement, operating in 55 countries \\\\naround the world. HSI is on the front lines of the war against \\\\nfentanyl and works closely with Federal, State, local, and \\\\nTribal law enforcement partners at home and abroad to fight \\\\nthis horrible opioid epidemic.\\\\n    HSI also combats child exploitation all over the world, \\\\ntakes down poly-crime transnational criminal organizations, as \\\\nwell as bringing down cyber criminals, human traffickers, and \\\\npeople who commit customs or financial fraud.\\\\n    HSI has a huge and transnationally focused mission set, but \\\\nit also has a tremendously talented workforce that includes \\\\nsome of the world&#x27;s best criminal analysts, special agents, and \\\\nsubject matter experts.\\\\n    The funding request in fiscal year 2025 budget supports \\\\nthis tremendous workforce and ensures we are continuing to take \\\\nthe fight to those who profit from exploiting our trade and \\\\nfinancial systems.\\\\n    As global leaders in the fight against transnational \\\\ncriminal organizations, the opioid crisis, and child \\\\nexploitation, we just can&#x27;t afford to fail. Failure would let \\\\ndown the American people who depend on us to keep them safe and \\\\npreserve the integrity of our Nation&#x27;s laws.\\\\n    Ensuring we can fully execute the responsibilities Congress \\\\nhas given us requires appropriate resources, so I respectfully \\\\nsubmit ICE&#x27;s fiscal year 2025 budget request for your \\\\nconsideration.\\\\n    Again, I would like to thank you for allowing me this time \\\\nto speak with you today. I am truly humbled and honored to \\\\nrepresent the men and women of ICE and look forward to \\\\nanswering your questions and providing you the information you \\\\nneed. Thank you.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Director.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar, would it be OK if I called on you now for your \\\\nquestions, or have I disrespected anybody else that was set to \\\\ntestify in the hearing?\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. I will ask the gentlewoman from Ohio if she is \\\\nOK. No, no. That is an inside joke.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Now that we are off to this friendly start, I \\\\nwould like to recognize the ranking member from the Lone Star \\\\nState. Mr. Cuellar, the floor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Mr. Chairman, thank you, again, so much.\\\\n    Mr. Director, as you know, the nondetained docket is upward \\\\nto 7 million individuals and projected to grow to 8 million by \\\\nthe end of the fiscal year.\\\\n    Last week, when we talked to the Secretary, he said that \\\\none of the major provisions of the Senate bipartisan \\\\nlegislation would have been incredibly impactful. If we were to \\\\napply expedited removal proceedings to individuals outside of \\\\nimmigration detention, we would have been able to reduce a 7-\\\\nplus-year asylum process to maybe 90 days.\\\\n    So my question is, is it possible that ICE could consider \\\\ndetain--you know, detain Alternatives to Detention be \\\\nconsidered for expedited removal? Let&#x27;s say, for example, \\\\nprograms like FERM or something like that that could be applied \\\\nbroadly. We are just trying to think outside the box within the \\\\nlegal authorities.\\\\n    And if that is an option, what would the cost be?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Thank you, sir.\\\\n    Yes. We are looking outside the box within ICE and the \\\\nDepartment of Homeland Security to try to figure out how we can \\\\npush down this number and deal with the nondetained numbers.\\\\n    Obviously, we have several population groups within our \\\\ndetained/nondetained population. So we have our detained \\\\npopulation, which are obviously those that are, you know, being \\\\ndetained in a facility, and then we have the nondetained, and \\\\nthat, you know, has the people who are just, you know--have to \\\\nreport at some point. And, also, we have an ATD population in \\\\nthere. So the ATD population is part of that nondetained.\\\\n    We have been working, and FERM is one part of that. It is \\\\nthe Family Expedited Removal process. But it is a very small \\\\nsubset. And what that does is it has been helpful in helping \\\\nremove families.\\\\n    So we are, you know, getting some help in removing the \\\\nfamily units, which are notoriously difficult to do. It is very \\\\ncomplex. We want to make sure we do it properly and judiciously \\\\nin the right way to make sure we protect all those individuals&#x27; \\\\nrights.\\\\n    But moving that into a larger subset of individuals becomes \\\\nnot just more expensive--which it would be--however, it will \\\\ndelay the immigration processes for the rest of the \\\\nindividuals. So the quickest way to expedite--to expeditiously \\\\nremove someone is through the detained docket because, \\\\nobviously, they are there. They are very easy to get to. You \\\\ncan do all the processes and procedures.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Can I interrupt? I am sorry to interrupt you.\\\\n    But the Senate provisions would apply that to nondetained \\\\ndockets, and they said they could probably reduce it from a 7-\\\\nyear wait to a 90-day wait. So you are saying that you need \\\\nresources to do that? I mean, if the Senate deal would have \\\\npassed, then you would have been applying that, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes, absolutely. If the Senate deal would \\\\nhave passed, it would give us some additional resources. In \\\\naddition to resources, it would give us flexibility in some of \\\\nthe rules and procedures and policies.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. So my question again, sir, is--so can you \\\\nconsider somebody on a monitoring system or a check-in to be \\\\npart of the detained population, or do they have to be \\\\nphysically inside of a four-wall place?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. To be part of the detained population, you \\\\nmust be detained. The ATD are considered the nondetained \\\\npopulation. So we could use some efforts such as FERM to apply \\\\nsome expedited removal, but they wouldn&#x27;t be considered part of \\\\nthe detained population.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK. I thought the Secretary was going another \\\\ndirection, but we can follow up.\\\\n    What about the Notice to Appear appointment backlog? The \\\\nlast year&#x27;s prior acting director indicated some locations like \\\\nNew York were backed up to 2033. Where are we today, and what \\\\nare the changes to expedite caseload?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. So, currently, New York--there are \\\\ntwo offices in New York that are backed up. And, actually, I \\\\nbelieve it is 2034. My most recent date on that.\\\\n    The top 10 offices are two in New York. We have Florida, \\\\nIllinois--Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; New Jersey, then \\\\nSan Antonio, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; Baltimore, Maryland; \\\\nand Florida in that order for the longest wait times.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Could you provide us a copy of that?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Yeah. Because I know I got that from last \\\\nyear. I know New York was No. 1. Then it was Miami. And it was, \\\\nlike, 10 years and 9 years. It was just a crazy amount of time.\\\\n    So what do we do to move the needle?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. So we are working several things to move \\\\nthe needle. So we are trying to work some technological \\\\nsolutions so we can allow these individuals--so the noncitizen \\\\nportal, which has recently been rolled out, where noncitizens \\\\ncan check in more easily to take the load off some of the field \\\\noffices. We are trying to allow some other technical \\\\ncapabilities to come into play, and it just takes some time to \\\\ndo so. We are also doing--you know, surging some resources \\\\nthere.\\\\n    But, at the end of the day, sir, you know, we have--give or \\\\ntake--7 million--just over 7 million in the nondetained, and \\\\nthe numbers are continuing. So we only have about 1,100 \\\\nofficers that handle that nondetained and about 4,500 officers \\\\nin total. And if we move officers off of other, like, Fugitive \\\\nOperations or detained, then other things will suffer as well \\\\nin addition to that nondetained process.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. So it sounds like the backlog is going to \\\\nremain?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. It is going to remain for the time being, \\\\nyes.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. To finish this, we added in the fiscal year \\\\n2024 $10 million for additional expedited removal assistance. \\\\nHopefully, that can help you process, and hopefully, you can \\\\nhire those people quickly.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes, absolutely. And we are in the process \\\\nof hiring those individuals and working as quickly as possible \\\\nto get those hired. And some of that money, if we cannot get \\\\nthose people hired by the end of the year--which is a process. \\\\nThey have to get cleared--that money will be used to--as a \\\\nbackfill for some other monies within that program that we \\\\ncannot do.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, thank you so much.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    Next, I would like to recognize the ranking member of the \\\\nHouse Committee on Appropriations. The gentlelady from \\\\nConnecticut, the floor is yours.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you. And let me offer my congratulations \\\\nto you, Mr. Chairman, for taking up the reins of this \\\\nsubcommittee. Delightful to work with you.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, I think.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Yes. Right. Well, that is right. And remind \\\\nme. I have an invitation to you from the Sons and Daughters of \\\\nItaly in May. They want to honor you. So I can&#x27;t forget. I just \\\\nreminded myself. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you so much for being here.\\\\n    Yesterday, at the CJS hearing--Commerce, Justice, Science \\\\nhearing--I asked Attorney General Garland about what I believe \\\\nis a serious blind spot and a lack of resources for the \\\\ninvestigation and prosecution of violations of U.S. trade law, \\\\nand he agreed that fraudulent trade goods pose a serious risk \\\\nto our economy.\\\\n    When fraudulent goods enter the country, it hurts \\\\nconsumers, our trading partners, our domestic manufacturers, \\\\nand it hurts, above all, U.S. workers.\\\\n    He mentioned the Trade Fraud Task Force, and that--if I may \\\\nparaphrase. The difficulty in identifying the fraudulent goods \\\\nas they come in--which, of course, is a homeland security \\\\nissue. And I don&#x27;t think many people know this, but HSI plays a \\\\nhuge role in this space.\\\\n    Can you elaborate on what is in your 2025 request that \\\\nincludes resources to increase your customs and trade \\\\ninvestigations and referrals to DOJ for prosecution, and are \\\\nyou working with the DOJ on their Trade Fraud Task Force?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes, ma&#x27;am. Good afternoon, and pleasure \\\\nto meet you.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. You, too.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes, we are. The simple answer is, yes, we \\\\nare.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. You are working with DOJ?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. We are. We are on those task forces, and \\\\nwe work with them collaboratively to attack this.\\\\n    And as you rightly say, HSI is involved with this effort \\\\nvery robustly. We trace our investigative authorities back \\\\nthrough U.S. customs, which started in 1789, and trade \\\\nenforcement is one of our primary efforts.\\\\n    In addition to the task force that is a DOJ task force, we \\\\nalso have an internal DHS task force between ICE and CBP but \\\\nprimarily HSI and Office of Field Operations and some others \\\\nwithin CBP. That is the Trade Enforcement Coordination Center. \\\\nAnd we also attack it internally through DHS.\\\\n    So we are robustly working with DOJ to work on any kind of \\\\ncriminality and investigations there. We are also working \\\\nwithin DHS. And those two entities and those two efforts are \\\\naligned as well.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. What is the process? How do you move to, you \\\\nknow, identify fraud and fraudulent goods coming in?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Well, how much time do you have, ma&#x27;am?\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Well, not a lot. Not a lot, and I have another \\\\nquestion. But I will just----\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Well, it is good police work and good \\\\ngumshoe investigation. So our partners at CBP are highly \\\\ntrained in identifying where there is fraudulent merchandise, \\\\ncounterfeit, you name it. And then where they see an anomaly, \\\\nthey will try and identify what it is, and if they identify \\\\nsomething that truly looks like it is an anomaly and requires \\\\nfurther investigation, then they call in HSI. And we will help \\\\nthem and we will take that investigation further, and it will \\\\ngo either criminal or administrative, depending on the nature \\\\nof the violation.\\\\n    But, as you rightly say, it is not an easy thing. These \\\\nthings are secreted, and these criminal organizations or \\\\nindividuals are doing everything they can to smuggle them in. \\\\nAnd it could be any number of things that they are doing, and \\\\nit is in their best interest to make it as hard as possible for \\\\nour abilities to detect.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Have you put in a substantial amount for \\\\nresources in the budget for this area?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. We have put some--there is some money in \\\\nthe budget for this, and we have resources going to support \\\\ndomestic operations, which is where this would fall--a \\\\nsubstantial amount in the 2025 budget--and we also work, you \\\\nknow, collaboratively with CBP on all of this.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. I am going to try for another question before \\\\nthey cut me off here.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. OK. Gotcha.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Since 2019, a substantial increase in child \\\\nlabor violations. Many of these kids come from vulnerable \\\\nbackgrounds. They work long hours for little to no pay, \\\\nfrequently abused, and deprived of any chance to play or go to \\\\nschool.\\\\n    I am a proud sponsor of the Children Harmed in Life-\\\\nThreatening Or Dangerous (CHILD) Labor Act, which would \\\\nstrengthen our Federal child labor laws and hold companies that \\\\nexploit the labor of children accountable. HSI also plays a key \\\\nrole here by combating the illegal importation of goods \\\\npurchased through illegal labor practices, including forced \\\\nlabor or child labor.\\\\n    How does your budget request propose to continue or bolster \\\\nefforts to look to our borders and beyond to investigate and \\\\nrescue victims of child labor practices? Amidst investigating \\\\nmany times of illegal labor practices, can you speak to how HSI \\\\nis addressing the issue of illegal child labor specifically?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. Certainly, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    So HSI has been doing this and concentrates heavily here. \\\\nWe have asked for just over 10 million and almost $11 million \\\\nfor the Center to Counter Human Trafficking, which supports all \\\\nof these efforts from a DHS-wide center, and we are the \\\\nexecutive agent and lead that effort there.\\\\n    Also, there are additional budget monies in there to pull \\\\nover from monies from the Blue Campaign--which is related to \\\\nthis--to combat it. We also have the Uyghur Force Labor \\\\nPrevention Act that provides--that is providing positions and \\\\nmonies to attack these efforts.\\\\n    In addition to those efforts, we also have--in addition to \\\\nthe CCHT, we have, within HSI, our Transnational Criminal \\\\nInvestigative Division, and we go after these--this criminality \\\\nin conjunction with Department of Labor and Department of \\\\nJustice and Health and Human Services.\\\\n    So we have to do this--we have to do this together because \\\\nnone of us have all of the pieces, and we also have to work \\\\nwith our State and local counterparts because, very often, \\\\nwhere these children are employed and working, it is not \\\\nnecessarily transparent that there is a victimization going on, \\\\nand sometimes they are hidden in plain sight. So we have to \\\\nwork very proactively and jointly with our State, local, \\\\nFederal partners.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. I would love to follow up with you because I \\\\nthink some of these bad actors who are doing this--we have to \\\\nfigure out how they can be stopped. What are the kinds of \\\\naction that we can take against these businesses that are doing \\\\nthis? And, obviously, that includes yourself and DOJ and \\\\nDepartment of Labor.\\\\n    So I would love to continue this conversation offline. So \\\\nthank you very much.\\\\n    Thank you for your gracious indulgence. I appreciate it. \\\\nThanks.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Rutherford, the \\\\nfloor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And, Director, thank you very much for your service. Thank \\\\nyou to your staff as well. I really appreciate that you guys \\\\nare so forthcoming with answers and information, even in \\\\npreparation for this meeting. So thank you very much for that.\\\\n    I want to go back a minute to talk about the nondetained \\\\ndocket and the detained docket, actually, because when people \\\\nlook at the EROs and who is being deported, you know, we had--\\\\nlast year, ICE deported 142,580.\\\\n    Now, I know from having spoken with you that there are some \\\\nissues that stop us from--and make those deportations \\\\ndifficult. That is why when Mr. Cuellar was talking earlier \\\\nabout some of these deportations and how we can expedite that.\\\\n    Can you talk just for a minute and can you give us a list \\\\nof the countries that give you a hard time or just completely \\\\nresist taking these folks back?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes, absolutely. Thank you, sir. I \\\\nappreciate the question.\\\\n    It is a complex procedure. So not only are these \\\\nindividuals encountered in--you know, primarily by CBP, and \\\\nthen they are turned over to ICE, and we have them through the \\\\nlifecycle of the civil immigration procedures, but if they are \\\\na threat to national security or public safety, they are going \\\\nto be detained.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Sure.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Otherwise, they would move on to the \\\\nnondetained status. And depending on where we are at with our \\\\nthreat vector, they will potentially have some Alternatives to \\\\nDetention. So they won&#x27;t be detained, but they will be there as \\\\na subset of the nondetained.\\\\n    But it is not easy sometimes to remove these individuals, \\\\nas you might imagine. You just can&#x27;t turn them over. You are \\\\ngoing to have to work.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. So how much help do you get, Director, in \\\\npressuring through the State Department or the President to get \\\\nthese people to take their own people back? How much help do we \\\\nget there?\\\\n    And, while you are thinking about it, can you actually give \\\\nme a list of those countries that are most difficult to deal \\\\nwith?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Oh, certainly. Yes. So I will start with \\\\nthe second part first.\\\\n    We have got Bhutan, top of the list there. Cambodia, they \\\\nhave been challenging. The People&#x27;s Republic of China, although \\\\nwe have had some recent cautiously optimistic progress with the \\\\nChinese. So I want to say that it is moving in the right \\\\ndirection there.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Can you just provide us that list?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. I would be happy to.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you. And the other part.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. And the other part is we are working \\\\ncollaboratively with the Department of Homeland Security writ \\\\nlarge and the State Department. And I must say that, throughout \\\\nthe Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, \\\\nthey are very forward-leaning in trying to rectify any of these \\\\nrecalcitrant countries, but there are a lot of geopolitical \\\\nissues that do not revolve around the immigration and removal, \\\\nand it is not an easy issue for them either.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. All right. And kind of following up on \\\\nthat, knowing that we have 1.2 million who already have their \\\\nremoval orders issued and they are in every community in \\\\nAmerica--I know many law enforcement agencies like mine have a \\\\n287(g) program which allows them to work through ICE to \\\\nidentify these folks when they are incarcerated, and then we \\\\nexpedite getting them out--again, going back to Mr. Cuellar&#x27;s \\\\npoint about expediting--we can expedite that, and ICE simply \\\\nneeds to come and pick them up. We put detainers on them, and \\\\nthey come and pick them up, and then they deport them.\\\\n    So Tae Johnson said, you know, it is the best thing since \\\\nsliced bread, this program. I tried to ask Secretary Mayorkas \\\\nif he would make a commitment to expanding this program that is \\\\nbetter than sliced bread. I couldn&#x27;t get an answer.\\\\n    Can you tell me what you think about the 287(g) program, \\\\nand should we be looking at expansion?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Well, sir, I must say, I am not as \\\\narticulate or as funny as Mr. Johnson. So I do miss him.\\\\n    However, in my experience, a well-run and properly overseen \\\\n287(g) program is useful. It helps us partner with State and \\\\nlocal law enforcement. It is one tool in a large tool bag that \\\\nwe have, but I must say, I like every opportunity to partner \\\\nwith State and local law enforcement, and any chance I can do \\\\nit, I will.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you.\\\\n    And I see, Mr. Chairman, my time has burned up, so I yield \\\\nback.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, sir.\\\\n    The floor now goes to the representative from Illinois, Ms. \\\\nUnderwood. You may proceed.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Good afternoon, Acting Director Lechleitner. It is so good \\\\nto see you today.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Good to see you.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. ICE plays a critical role in enforcing our \\\\nNation&#x27;s immigration laws, and the work done at ICE is \\\\nimportant and should align with American values as well as our \\\\nsecurity priorities.\\\\n    ICE&#x27;s Health Service Corps is tasked with providing direct \\\\nand indirect healthcare services to detained noncitizens in ICE \\\\ncustody. This may include anything from the simple, like \\\\nadministration of a flu shot, to the complex, like pregnancy \\\\nand delivery.\\\\n    As you know, ICE has a legal and moral responsibility to \\\\nensure any health services it provides to those in custody meet \\\\nsome baseline standards, and when receiving those services, the \\\\npatient&#x27;s national identity, race, gender, socioeconomic \\\\nstatus, or ability to communicate in English should never \\\\ndetermine whether they receive quality care. So I was concerned \\\\nto see earlier this year ICE has failed to meet basic standards \\\\nwhen delivering health services.\\\\n    According to a report issued this year by the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security&#x27;s inspector general, ICE failed to follow \\\\nsome of its own policies between 2019 and 2021 when authorizing \\\\nmedical surgeries for detained noncitizens. This failure \\\\nresulted in nearly one-third of medical procedures performed on \\\\nimmigrants in ICE custody being improperly authorized.\\\\n    According to the OIG&#x27;s report, there were at least two \\\\nwomen given hysterectomies when there was no documentation to \\\\nsupport that this surgery was medically necessary.\\\\n    Director Lechleitner--OK.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Absolutely.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Hysterectomies are irreversible. Once it is \\\\ndone, a woman cannot have children. It is a surgery that shapes \\\\nher life, and it should not be performed without her consent \\\\nand proof of medical necessity.\\\\n    I do understand that ICE has accepted the findings of the \\\\nOIG report, and that is an important start. However, today, I \\\\nwould like to hear more about the specific changes that are \\\\nbeing implemented now in order to improve the administration of \\\\nhealth services to migrants in ICE custody in response to this \\\\nreport.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. Thank you, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Yes. When I became aware of that, it is unacceptable. It is \\\\nunacceptable that we are not providing the utmost healthcare \\\\nfor those that are in our charge and we are responsible for. As \\\\nICE, we are not happy to see that at all from the standpoint of \\\\nthe leadership, and we concurred with those responses, and we \\\\nare working diligently to address them.\\\\n    So it is of our, you know, primary effort to make sure \\\\nthose in our charge are treated humanely and we are \\\\nefficiently, you know, taking care of their medical situation \\\\nas appropriately as possible.\\\\n    I must say, our Health Corps is very good, and we are going \\\\nto ensure that we are in compliance with all the policies and \\\\nprocedures, and moving forward, we are going to ensure this \\\\nnever happens again.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Yes, sir. I don&#x27;t need to tell you the long \\\\nand troubled history of forced sterilization in this country, \\\\nespecially on women of color, and hysterectomies should never \\\\nbe performed without fully informed consent.\\\\n    What is ICE doing to explicitly ensure that no woman in \\\\ncustody undergoes a hysterectomy without consent and medical \\\\nneed again, and does the agency have a plan to revisit gaps in \\\\nits policy specifically concerning reproductive healthcare?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. We are revisiting all of those, and \\\\nwe are working with the Department of Homeland Security Chief \\\\nMedical Officer&#x27;s office to look at it all and make sure we do \\\\nnot repeat any of these problems.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. OK. Excellent.\\\\n    Well, the CMO is--it is in partnership, or do you--because \\\\nICE Health Corps does not report to the CMO&#x27;s office.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. No, it is in partnership.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. OK. What about maternal healthcare? Can you \\\\nshare an update on the work ICE is doing to keep pregnant women \\\\nin custody and their babies safe and healthy?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. It is similar. We are making sure \\\\nthat we ensure that mothers and--you know, either pregnant or \\\\nwith recent children--are provided the utmost healthcare and \\\\nthat they are properly taken care of in the conditions that are \\\\nappropriate for them in the facilities.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. In policies and in practice?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. OK. Thank you. I hope that we can continue \\\\nto stay engaged on this issue and ensure that ICE is treating \\\\nit as a priority.\\\\n    Many of us who are lucky enough to be born in the United \\\\nStates may never fully understand the journey that some new \\\\nAmericans have taken to get here, and the encounters that \\\\nimmigrants have with ICE shape America&#x27;s global image and \\\\ncommunities across the world in immeasurable ways. We have a \\\\nresponsibility to uphold our values as Americans in every \\\\nsingle way.\\\\n    Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Thank you, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Washington, Mr. Newhouse, \\\\nthe floor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Acting Director, thanks for being with us, sir, and I would \\\\nalso like to, through you, extend my thanks to the agents and \\\\nofficers and analysts, attorneys, everybody that works under \\\\nyou for the hard work that they do to mitigate transnational \\\\nthreats and keep our community safe, and I appreciate the hard \\\\nwork, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. On the subject of detention beds, the fiscal \\\\nyear 2025 budget request includes 34,000 detention beds. That \\\\nis a level to the detention capacity provided in fiscal years \\\\n2021 through 2023 but a drop from last year&#x27;s enacted level of \\\\n41,500.\\\\n    So I see that you are an experienced law enforcement \\\\nofficer. You have a long career in that. What, in your opinion, \\\\nis the appropriate level of detention beds?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Thank you. Good question.\\\\n    The appropriate level does fluctuate. We are kind of driven \\\\nby demand at the border, and then that intake will drive our \\\\nnumbers.\\\\n    You are correct. For fiscal year 2024, which we are \\\\ncurrently in, we have 41,500, but that was recently enacted. \\\\nWhen we were building the budget request for fiscal year 2025, \\\\nwe were operating under a continuing resolution from 2023, \\\\nwhich is at 2025. So we actually went up 9--I know this is a \\\\nlittle convoluted. And I didn&#x27;t like the way this was done, but \\\\nwe don&#x27;t get to make the rules. It went up 9,000 from 2023 to \\\\n2025, but luckily, we were taken care of in a meaningful way \\\\nfor the fiscal year 2024 that hit in March at 41,500.\\\\n    However, saying that, we have a contingency fund for the \\\\nDepartment of Homeland Security that allows me instant access. \\\\nI have been assured that. It is not the design I would want. I \\\\nhave been assured, though, that I have access to monies if \\\\nneeded to plus-up those bed numbers to a level where it is \\\\nrequired.\\\\n    Currently, we are right around--35,000 is where we are \\\\nsitting right now, but that has been higher. It only recently \\\\nwas reduced. And we are, you know, trying to get ready for some \\\\nspring/summer flows, and, you know, we have to be flexible to \\\\nbe able to do that. But I am assured that that 34-number plus \\\\nthe contingency fund will allow us the ability to operate in \\\\n2025.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. So somewhere in the 40,000 range probably?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Currently, although given some of the \\\\nflows that were occurring last year, honestly, I would like to \\\\nsee the number closer to 50-, as the Secretary mentioned.\\\\n    But, you know, we have a top line within the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security, and we have to, you know, work within our \\\\nbudget. And he said it better than I, but, you know, I believe \\\\nthat we will have the resources required to use detention as \\\\nnecessary.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. So the nondetained docket has more than \\\\ndoubled under this administration to include 7.1 million \\\\nmigrants. This not only includes the 1.3 million that have \\\\nfinal orders of removal, but at least 617,000 illegal \\\\nimmigrants with criminal convictions or pending criminal \\\\ncharges who essentially are out on American streets right now \\\\nfree, if they would like, to reoffend.\\\\n    How does ICE prioritize migrants from the detained docket \\\\nversus the nondetained docket, especially considering some of \\\\nthe recent news stories that we have heard of heinous crimes \\\\nbeing committed by those who are here illegally?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. So we prioritize both--we have to--\\\\nbut we are driven by flows that come off the border.\\\\n    So over the last some quite bit of time, we have had \\\\nsupport going down to CBP on the southern border. So we have \\\\nhad ERO and HSI personnel--but, in this instance, it is \\\\nimportant to focus on ERO--that are assisting because of the \\\\nborder management and making sure that we decompress areas and \\\\nwe are being pulled. So it is pulling us away from our interior \\\\ncore of line business.\\\\n    So where we would normally have Fugitive Ops teams going \\\\nout to try and pick up some of these individuals who were on \\\\nthe nondetained docket and amenable, we have to make decisions \\\\nand move people around where it is the biggest pain point at a \\\\ngiven period of time. So although we are not purely at the \\\\nborder, we are driven by some of those flows at the border, and \\\\nwe have to help CBP. So that is part of this.\\\\n    The other part of this----\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. So you are saying, as the flow increases, the \\\\nbar essentially lowers?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Not the bar lowers, but as the flow \\\\nincreases, our personnel get pulled. So we are getting pulled \\\\nto assist, and we just don&#x27;t have as many personnel to go out \\\\nto pick up at-large individuals.\\\\n    Also, in noncooperative jurisdictions, very often, we do \\\\nnot have the necessary support from State and locals where it \\\\nmakes it even more difficult for us to locate and apprehend \\\\nthese individuals. So it takes a lot longer.\\\\n    It is much easier to remove someone who is in detention \\\\nwhere you know where they are at and you have all that \\\\ninformation and it is much more orderly. Where you have someone \\\\nin the community, depending on the circumstances, it is very \\\\ncomplex, it is much more dangerous, and it takes much, much \\\\nlonger.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate that. Thank you for your \\\\nresponses.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentleman from Maryland, despite our discussion off the \\\\nrecord where I said I wasn&#x27;t going to call on you, and you \\\\nsaid, well, that is OK because I am going to talk anyhow, we \\\\nwould like your comments on the record. You are recognized. The \\\\nfloor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Well, I want to thank the chair very much for \\\\nthat consideration.\\\\n    Hi. Thank you very much for appearing before the \\\\nsubcommittee and for doing an important job.\\\\n    The first question I am going to ask you is about the \\\\n287(g) program because the Secretary somehow didn&#x27;t know \\\\nwhether or not there were more or less, you know, local \\\\njurisdictions who are part of the 287. He didn&#x27;t know whether \\\\nthere was a trend in decreasing or increasing. Maybe you know. \\\\nI mean, I thought the Secretary should know that, but maybe you \\\\nknow.\\\\n    What is the trend in 287(g) cooperation?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Good afternoon. Thank you for having me.\\\\n    It has been under review and on hold since early 2021. So \\\\nthere has been no new agreements since the end of 2020.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Right. How many have been ended since then?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. The most recent--I take that--I have to \\\\ntake that as a get-back to see how many have ended in those 3 \\\\nyears, but the latest ending was at the end of 2023, I believe.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Right. So when the Secretary came in----\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. 2022.\\\\n    Mr. Harris [continuing]. And said he is doing everything he \\\\ncan to keep our communities safe, I take it that it was this \\\\nadministration that basically ended the program.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. It has been on hold since the beginning \\\\nof----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. It has been on hold.\\\\n    So I don&#x27;t understand. Can you explain to me how that \\\\nprotects communities by extending new agreements under the \\\\n287(g)?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. No, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK. I didn&#x27;t think you could because it is \\\\nintuitive and obvious to anyone who thinks about it. That, \\\\nobviously, if you care about protecting communities, 287(g) is \\\\na valuable tool, and this administration doesn&#x27;t want to use a \\\\nvaluable tool. OK. I get it. I think the Secretary should have \\\\nknown that, but----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. It is better than sliced bread.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Right. Look, I don&#x27;t get it.\\\\n    Anyway, in the ERO part of the--I had a question because it \\\\nsaid in your testimony here that commercial and charter flight \\\\nservices continue to increase. Now, why is that? My impression \\\\nwas that we are not deporting as many people. Well, we deport--\\\\nit is about the same number, I guess.\\\\n    So are these the flights that transport people into the \\\\ninterior from the border?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. No, sir. No. These are decompression \\\\nflights moving people from one part of the border to another. \\\\nThese are not interior flights. We haven&#x27;t ever removed anyone \\\\nto the interior.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK. So that is another agency that does--\\\\nanother branch of the agency does the interior flights.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. No. I am not aware----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Who is chartering the midnight nights? That is \\\\nall I want to know.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. It is not us.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK. Good. Good. Because we can&#x27;t even get \\\\nanswers about, you know, when these midnight flights arrive, \\\\nyou know, notification that they are sending them into your \\\\ndistrict, things like this that a Member of Congress probably \\\\nought to know.\\\\n    So you are decompressing to other detention facilities, to \\\\nother processing facilities. You know, when we were down at Del \\\\nRio, I mean, we were there a couple weeks after that 8,000 \\\\npeople in one day.\\\\n    So what is the decompression? Is it for people who have \\\\nalready gone through the CBP process? What is the \\\\ndecompression?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yeah. It could be a little bit of the \\\\nabove. So, like, if Arizona is seeing surges, as an example, \\\\nand they are getting overrun and they just don&#x27;t have the \\\\ncapacity there to deal with that, we may help with CBP and move \\\\nthose individuals through decompression maybe into Texas or, \\\\nyou know, other parts of the border. So back and forth and move \\\\nindividuals around the different detention centers or areas \\\\nwhere we can have more capacity to deal with the numbers.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK. And I imagine, as these numbers increased \\\\nin the last fiscal year of people who are--you know, need to be \\\\nprocessed, that is the reason why these flights, I guess, have \\\\ngone up, I imagine. Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. The decompression? OK.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK. In the last brief period of time I have, I \\\\nam going to discuss a problem in Maryland because there are \\\\ncounties in Maryland--like Montgomery County just to the north \\\\nof here--where the county executive strangely claims that they \\\\nare not a sanctuary county, but according to a story on \\\\nFebruary 28, ICE has issued 119 detainers in fiscal year 2024 \\\\nin the county, and ICE says none of those have been honored.\\\\n    Is that true, to the best of your knowledge? In Montgomery \\\\nCounty, MD, ICE has correctly issued 119 detainers and none \\\\nhave been honored as of February?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. That specifically, I don&#x27;t know. I will \\\\nhave to get--take that back.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. If you can get back to me and confirm whether \\\\nthat is true or not because I am reading it in a press report, \\\\nand goodness knows you can&#x27;t always trust a press report.\\\\n    But, that being said, there were two fairly high-profile \\\\ncases in Montgomery County where detainers were issued where, \\\\nin one case, the detainee was subsequently arrested for being \\\\npart of a murder of a 2-year old, as I recall, and then another \\\\none with another violent crime.\\\\n    And, fortunately, because I just looked at the ICE \\\\nwebsite--I think it might even be today or yesterday--there was \\\\na press release about how ICE has, in fact, despite the best \\\\nefforts of Montgomery County to let this person prey upon \\\\nMarylanders, ICE has arrested that Salvadorian and detained \\\\nthem.\\\\n    So congratulations for doing it despite the best efforts of \\\\nsome of our--and I put in air quotes--leaders in Maryland who \\\\ncontinue to make these jurisdictions--who brag about these \\\\njurisdictions as sanctuary jurisdictions and turn a blind eye \\\\nto the crime problem that you and your agency are trying to \\\\nsolve.\\\\n    So thank you very much for your service.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from ``Ohiowa&#x27;&#x27; for \\\\n5 minutes. The floor is yours.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. We will call ourself Iowegians today. That \\\\nsounds great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Acting Director Lechleitner, for appearing \\\\nbefore us today.\\\\n    I wanted to start off by kind of echoing some of my \\\\ncolleagues&#x27; comments. I think it is disappointing to see \\\\nPresident Biden and Secretary Mayorkas asking, again, for the \\\\ncontingency--we call it slush fund--again this year. I thought \\\\nwe made it pretty clear in our fiscal year 2024 appropriations \\\\nprocess that we do not see this as a feasible solution to \\\\naddressing surges at the border.\\\\n    I mean, you talked about the beds and your assurances \\\\nthere, but does it take some time to prop up these beds? I \\\\nmean, you can&#x27;t just snap your fingers and have beds ready to \\\\ngo to handle a surge of migrants at the southern border. I \\\\nmean, you are talking about flying them from State to State at \\\\na huge taxpayer expense.\\\\n    How quickly can you turn these beds around when you have a \\\\nsurge situation?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Well, we have a certain number of, you \\\\nknow, government, you know, minimum beds. We call them GM beds \\\\nwhere we all--we are paying for a certain amount we have all \\\\nthe time, and right now, our utilization of those beds is about \\\\n85 percent. But it is the extra beds where we get--that is \\\\nwhere we are talking about the surge beds, if you will.\\\\n    And I am less--I would like to have more money dedicated \\\\nand appropriated for the beds personally, but I----\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. So you would rather have the beds in your \\\\nbottom line rather than have to rely on this surge funding?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Personally, yes.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. OK. That is important to know. And I heard you \\\\nmention that 50,000 number. Is that where you would like that \\\\nnumber to really be?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. We think that that is more \\\\nappropriate.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. OK. I want to follow up on something my \\\\ncolleague, Mr. Harris, just mentioned. He brought up \\\\nspecifically the challenges in enforcement at the local level \\\\nin Maryland, and I know that is something you face around the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    Many of the jurisdictions that you mentioned earlier--\\\\nFlorida, Illinois, New York--I am sure New York, Illinois, I \\\\ncan see here probably New Jersey, Baltimore--are some of the \\\\nplaces that you face many of the challenges in enforcement.\\\\n    So how do sanctuary cities impact your enforcement efforts? \\\\nWhen they are refusing to cooperate at the local level of those \\\\njurisdictions, how are you working to ensure the safety and \\\\nsecurity of those communities while still working to apprehend \\\\nthese violent criminals?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. Good question. Thank you, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Listen, as you know, I am a career police officer. This is \\\\nwhat I have done for my whole career. And I will always work \\\\nand engage and have dialogue with State and local partners. \\\\nThat is where I started. We want to work together, and we want \\\\nto protect public safety and national security.\\\\n    And in those jurisdictions where they are prohibited from \\\\ndealing with us, we are going to have to do it ourselves and \\\\nhave to do a more--a lot of at-large or, in the communities, \\\\nFugitive Operations, if you will. And those are much more time-\\\\nconsuming, resource-draining, and dangerous. But we do them \\\\nbecause we have to uphold the law and public safety and \\\\nnational security.\\\\n    We would much prefer to have a good dialogue and have \\\\nassistance from our State and local partners, but regardless, \\\\nwe are going to execute our mission and uphold the law.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Do you know how many detainers you have issued \\\\nthat you have not had cooperation or response with nationwide?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Not off the top of my head, but I will get \\\\nyou that.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. OK. I would appreciate the breakdown there.\\\\n    And then you mentioned the ability to work with local law \\\\nenforcement, and I certainly appreciate that. Thank you for the \\\\nwork you have done to keep your communities--and I work \\\\ndirectly with our local law enforcement all the time. They are \\\\ngreat out on the front lines, but we know they are facing \\\\nuphill battles in our communities, too.\\\\n    So is there strong coordination in those instances? How do \\\\nyou develop those relationships and work around some of these \\\\nsanctuary cities?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. So we do generally--we can work--on \\\\ncivil immigration, it can be very problematic depending on the \\\\njurisdiction we are dealing with, and we do the best we can to \\\\nwork with them. And my guidance to our personnel is do not let \\\\nthe perfect be the enemy of good, and find a way to work with \\\\nState and local counterparts wherever we can.\\\\n    And as it relates to, you know, criminality and \\\\ninvestigations that are beyond the scope of the civil \\\\nimmigration, we have had much more success in these \\\\njurisdictions. And, you know, quite frankly, I am very pleased \\\\nwith the amount of cooperation and relationships we have in \\\\nthat venue, specifically for HSI.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. OK. Yeah. And if you would follow up--I would \\\\nappreciate you following up with that information on the \\\\ndetainers nationwide.\\\\n    How are you working to use HSI agents to better keep track \\\\nof individuals that have committed crimes in communities and \\\\nmake sure that they are being apprehended? I think there is a \\\\ngrowing frustration from people watching people who are here \\\\nillegally commit crimes, even assaulting law enforcement \\\\nofficers, and being released into our communities. I think \\\\ncrime of all levels should be considered a removable offense.\\\\n    So is that a barrier, you know, in terms of sanctuary \\\\ncities placing the protections on those individuals? Is it \\\\nprosecutors not prosecuting? What, in your mind, is the problem \\\\nhere that we need to be addressing?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Well, that would fall under our ERO side \\\\nof the house and the Fugitive Operations going after criminal \\\\naliens, as we know.\\\\n    So we have gotten some more money in the 2025 budget as a \\\\nrequest. So that will help a little bit. We have some Fugitive \\\\nOperations money in there and some criminal apprehension \\\\nprograms. So that is going out and getting these criminals. And \\\\nthat is where we are trying to partner more and more if we can \\\\nwith State and locals and do what we can to pull as many of \\\\nthese individuals into custody.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. All right. Well, I see my time has expired. \\\\nThank you, Acting Director.\\\\n    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Thank you, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentleman from Texas is recognized for questions. The \\\\nfloor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you, Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you for being here, and thank you for the work \\\\nthat you are doing to protect our country.\\\\n    How many migrants are you monitoring--is ICE monitoring at \\\\nthe time being?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. The whole population?\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. So, you know, we have about 35,000--today, \\\\nwe have about 35,000 approximately in custody. We have about, \\\\ngive or take, 190,000 on Alternatives to Detention, and that is \\\\na subset of the nondetained which is over 7 million.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. OK. And how many migrants have a criminal record \\\\nthat are in our country at the moment?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. I will take that as a get-back. I don&#x27;t \\\\nknow exactly how many off the top of my head.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. We have a number that is over 300,000.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. That comports correctly of the \\\\nnondetained.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. What steps does ICE take to verify whether \\\\nmigrants have a criminal record or not?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. There are a couple steps. So if these \\\\nindividuals are encountered at the border or at the port of \\\\nentry, CBP would do a check on them and run the check and see \\\\nif there is any record there.\\\\n    Within about 72 hours, they are going to be turned over to \\\\nICE custody for determination on detention or nondetained \\\\nstatus or Alternatives to Detention, and then we run a second \\\\ncheck at that point to make sure that--we just double-check to \\\\nmake sure whatever criminality exists.\\\\n    In many cases, you know, there is going to be nothing. And \\\\nin some cases, the criminality would actually pop up later on \\\\nwhere we weren&#x27;t aware of it at a given time.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Well, first of all, by criminal activity, we are \\\\nexcluding actually crossing the border illegally.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. That&#x27;s correct, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. So when they come to the border, they are in CBP \\\\ncustody. Many of them are not presenting identification. We are \\\\nkind of just taking their word for it. Obviously, someone who \\\\nhas a criminal history is not likely to show documentation.\\\\n    How is ICE dealing with this? Does ICE have the capability \\\\nto deal with this?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. So we use any and all information we have \\\\nat the time. I can&#x27;t speak for CBP&#x27;s method of vetting and \\\\nscreening.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Right. But you are basically confirming CBP&#x27;s \\\\ndata?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. We are doing our own double--we are just \\\\ndouble-checking on everything. And we do our own. It is \\\\nseparate.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. And then we are doing biometrics. We are \\\\ndoing everything we can to determine, you know, what we can.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. So if we know there are 300,000 criminal aliens, \\\\nit is likely substantially higher. I mean, I have been down to \\\\nthe border. A lot of them drop their IDs at the border and \\\\ndon&#x27;t bring them across. You know, if you look at them when \\\\nthey are vetting the process--you know, they ask them their \\\\nname, they ask them how old they are, they ask--right? But they \\\\nare just taking their word for it.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. A lot of the criminal aliens that are \\\\nreferenced in that number in the nondetained--a lot of those \\\\nindividuals--you know, they have committed some kind of \\\\ncriminal act while they are here as well that it was after the \\\\nfact that they were encountered.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. OK. I wanted to bring up 287(g). A lot has been \\\\nsaid about that today already, but 10 of my 14 counties are a \\\\npart of the program. Others would like to join, but we have \\\\nseen that the Biden administration has put a pause in new \\\\napplications. I am just curious as to why.\\\\n    You admit that it is a valuable tool. A number of the law \\\\nenforcement organizations throughout certainly south Texas \\\\nwould love to be a part. Any reason why this is a \\\\ncongressionally mandated program and why that policy is \\\\nignored?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. I can&#x27;t answer for the Biden \\\\nadministration, honestly. I can say that a well-run, properly \\\\noverseen program is effective and a good tool that we have to \\\\nwork with our State and local partners. It is not the only \\\\ntool, but it is a good tool, and I found it to be effective.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. When looking at the budget--and so in fiscal \\\\nyear 2018, the agency budget was about $7.4 billion. The agency \\\\nremoved 256,805 illegal aliens. If we look at fiscal year 2022, \\\\nthe budget was over a billion higher. 72,177 illegal aliens \\\\nwere removed.\\\\n    I realize that is not the only thing that you are doing, \\\\nbut there is not necessarily a direct correlation but certainly \\\\na correlation between increased budget and less illegal alien \\\\nremoval. Can you square that for us and tell us what is going \\\\non there?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Yes. Well, for quite a while from COVID up \\\\nuntil May 2023, we were also conducting title 42 operations \\\\nwhere those people were being expelled. So the actual removal \\\\nnumbers don&#x27;t count all of the expulsions that were in there as \\\\nwell. So when you combine those numbers, it is higher than just \\\\nthe removal numbers.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. OK. But the last years are not--certainly not \\\\nwhat they were 5 years ago?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. No. Yes, they are lower.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. OK. One more question, and this has to do with \\\\nEndeavors contracting. I believe you know Endeavors.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. I do, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. A no-bid contract, $80 million made by--\\\\nbasically, an Obama transition team official left, went to be \\\\non the board for Endeavors. Not only was it a no-bid contract, \\\\nit was an unsolicited contract, and then that basically was \\\\nrepeated with HHS.\\\\n    Can you talk to us about what you are doing? And then, you \\\\nknow, we can get into what happened with that contract. You \\\\nknow, there has been reports about how that money was spent. It \\\\nwas very wasteful. Hotel rooms that were never used and the \\\\nlike. A lot of mismanagement going on here and certainly a lot \\\\nof circumspect on how these contracts are being awarded.\\\\n    Could you speak to what you are doing to clean up the no-\\\\nbid contract processing?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. So, regarding that, we did a review, and \\\\nall appropriate career folks that were in acquisition and in \\\\nthe process had eyes on that. We----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. That is not sufficient for me to say that there \\\\nwas no impropriety.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. No, no. No, sir. I am saying that we are \\\\nlooking at everything to make sure there is no--there is \\\\nnothing that could be even perceived to be improper.\\\\n    The individual--you know, there was a memo that was written \\\\nabout who was going to have oversight and what kind of policy \\\\nand procedure we were going to have within the agency. That was \\\\ncorrected and changed.\\\\n    And we have full oversight on how we are doing this \\\\ninternally. I would be happy to follow up offline and get you \\\\nour policies and procedures as it relates to that.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Thank you. I appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Guest, is \\\\nrecognized. The floor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Director, thank you for coming in earlier this week and \\\\nvisiting with me and my staff in preparation for the hearing. I \\\\nam going to ask you some of the questions that we spoke of when \\\\nyou were in the office.\\\\n    First--and I know that Mrs. Hinson mentioned it earlier--\\\\ndetention beds. We know that, currently under the fiscal year \\\\n2024 budget, the Congress has appropriated funding for 41,500 \\\\ndetention beds. The Secretary was testifying last week before \\\\nthis very committee. He testified before us that he felt like \\\\nthe Senate request of 50,000 beds that was in the negotiations \\\\nin the Senate--that he supported a 50,000-bed request.\\\\n    In our conversation that we had--and I am not trying to \\\\nmischaracterize that--I believe that you said you would also \\\\nsupport a 50,000-bed request. But the request that we received \\\\nfrom Congress is not a 50,000-bed request, which would have \\\\nbeen an increase from fiscal year 2024, but it is actually a \\\\nsubstantial decrease of 7,500 beds down to 34,000.\\\\n    And so is it safe to say that a 34,000-bed request would be \\\\ninsufficient to meet the needs of your agency?\\\\n    Mr. Guest. And I want to look at that in relation to \\\\nsomething else we have talked about, which is the nondetention \\\\ndocket.\\\\n    In your annual report, ICE annual report that you and I \\\\nwent over a little bit, we talked about the fact that at the \\\\nend of fiscal year 2023 that the nondetained docket had \\\\napproached roughly 6.2 million individuals who were in the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    During our conversation, you said you believe now that that \\\\nnumber has grown to more than 7 million. And I have read media \\\\nreports that by the end of fiscal year 2024, so in roughly 6 \\\\nmonths from now, that number will top 8 million.\\\\n    And so at a time in which we have a record flow of \\\\nimmigrants coming across the border, where we now have a record \\\\nnumber of individuals who are on the nondetention docket who \\\\nare going to now very quickly reach over 8 million, and also at \\\\na time in which we have seen media reports involving \\\\nindividuals who are not in the country legally committing a \\\\nviolent crime, is a 34,000 bed number, is that sufficient to \\\\nmeet the needs of your agency?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Thank you, sir. Yes. And thank you for \\\\nmeeting earlier in the week as well. I too would support the \\\\n50,000, as the Secretary stated. And we are comfortable with \\\\nthe 34 because of the contingency fund that they have promised \\\\nme have availability----\\\\n    Mr. Guest. If Congress refuses to support the contingency \\\\nfund, which is what I believe that this body will not do again, \\\\nlooking at the powers of the Constitution and power of the \\\\npurse being related to the Constitution, we as a body, many of \\\\nus, at least, are very reluctant to give any administrative \\\\nagency, regardless of who is in charge, access to billions of \\\\ndollars in contingency funds.\\\\n    And so if we are not going to fund the contingency fund and \\\\nwe are only--and you are going to be limited to the number of \\\\nbeds that have been requested, 34,000 beds, is that sufficient?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. No. If there is no contingency fund and \\\\nthere is no room for a surge in case of capacity need, no, I \\\\nwould not be comfortable with it without that.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. OK. And then one of the other things we have \\\\ntalked about a little bit and it is also in your report is \\\\ndetainers. And in your report it says detainers--and I say \\\\n``your report.&#x27;&#x27; The report issued by your agency.\\\\n    It says, ``Detainers are critical public safety tools \\\\nbecause they allow ICE to focus enforcement resources on \\\\nremovable noncitizens who have been arrested for criminal \\\\nactivity as part of the agency&#x27;s discretionary authority.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Correct.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. And we talked about the fact there are certain \\\\njurisdictions, both local and State jurisdictions, which refuse \\\\nto cooperate with ICE. They refuse to honor detainers.\\\\n    So we have individuals who are first in the country \\\\nlegally. They are in the country legally, and then they commit \\\\ncrimes and in many cases they are ultimately convicted of those \\\\ncrimes, but then we have agencies that refuse to cooperate.\\\\n    So talk about the impediment that that creates for your \\\\nagency to remove those individuals. Talk about the additional \\\\nmanpower and expenses, because once those individuals are \\\\nreleased and the detainer is not honored, then agents working \\\\nunder your direction are having to put themselves in harm&#x27;s way \\\\nto go locate those individuals, arrest those individuals, and \\\\nput them into deportation.\\\\n    And so talk a little bit about the frustration you have \\\\nwith agencies that don&#x27;t honor those detainers and what, if \\\\nanything, should Congress do? Should Congress refuse just to \\\\nignore that and to allow these agencies to suffer no penalties, \\\\nor should Congress seek to maybe withhold Federal funding to \\\\ntry to require these agencies to comply with lawful Federal \\\\ndetainers?\\\\n    And so, with that, Mr. Director, I will give you the floor.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. All right. Thank you. Yes. As I stated \\\\nbefore, we need to collaborate with our State and local \\\\npartners as much as possible. And you said, how does it affect \\\\nour operations. Well, it makes it much more difficult when they \\\\ndo not cooperate and collaborate with us.\\\\n    Any time we have to do an at-large arrest, which is sending \\\\nour fugitive operations teams out into the general public and \\\\ncommunities to grab these individuals, it is inherently more \\\\nunsafe.\\\\n    I said that at a press conference a few months ago for one \\\\nof our operations. It costs a lot more money. It puts our \\\\npeople and, you know, the local citizenry in harm&#x27;s way \\\\npotentially when we are out there and doing that.\\\\n    So I hope to collaborate with State and locals wherever \\\\npossible. In some places it is great, other places it is OK, \\\\nand some places it is bad. But I would like to do it as much as \\\\npossible wherever we can. And I would like everyone to \\\\ncooperate on law enforcement, public safety, and national \\\\nsecurity matters.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. And do you feel that Congress should weigh in \\\\nfor those agencies that refuse to cooperate?\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. I would like anyone to weigh in that could \\\\nhelp.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you. Mr. Lechleitner, thank you for \\\\ncoming today. I appreciate the candor of your testimony.\\\\n    Members are reminded that they can submit any additional \\\\nquestions for the record, and we ask that you respond in a \\\\ntimely manner. I will give you the thumbnail sketch, which may \\\\nfall under incredibly naive or well-informed, allows us to \\\\nschedule all of our actions accordingly.\\\\n    Our last hearing is May 1, and so we plan on working in the \\\\nmonth of May towards a committee markup. So we will be drafting \\\\nlegislation in May as a result of these hearings, that sort of \\\\nthing. I tell you that, one, so you know generally; and two, so \\\\nthat if there are Member questions submitted as followup that \\\\nyou endeavor to be timely in that, as well as if you need \\\\nclarification for anything in that timeframe, we will endeavor \\\\nto make sure you have the information you need.\\\\n    And so, with that, the subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank \\\\nyou, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Lechleitner. Thank you.\\\\n    [Questions and answers submitted for the record follow:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n                                           Tuesday, April 30, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n                     CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nTROY MILLER, ACTING COMMISSIONER, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Subcommittee will come to order.\\\\n    Since I still haven&#x27;t had anybody contact me about really \\\\nmissing me providing opening remarks at one of these, we are \\\\nnot going to fix it if it is not broke.\\\\n    I will yield back from opening remarks. The subject of \\\\ntoday&#x27;s hearing is the fiscal year 2025 budget request for U.S. \\\\nCustoms and Border Protection.\\\\n    I would like to thank our witness, Mr. Commissioner, for \\\\nbeing here. I now recognize the ranking member from Texas&#x27; 28th \\\\nDistrict for his opening remarks, Mr. Cuellar.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Good morning, Commissioner Miller, it is nice seeing you \\\\nhere again. You are the head of one of the most dynamic \\\\nagencies in the federal government. I am sure that most of \\\\nthose days are almost thankless days. But we really appreciate \\\\nwhat your workforce does in between ports, at ports of entry, \\\\nand so many other places that you all serve. So, we want to \\\\nthank you and your folks for the work that you do. Many a times \\\\nyou have to do your work with outdated laws and sometimes not \\\\nenough funding. So we are here to say thank you, and we want to \\\\nmake sure that we provide you the funding that you need.\\\\n    You have been around, I think, since 1993, a Federal career \\\\nwith U.S. Customs as a customs inspector, I haven&#x27;t used that \\\\nfor a while, but we appreciate all the work that you have done.\\\\n    I also want to say that Homeland Security is a priority for \\\\nall of us, and especially myself. I live in Laredo, small \\\\nlittle town, but it is now, out of the 450 airports, seaports, \\\\nborder crossings, we are No. 1. Bigger than LA, bigger than so \\\\nmany places.\\\\n    And in fact, if you look at the Chairman, I got to get you \\\\nand some of the Members down in Laredo, if you look at the \\\\ntrucks that pass through Laredo on a yearly basis and just line \\\\nthem up, they will go around the world 3.2 times.\\\\n    And I checked with your port director in Laredo to make \\\\nsure I had those numbers, 3.2 times around the world, just to \\\\nshow you. And that is only trucks. It doesn&#x27;t include trains \\\\nand doesn&#x27;t include other commerce.\\\\n    So what you do in between ports is very important. But, at \\\\nthe ports of entry, the men and women in blue are very key. We \\\\nwant to work with you. There is a lot of work that we want to \\\\ncover with you. But again, in the interest of time for the \\\\nquestions, we will go ahead and cut my statement short.\\\\n    But just to say thank you. And please thank all your men \\\\nand women, whether they are in blue or in green or tan color or \\\\nthe other uniform folks, we want to say thank you.\\\\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you. And I want to let the ranking member \\\\nknow, because he is probably too young, but I was watching the \\\\ntelevision show Laredo.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Oh, the Streets of Laredo.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei [continuing]. A long time ago. And not only \\\\nthat, but it was one of my proudest moments, as a young SUV \\\\nowner a million years ago, to have bought a set of four \\\\nUniroyal Laredo 31 ten and a half 15 tires for my two-door \\\\nblazer at the time.\\\\n    So I am a fan from way back. If anybody is wondering, that \\\\nit is not an advertisement for that company or those tires. I \\\\nam not even sure that they still make the tires.\\\\n    But, that was just to kind of see if I could get you off \\\\nguard. Mr. Commissioner, the floor is yours for your opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n\\\\n                 Opening Statement: Commissioner Miller\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Chairman Amodei, Ranking Member Cuellar, and \\\\nMembers of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to \\\\ntestify today and discuss the fiscal year 2025 President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\\\\n    Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to \\\\nacknowledge the four law enforcement officers who were killed \\\\nin the line of duty yesterday and those gravely wounded.\\\\n    A senseless tragedy and a stark reminder of the dangers our \\\\nnation&#x27;s law enforcement officers face every day. Our thoughts \\\\nare with their families and colleagues and we hope for a swift \\\\nrecovery for the injured. CBP is standing shoulder to shoulder \\\\nwith you all.\\\\n    It is my distinct honor to represent the men and women of \\\\nthe CBP here today. As a career law enforcement official, I can \\\\nspeak firsthand to the changes I have seen over the last 30 \\\\nyears when I first started with U.S. Customs service.\\\\n    I can honestly tell you I have never been more proud of the \\\\naccomplishments of the CBP workforce than this past year. Just \\\\nlast week, I had the great privilege to recognize some of their \\\\nincredible achievements during our annual commissioner&#x27;s award \\\\nceremony.\\\\n    These awards celebrate the extraordinary works of CBP&#x27;s \\\\ndedicated and talented people that they do every day and their \\\\neveryday heroism, all while facing serious challenges, from \\\\nunprecedented migration flows to increased risk in the trade \\\\nenvironment, to the persistent threats and sophisticated \\\\ntactics of transnational criminal organizations facilitating \\\\ndrugs and human smuggling.\\\\n    I can assure you that the men and women of CBP are up to \\\\nthe challenge. I could not be more grateful to the Members and \\\\nstaff of this Subcommittee for your continued support of CBP&#x27;s \\\\nmission and our workforce.\\\\n    You have ensured that we have the personnel, technology, \\\\nand equipment, and infrastructure to fulfill our broad \\\\nresponsibilities and to take care of our incredible workforce.\\\\n    The fiscal year 2025 President&#x27;s budget builds on CBP&#x27;s \\\\nongoing efforts to expand our situational and domain awareness, \\\\nrespond to emerging threats, and detect and intercept dangerous \\\\ndrugs and contraband.\\\\n    The budget funds critical enhancements to border security \\\\ntechnology, modernizes our facilities and processes to increase \\\\npersonal safety and operational efficiency, and provides for \\\\nadditional agents, officers, and support staff.\\\\n    First and foremost, we are the Nation&#x27;s largest federal law \\\\nenforcement agency at our borders and beyond. CBP continues to \\\\ncounter the threat of sophisticated criminal organizations \\\\nengaged in drug smuggling, as you know, synthetic drugs like \\\\nfentanyl are devastating our communities.\\\\n    In fiscal year 2023, CBP seized 27,000 pounds of fentanyl, \\\\nthe equivalent of approximately 1.2 billion doses. That&#x27;s \\\\nnearly double the amount we seized in fiscal year 2022.\\\\n    Our borders must be the last line of defense, not the \\\\nfirst. So our enforcement efforts are multilayered and begin \\\\nbeyond the borders. That&#x27;s how we are attacking the fentanyl \\\\nproblem.\\\\n    Using intelligence and advanced targeting, we are going \\\\nafter the whole supply chain, from precursor chemicals to \\\\nproduction equipment. We are also enhancing information sharing \\\\nand collaboration with our federal, state, and local \\\\nenforcement partners, foreign governments, and the private \\\\nsector.\\\\n    We are bolstering our enforcement capabilities in the trade \\\\nenvironment, and pursuing key proposals to strengthen our \\\\nability to combat de minimis shipment exploitation. We continue \\\\nto experience serious challenges with increased migration \\\\nbetween the ports of entry.\\\\n    Most of this is being driven by criminal organizations \\\\nengaged in lucrative and cruel human smuggling business. We are \\\\nprioritizing national security and disrupting criminal networks \\\\nwhile maximizing consequences for unlawful entry, including \\\\ndetention, prosecution, and removal.\\\\n    At the end of the day, our goal continues to be getting our \\\\nagents and officers back to the law enforcement mission they \\\\nwere hired to do.\\\\n    The funding you have provided is critical to maximizing our \\\\nimmigration consequence delivery system. Like I said at the \\\\nstart, the men and women of CBP are the driving force of our \\\\nagency.\\\\n    In the coming years, we are expecting a retirement surge \\\\ndue to a large number of personnel reaching eligibility. We are \\\\nplanning now with a human capital strategy to ensure the \\\\nnecessary staffing levels to perform our critical missions.\\\\n    I appreciate your support to confront this challenge by \\\\nincreasing hiring well in advance. As I know you are all well \\\\naware, CBP employees have a difficult and dangerous job. I see \\\\nit as one of my top priorities to take care of our folks.\\\\n    With critical funding and guidance provided by Congress, \\\\nCBP has expanded the availability of key programs like on-site \\\\nclinicians, enhanced our suicide prevention, and chaplaincy and \\\\npeer support programs that are improving employee wellbeing and \\\\nperformance.\\\\n    With your partnership, CBP will continue to build on these \\\\ninvestments and prioritize employee support and resilience. \\\\nThank you for the opportunity to testify today and for your \\\\nunwavering support of CBP&#x27;s mission and our people. I look \\\\nforward to the questions.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.\\\\n    The gentleman from Texas, the ranking member, the floor is \\\\nyours for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    This last appropriation bill, the current one, we have \\\\nenacted funding for 2024 an additional $570 million. That is a \\\\n7 percent increase for CBP&#x27;s border security operations and \\\\nborder technologies over fiscal year 2023.\\\\n    It also provided an additional $561 million. That is a 12.4 \\\\npercent increase to ICE enforcement and removal operations \\\\nbudget over 2023 enacted levels.\\\\n    And that includes an increase from 34,000 beds to 41,500 \\\\nbeds, providing a 14.8 percent increase to ICE transportation \\\\nand operational removal operations.\\\\n    Again, these increases were supported bipartisan, including \\\\nby the administration. We have seen the numbers, and I think \\\\nthe last numbers in between ports, that is border patrol, an \\\\naverage of 3,900 plus individuals, is a lot lower than what we \\\\nwere seeing in December, isn&#x27;t it?\\\\n    So one of the things that we are seeing, and I know \\\\ntraditionally we have had the seasonal up and down, that has \\\\nbeen a little different the last couple of years.\\\\n    But what I want to focus on is when the numbers started \\\\ngoing down, with all respect to all of us, Members of Congress, \\\\nwe didn&#x27;t add any new border wall, we didn&#x27;t add any border \\\\npatrol, we didn&#x27;t add any technology.\\\\n    There was something that happened and part of the reason \\\\nfor this is what Mexico has been doing in other countries. And \\\\nthat is very important because we just can&#x27;t play defense on \\\\nthe one-yard line called the U.S.-Mexico border.\\\\n    So the numbers went down, regardless of what we were doing \\\\nover here. When you look at what Mexico is doing, and there&#x27;s \\\\ndifferent things, as you know, Mexican security, migration, \\\\nfolks, I think at one time, last time I was there with \\\\nCongressman McCaul, I think they had about 34,000 people.\\\\n    That is more than the number of Border Patrol that we have \\\\nand other. And they started, they stepped up the operations to \\\\ninterdict migrants, taking people from the trains, taking them \\\\noff, people that would come to their northern border, our \\\\nsouthern border, they would get them, return them to the \\\\nsouthern border.\\\\n    And that includes migrant removals, deportations. Mexico, \\\\nfrom January, has deported over, just as an example, 7,500 \\\\nGuatemalans back to their country since January. So I say this \\\\nbecause we need to do whatever we need to do at the one-yard \\\\nline called the Mexico border, U.S.-Mexico border.\\\\n    But I think it is key that we continue and I know you&#x27;ve \\\\nbeen involved in some of those conversations, so if you can \\\\ntalk about that and then talk about, Mr. Chairman, Members, \\\\nmaybe some authority that could help you work with the \\\\nMexicans? We will work with the State Department, but if you \\\\ncan talk about some authorities that would help you work with \\\\nMexico better to continue this work.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Thank you for the question and what you \\\\noutlined from fiscal year 2024. It&#x27;s very much appreciated.\\\\n    The committee, the subcommittee, the funding especially for \\\\ntaking care of the base pay and some of those issues that you \\\\njust outlined. So it&#x27;s very important for 2024.\\\\n    You&#x27;re 100 percent right. We work very closely with our \\\\ncolleagues not only in Mexico but South America, Central \\\\nAmerica. We&#x27;ve been working real hard with the Department of \\\\nState, with the eastern hemisphere as well, looking at transit \\\\nvisa, visa requirements to enter this hemisphere, No. 1.\\\\n    Number 2, working very closely with our partners in \\\\nGuatemala, Panama, El Salvador, Nicaragua or not Nicaragua, \\\\nexcuse me, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, up into Mexico.\\\\n    And I have an individual, a senior advisor assigned to me \\\\nthat is solely dedicated to working with Mexico. So we&#x27;re in \\\\nconstant communication, daily communication with Mexico, \\\\ntalking about what we&#x27;re seeing, sharing intelligence, talking \\\\nabout what we&#x27;re seeing in between the ports, what the trends \\\\nare, what sectors are busy, what nationalities we&#x27;re seeing.\\\\n    And Mexico is taking that back and in action in that \\\\nthrough checkpoint operations, as you pointed out, removing \\\\npeople south to their southern border and repatriating more \\\\npeople than they have in the past.\\\\n    You know, as far as the authorities that we would need, \\\\nthat&#x27;s something I&#x27;d have to get back to you and talk to you at \\\\na later stage, but certainly, you know, there&#x27;s a couple things \\\\nthat we could work with you on.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you so much.\\\\n    I yield back Mr. Chairman. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentleman from Maryland, the floor is yours for \\\\nquestions, Dr. Harris.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Acting Commissioner for coming before us.\\\\n    I just have one question and it is pretty brief. It is \\\\nfrom, you know, the visit to the southern border with the \\\\nSpeaker in January. And it was my understanding at that time \\\\nthat if an individual comes into the country with no form of \\\\nidentification and they just give a name and they give a birth \\\\ndate, that unless you can disprove that that is who they are, \\\\nthat they are admitted into the country with, with a piece of \\\\npaper that has that name and that birth date, is that still the \\\\nway things--I mean, was my understanding correct in January? Is \\\\nthat still the way business is conducted?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. First and foremost we work very closely, as I \\\\nstated to the ranking member, with our foreign partners in \\\\nSouth and Central America, and information sharing agreements \\\\nto share information back and forth on who&#x27;s coming into the \\\\nhemisphere.\\\\n    We work very closely also with our foreign partners on \\\\nbiometrics as they move throughout the hemisphere and when they \\\\nenter in between the ports of entry, we, of course, will run \\\\nbiometrics. We will run biographics. We will do our complete \\\\nsuite of checks against law enforcement databases, intelligence \\\\ndatabases, our databases.\\\\n    And ultimately, it is our goal to remove individuals \\\\nquickly that don&#x27;t have an asylum claim.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Well, let&#x27;s just say that this person \\\\noriginated in Iran, or I am assuming we don&#x27;t have access to \\\\ntheir databases. We don&#x27;t have access to their biometrics. So \\\\nlet&#x27;s say this individual&#x27;s, you know, male, in his 20&#x27;s, from \\\\nIran, comes into the United States, says, you know, my name is \\\\nJohn Doe. I was born January 1, 2000. Do you have the ability \\\\nto disprove that?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. If in that particular instance, we would work \\\\nwith the ERO and turn that individual----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Excuse me, with who?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Enforcement and Removal Operations, ICE.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. So you would remove that individual?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. We would turn that individual over to ICE, and \\\\nthey would and that person would go through the proceedings.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. So what individual, and I guess I don&#x27;t \\\\nunderstand this because I am told that you can come into the \\\\ncountry without an ID and be released into the interior. So how \\\\nwould that individual be any different?\\\\n    I mean, they are not going to tell you they came from Iran. \\\\nThey are going to tell you they came from some other country, \\\\nbut they originate in Iran. So all their biometric data, their \\\\nID data, law enforcement data, it is all in Iran.\\\\n    So why would that person be removed? Why would that person \\\\nbe removed and not someone else coming in with a, who doesn&#x27;t \\\\nhave a form of ID?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. So again, as I explained, we have information \\\\nsharing agreements with countries throughout the hemisphere. \\\\nThat individual had to get in the hemisphere using some sort of \\\\ntravel document on an airline with some sort of manifest \\\\ninformation.\\\\n    So that&#x27;s where the process starts. And the process starts \\\\nthroughout the hemisphere or goes throughout the hemisphere. \\\\nAnd as the individual is encountered, we will do a risk \\\\nassessment on every single individual. As I stated, our goal \\\\nis, given the capability, to turn that individual over to ICE \\\\nfor removal proceedings.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. So let&#x27;s say that person comes into Venezuela, \\\\nwhere I assume we don&#x27;t have a whole lot of agreements with \\\\nthem. How would we, I just don&#x27;t understand.\\\\n    How is that person different from anyone else? I mean, they \\\\ncome in they don&#x27;t tell you they are from Iran. They come \\\\nthrough Venezuela, which is not a friendly nation to us.\\\\n    I am assuming we don&#x27;t have extensive information data \\\\nsharing with Venezuela. So you can confidently say that Iran is \\\\nnot smuggling people into this country through a system where \\\\nif somebody has no identification, they won&#x27;t be allowed \\\\nentrance into this country? You can confidently say that?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. I can confidently say we&#x27;re doing our best to \\\\nidentify every single individual coming into this country and \\\\nvet them through appropriate systems.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. But if no red flags come up on that individual \\\\nsomewhere, that person will be admitted into the interior. Is \\\\nthat, that was my understanding again, from what I was told at \\\\nthe border in January.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. He or she will not be admitted into the \\\\ninterior----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. With no red flags. I mean, no red flags come up \\\\nanywhere. No red flags come from all this information sharing. \\\\nSo we are not admitting people into the interior who don&#x27;t have \\\\nidentification?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Admit would be the wrong terminology. We could \\\\nrelease somebody with a notice to appear.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Oh, a notice to appear. OK, so that--so we \\\\nwould be counting on this young Iranian to basically show up \\\\nsomewhere at an office in the interior after they released the \\\\ninterior? That sounds like a plan that is pretty dangerous.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. No, actually, we would be counting on our \\\\nvetting and information sharing agreements to identify that \\\\ninformation and put them in the appropriate pathway.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Underwood, the floor is \\\\nyours for questions.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Good morning, Commissioner Miller. CBP is tasked with a \\\\nvital role in our nation&#x27;s immigration system. And your agency \\\\nis one of the world&#x27;s largest law enforcement agencies.\\\\n    Your agency has custody of many migrants and provides \\\\ncritical services necessary to safeguard our country, including \\\\nthe administration of basic health services. And many of us \\\\nmourn the loss of eight-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez, \\\\nwho passed away after being held in CBP custody for over a \\\\nweek.\\\\n    And in light of her death, it is clear that changes must be \\\\nmade and further oversight is warranted to ensure that all \\\\nmigrants who encounter CBP are treated with basic human dignity \\\\nand consideration.\\\\n    It is clear we have more work to do to ensure that CBP \\\\ncontractors are held accountable for their failures and to \\\\nguarantee that the process for awarding contracts is \\\\ncompetitive enough to drive excellence.\\\\n    In the wake of Anadith&#x27;s death, what changes has CBP made \\\\nto improve oversight of its existing medical services \\\\ncontracts?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Thank you for the question. So I&#x27;d like to \\\\nstart with number one, after that tragic event, we worked very, \\\\nvery closely, or I worked very closely with the U.S. Border \\\\nPatrol to ensure that, number one, individuals that had \\\\npreexisting medical conditions and family units got out of our \\\\ncustody as quickly as possible, right?\\\\n    So first and foremost, as you know, we don&#x27;t have long-term \\\\ndetention capabilities. Second of all, we looked at the entire \\\\nprocess to determine where the gaps are and what we needed to \\\\nfix.\\\\n    So as far as the contract with the medical service, which \\\\nis in the competitive stage right now, we turn that contract, \\\\nfor the integrity of the contract, to the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security, who is now doing that process.\\\\n    But we also looked at the entirety of the process and how \\\\nwe care for individuals. Number 1, we defined a seminal event. \\\\nNumber 2, we hired government personnel for contract oversight \\\\nso that we had more contract oversight.\\\\n    Number 3, we defined medical at-risk individuals and we \\\\nensured that they were identified and that information was \\\\nbeing passed from shift to shift, watch commander to watch \\\\ncommander, from the U.S. Border patrol.\\\\n    Number 4, we made changes to our system to ensure that it \\\\nwas appropriately flagging those individuals that were at risk. \\\\nAnd five, we made changes to ensure that we were appropriately \\\\npassing that information to the healthcare system and the folks \\\\nthat were passing those or those people were getting sent to \\\\nfor that medical care.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. I am so happy to hear about these changes \\\\nthat CBP has made, because kids shouldn&#x27;t be dying while in our \\\\ncustody. And when it comes to future contracts for medical \\\\nservices, what changes are you making to improve the vetting of \\\\nvendors?\\\\n    I know that this particular one is in review, but I think \\\\nthat system wide, we can speak to changes that might be made to \\\\nvet vendors and ensure that CBP awards these contracts to high \\\\nquality providers.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Yeah, and that&#x27;s what I discussed up front. So \\\\nthe contract is currently out for bid, a new contract, and that \\\\nis with Department of Homeland Security, who is going through \\\\nthat process right now.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. So they are the ones making changes to \\\\nreview the vetting?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. OK. Well, I certainly understand the large \\\\nscale needs that CBP has and the realities that you&#x27;re facing \\\\nabsent comprehensive immigration reform legislation moving \\\\nthrough Congress.\\\\n    However, the American message has always been clear. We are \\\\na nation that provides liberty and justice for all, and as we \\\\nlive out these values, we must ensure that those in our care \\\\nare not neglected or overlooked.\\\\n    Moving forward, can your team commit to providing this \\\\nCommittee with more detailed, regular updates on CBP&#x27;s \\\\noversight of its medical services providers? And this includes \\\\nevaluations of the work being done by current and future CBP \\\\ncontractors to ensure that everything is being done to prevent \\\\nanother death in custody?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Absolutely.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Thank you, Commissioner Miller.\\\\n    My hope is that the services provided by CBP will do more \\\\nto keep people safe than to cause harm, which I think, by and \\\\nlarge, the agency has certainly been doing.\\\\n    I was proud to have worked with your agency on securing \\\\nfunding in previous appropriations legislation that improved \\\\nCBP&#x27;s electronic health record system. That was a vital step in \\\\nthe right direction, and I hope that my colleagues will join me \\\\nin prioritizing this work as we move forward in fiscal year \\\\n2025. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Yeah, I would like to, if I could in closing, \\\\nthank you for the Committee for their continued support of the \\\\nfunding for the medical service contract.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentleman from Washington state, Mr. Newhouse, the \\\\nfloor is yours for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member.\\\\n    Thank you, Acting Commissioner, for being here with us to \\\\ntalk about your budget proposal for 2025. I also want to convey \\\\nmy thanks to the men and women that work in the CBP for all \\\\ntheir service and express my appreciation.\\\\n    It has been clear for several years now that under this \\\\nadministration, we&#x27;ve seen an increase, an exponential increase \\\\nin encounters and illegal crossings at the southwest border.\\\\n    But at the same time, the northern border, which has a \\\\nfraction of the resources available, is also on pace to have \\\\nanother record year of encounters.\\\\n    While the budget proposal does not request or does request \\\\nadditional agents to address administration created crisis at \\\\nthe southern border, I don&#x27;t think it is serious enough to \\\\naddress the real issues that we have on both borders.\\\\n    For instance, in fiscal year 2021, there were just over \\\\n27,000 encounters along the longest international border on the \\\\nglobe. By the end of fiscal year 2025, this number was over \\\\n100, excuse me, fiscal year 2023, this number was over 189,000.\\\\n    There are a lot of differences between the northern border \\\\nand the southern border. Certainly a different approach is \\\\nrequired.\\\\n    Last week, I was extremely frustrated that the National \\\\nPark Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced \\\\nthat they will be airdropping grizzly bears, that have a \\\\nmigration range of up to 1,000 miles, into the North Cascades \\\\necosystem, which is completely disregarding local public \\\\nopinion.\\\\n    Recognizing there is substantial National Park Service \\\\nmanaged land along both our land borders, are you aware if \\\\nthere&#x27;s any data to show that illegal entries are higher or \\\\nlower on lands that have a threat of apex predators?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. I am not aware of any data. I would like to, if \\\\nI could, we have, for the first time, back to your first point. \\\\nFor the first time in a long time, we&#x27;ve started hiring \\\\ndirectly into the northern border sectors.\\\\n    Number two, I think an area you&#x27;re talking about in the \\\\nCascade region, is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. North Cascade.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. North Cascade, very, very few border patrol \\\\nagents out in that area. As you know, we do have what&#x27;s \\\\ncalled--we have sensors, and we do train the sensors on threats \\\\nto agents and some of those things with artificial \\\\nintelligence, machine learning, which obviously, in this case, \\\\nwe would do that.\\\\n    And as far as the crossings, up in that particular area, \\\\nI&#x27;d have to get back to.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Well, I am wondering if the Park Service aim \\\\nto support a whole of government approach, maybe to secure the \\\\nborder and disincentivize illegal immigration on the northern \\\\nborder with the threat of predators like wolves and grizzly \\\\nbears.\\\\n    Maybe that is what they meant by catering to visitors who \\\\nseek to experience grizzly bears in their native habitat. Just \\\\nguessing.\\\\n    Did the Park Service or Fish and Wildlife Service consult \\\\nwith or notify CBP before deciding to airdrop these predators \\\\ninto the backyard of agents at the Colville, Curlew or Oroville \\\\nstations?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Not to my knowledge.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I didn&#x27;t think so. In remote locations, I \\\\ndon&#x27;t think it is uncommon for agents to respond to illegal \\\\nactivity by themselves. And as you said, there are not that \\\\nmany agents up there to begin with.\\\\n    They may be the only agent for dozens of miles. Among other \\\\nconcerns, I believe a legitimate one is agent safety because of \\\\nthis decision. Do CBP training protocols include how to address \\\\na threat to life and safety posed by a large, potentially \\\\naggressive wild animal like a bear?\\\\n    And how does CBP equip agents with the resources necessary \\\\nto defend themselves just in case they are attacked by an \\\\naggressive grizzly bear?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. We do. We do have training in those remote \\\\nlocations for things like mountain lions and grizzly bears, \\\\nbelieve it or not, we do get to training from the Park Service. \\\\nAnd, you know, the spray, the firearms and the like. You know \\\\nthat they will defend themselves. The agents will.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Well, I would suggest that you step up that \\\\ntraining and make it available to the folks up in Washington.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. We will.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentlelady from Iowa, Ms. Hinson, the floor is yours \\\\nfor questions.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member \\\\nCuellar. And thank you, Acting Commissioner, for coming before \\\\nus today.\\\\n    I appreciate your openness to having good conversations \\\\nwith our committee about your needs. I want to talk today about \\\\nsomething that&#x27;s very important to me. Just a few weeks ago, in \\\\nour Select Committee on China, we had a hearing on fentanyl \\\\nabout how communist China is working directly with the cartels \\\\nto funnel fentanyl precursors into our country by any means \\\\nnecessary.\\\\n    And their goal, plain and simple, is to take out as many \\\\nAmericans as possible. Can you speak to what you are observing, \\\\nin terms of high volumes of small packages containing these \\\\nfentanyl precursors coming in from China, originating from \\\\nChina, and maybe some other concerning trends that you might be \\\\nseeing?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Thank you for the question. And yes, last \\\\nfiscal year 2023, as everybody in this committee knows, \\\\nsubcommittee knows, we made a concerted effort on our southwest \\\\nborder to start with and increase operations going after \\\\nfentanyl, and we nearly doubled our seizures.\\\\n    But along with our increased operations on the southwest \\\\nborder, we were collecting information, intelligence, to \\\\ndetermine where we would go next.\\\\n    And through those operations, we determined that precursors \\\\nwere coming through in transit, through our airports of entry, \\\\nin small packages, and going to the southwest border and \\\\nultimately into Mexico, where the fentanyl is being produced.\\\\n    So through those efforts, we surged resources to our \\\\nairports of entry to look at de minimis packages, small \\\\npackages, those mostly under $800, manifested as under $800.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Were there specific airports that were----\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Los Angeles and JFK.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. OK, so it is coming into the United States, \\\\ngoing back to Mexico, and then coming back into the United \\\\nStates?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. It was. And so what we, as we were looking at \\\\nthis, what we figured out was that was coming through the small \\\\npackage environment. And just to your first question.\\\\n    So we went from 600 million packages in 2022 to a billion \\\\npackages, small packages, in 2023, to 4 million packages a day \\\\nas we sit here right now. And so as we were looking, as we were \\\\ndoing the increased examinations to cut to the chase, we were \\\\nseeing precursors in transit through Southeast Asia, coming in, \\\\noriginating in China, coming through mostly JFK and Los \\\\nAngeles, and going down to the southwest border and into \\\\nMexico.\\\\n    Along with that, we were searching resources to our express \\\\nconsignment, our mail facilities, and we&#x27;re finding pill \\\\npresses, dies, and molds coming from China into our express \\\\nenvironments through small packages.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. This is completely intentional by them, you \\\\nknow, pounds, not ounces, of fentanyl, all of these \\\\nmanufacturing equipment, the pieces of equipment that they need \\\\nto execute this.\\\\n    I think this is not only a safety issue, but it seems like \\\\nit is a blatant and systematic attack on our communities. Do \\\\nyou agree?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. What I will say is we need help in the de \\\\nminimis environment, and there are several packages out there \\\\nthat will allow us to have the appropriate data, number one, to \\\\ndetermine where the shipment is coming from, what&#x27;s in the \\\\npackage, where it&#x27;s going, and the appropriate funds to be able \\\\nto fund our CBP officers to open the packages, and the \\\\nappropriate penalties to assess those that are carrying those \\\\npackages when they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s actually in the package.\\\\n    And then there are additional legislative packages out \\\\nthere that would allow us to actually bring that level down to \\\\na manageable level for us.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. We look forward to working with you on that \\\\nbecause it is very clear and it is appalling the lengths that \\\\nChina is willing to go to to funnel these precursors into our \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    And, I mean, they are already subsidizing it for export \\\\nonly, right? Not for domestic production, but for export to \\\\ndirectly poison Americans and others around the world.\\\\n    One thing, in the time I have left, I see your budget has a \\\\nlack of funding for new autonomous systems at ports of entry. \\\\nCan you speak to why, when we know that technology is critical?\\\\n    We&#x27;ve helped to deploy much of that over the past few \\\\nyears, that you are prioritizing traditional manpower over some \\\\nof these force multiplier systems?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. So we need both. We all know that the \\\\nsequencing of this budget year was a little bit difficult. So \\\\nwe certainly need additional technology, artificial \\\\nintelligence, machine learning, in particular, at our ports of \\\\nentry as we go after the fentanyl problem.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Well, we will continue to make that a priority \\\\nin our office to make those investments. We understand how \\\\nimportant they are to you. Thank you, Commissioner.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Guest, you are \\\\nrecognized for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Commissioner Miller, thank you for being here today. Thank \\\\nyou for visiting with me and my staff earlier in the week. I \\\\nwant to let you know that you and I have had many \\\\nconversations. I find you to be extremely honest and \\\\ntrustworthy.\\\\n    I know you have 30 years of experience with your agency and \\\\nwant to thank you and the men and women that you serve with for \\\\nthe job that you do. And looking at the budget, it appears like \\\\nthat the President has requested a $3 million decrease in the \\\\nCBP budget; is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Actually, the numbers are, I believe there&#x27;s a \\\\ntad bit of an increase in the overall budget.\\\\n    So if you----\\\\n    Mr. Guest. As far as the discretionary, though, for CBP and \\\\ntaking out these contingency funds, slush fund, whatever you \\\\nwant to call it, just the baseline funding for CBP is roughly a \\\\n$3 billion decrease from what CBP received in fiscal year 2024, \\\\nis that accurate or close to accurate, Commissioner?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. The delta is accounted for in the contingency \\\\nfund.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. All right. And again, taking out contingency \\\\nfund.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. So it&#x27;s essentially the same.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. So the same funding? So there is not--again, if \\\\nthere is no contingency fund, there is level funding, then \\\\nthere is not a $3 billion decrease for CBP?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. No, I would still need the fund, the border \\\\nfunds.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Yes, and I am not saying you don&#x27;t need it. I am \\\\njust saying it is not in the request. Look I understand, you \\\\nneed it and I want to give it to you, but I want to put it in \\\\nyour base budget.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. But I just want to be clear that the numbers we \\\\nare working on, that have been submitted, not necessarily by \\\\nyou, but by the administration. So a $3 billion baseline \\\\ndecrease for CBP versus any increase.\\\\n    And I know that you were vocal that you supported the \\\\nSenate legislation that was being proposed, and in that \\\\nlegislation, as I recall, there was actually going to be $6.8 \\\\nbillion in additional funding for CBP.\\\\n    Would have hired 1,500 new agents, would have been an \\\\nincrease to the number of ICE, 1,500 new CBP agents would have \\\\nincreased the number of ICE agents and there would have been \\\\nincreases in technology, in your budget for technology.\\\\n    But that money that you supported then is not contained in \\\\nthis budget, right? There is no $6.8 billion increase for CBP. \\\\nThere is no, I think there is 300 or 350 new agents, but there \\\\nis not 1,500 additional agents.\\\\n    And so the additional funding, that you supported in the \\\\nSenate, the President chose not to include that in his budget, \\\\nis that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. So I misunderstood your first question. So yes, \\\\nessentially, there&#x27;s $2.7 billion in the contingency fund that \\\\nwe feel we need that money. So wherever it is placed, we need \\\\nit.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Yeah. And I want to put it in your baseline \\\\nbudget. I want you to have that money. And I am not advocating, \\\\nand I don&#x27;t want you to believe that I am up here--matter of \\\\nfact, I want you to have more money than that.\\\\n    You know, I think that you need to have not only the money \\\\nthat we put in the baseline budget last year, but based upon \\\\nthe additional responsibilities, I think CBP budget needs to be \\\\nincreased.\\\\n    But I don&#x27;t want it to be in a contingency fund where \\\\nsomebody else can decide that. I want that to be in the \\\\nbaseline budget. So you can budget for the number of agents \\\\nthat you need and that you can know that you can meet the \\\\ndemand for CBP without having to, every quarter, hope that the \\\\nSecretary gives you additional funding. Because I think that is \\\\na terrible way to run a government agency.\\\\n    And so I want you to have that money. And I wish that the \\\\nmoney that you supported in the Senate bill, I wish the \\\\nPresident would have put it in this baseline bill. I wish he \\\\nwould have asked for more money for CBP because again, I want \\\\nto give you that money, but we are being hamstrung by a budget \\\\nfrom the administration that is not asking us to do that.\\\\n    Let me ask you this, Mr. Commissioner, are detention beds, \\\\nare they crucial to the mission of securing the border and what \\\\nCBP tries to do?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Yes, it&#x27;s essential that the entire immigration \\\\ncontinuum is funded.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. All right. And so fiscal year 2024, Congress \\\\nappropriated funding for 41,500 beds. The President&#x27;s budget \\\\nthis year only asked for 34,000. The Senate bill, which UN \\\\nSecretary Mayorkas supported, had 50,000 in there.\\\\n    And so I continue to be concerned in that we are seeing the \\\\nadministration request numbers significantly lower for CBP and \\\\nfor detention beds, things that are important when they are, \\\\nwhen they are requesting that their budget.\\\\n    And I am not, I hope my frustration does not come that it \\\\nis addressed to you. Unfortunately, you are the one that the \\\\nadministration sent over here to defend the budget. And so that \\\\nis why I started the conversation with how much I trust you and \\\\nthink you are doing a great job.\\\\n    But again, please express my frustrations to the \\\\nadministration that when they submit a budget that is wholly \\\\ninadequate and expect us to start there, that we don&#x27;t \\\\nappreciate that.\\\\n    But thank you again for your service. Thank you for being \\\\nhere.\\\\n    And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Rutherford, the \\\\nfloor is yours for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Commissioner, \\\\ngreat to see you here, thank you. And I want to get back to a \\\\nconversation that&#x27;s--I think is being had just about \\\\neverywhere, and that is concerning migrant--illegal immigrant, \\\\nactually, vetting that goes on at the border.\\\\n    I bring this topic up at every meeting, because in my \\\\ndistrict I had a constituent killed by an individual who came \\\\nacross and was not identified, yet he was released in the \\\\ninterior of the country.\\\\n    And so, my question is--so, I keep trying to get a better \\\\nhandle on how CBP and ICE are actually handling the vetting \\\\nprocess, and what--so, when agents encounter someone, they \\\\nprocess--they take them to a processing center, but let&#x27;s say \\\\nthis individual is not in any system that you have, there&#x27;s no \\\\nbiometrics on them, no ID, no documents. How does CBP handle \\\\nthat person? You don&#x27;t know who they are. How do you handle \\\\nthat?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Well, thank you for the question, and it&#x27;s good \\\\nto see you again likewise. So, in--we had this conversation a \\\\nsecond ago. But, so number one, we would like to take \\\\neverything we do away from the border. So, I think it&#x27;s vitally \\\\nimportant that we continue, and understanding that we don&#x27;t \\\\nhave information sharing agreements with all countries.\\\\n    We would like to share information with our colleagues \\\\nthroughout this hemisphere, South America, Central America, and \\\\nwe do. We would like to share biographic data, biometric data, \\\\nencountered----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. But the question is, sir, what do you do \\\\nwhen they don&#x27;t, and you can&#x27;t? You have no idea who this \\\\nindividual is. What are you going to do with them?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Well, again, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to explain. \\\\nSo, as we--as they come through the hemisphere and that \\\\ninformation is collected, we have those information sharing \\\\nagreements. Our goal is to run that individual against all \\\\ndatabases we have.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK, and there&#x27;s nothing there.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Any----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. I&#x27;m jumping ahead for you. There&#x27;s nothing \\\\nthere. You can look at all your systems, you can process them \\\\nall you want. There&#x27;s nothing there. This--you don&#x27;t know who \\\\nthis individual is. What are you going to do with him?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. So, I would go back to the conversation we just \\\\nhad. My preference is----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. And I&#x27;m sorry I wasn&#x27;t here.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. No, with Mr. Guest. My preference is the \\\\nmigration continuum. All the agencies within--whether it&#x27;s \\\\nCustoms and Border Protection, ICE, our citizenship and \\\\nimmigration services are funded appropriately with the \\\\nappropriate authorities, and that we&#x27;re able to detain \\\\nindividuals that don&#x27;t have a legitimate asylum claim, and \\\\nremove them.\\\\n    We do not have long term detention capabilities in Customs \\\\nand Border Protection, nor should we. We need to get our agents \\\\nback in between the ports of entry where they belong doing the \\\\nlaw enforcement mission, and give them all the available \\\\ninformation as quickly as possible to make the appropriate \\\\ndecision with that individual that&#x27;s----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK, so you&#x27;re telling me----\\\\n    Mr. Miller [continuing]. In front of them.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford [continuing]. That these individuals are \\\\ngoing to be detained?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. I said that&#x27;s my preference.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. My preference is that they are detained. If we \\\\ndo not have the capacity to detain them, we cannot.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Then why in the world would they ask to cut \\\\ndetention bids?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. I&#x27;m here representing Customs and Border \\\\nProtection, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Yes, I know. OK. So, what--can you--so, you \\\\nwant to detain them, but you&#x27;re unable. Then you put them on \\\\nATD?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Yes. So, we would work with our colleagues in \\\\nICE who would put the individuals on ATD.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. Well, I see my time is up, Mr. \\\\nChairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Go ahead and finish up if you want. I&#x27;m your \\\\noriginal time.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you very much. Last time we were here \\\\ntalking about hiring, the fiscal year 2024 bill included hiring \\\\nfor 22,000 agents. So, I think this conversation is even more \\\\nimportant now.\\\\n    You mentioned that you were trying to increase the number \\\\nof applications you had coming in, and increased the attrition \\\\nrate at the academy. Can you share an update on those efforts, \\\\nand have you been able to keep the number of applicants up, and \\\\nthe academy attrition down?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Yes, sir. And thank you for that question, \\\\nbecause it&#x27;s so vitally important, especially now. And if I \\\\ncould, I know our time is up, but to give a little context to \\\\nthe question, we doubled--border patrol doubled their staffing \\\\nbetween 2002 and 2011, right? So, they doubled it.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. It went from 10,000 to 20,000, which means we \\\\nhave a large amount of folks retiring. Our attrition rate \\\\nremains at about 6 percent, and it has for the last several \\\\nyears. So, our attrition is not going down, but to your point, \\\\nor start going up----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. The overall attrition----\\\\n    Mr. Miller. The overall----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. The overall attrition is not going up?\\\\n    Mr. Miller. The overall attrition is remaining steady right \\\\nnow, but with that hiring surge doubling our border patrol \\\\nagents in that 10 years, you know, we expect in the next five \\\\nyears we&#x27;re going to start to see more and more folks retire. \\\\nNumber one, we have decreased our academy from 30 percent \\\\nattrition rate to nine to ten percent, so we&#x27;ve done just that.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. That&#x27;s good.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. Our applications are up 37 percent. So, we&#x27;ve \\\\nincreased----\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Really?\\\\n    Mr. Miller [continuing]. Our applications, but if I--if I \\\\nmay take a second, we also have a problem at our ports of \\\\nentry. Our ports of entry, the folks in blue.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. We&#x27;re going to have what we think is a 400 \\\\npercent increase in retirements in 2028. Why is that? In 2008, \\\\nthey got--the folks in blue got law enforcement coverage. So, \\\\nin 2028--that&#x27;s 20 years, so that they can begin retiring. So, \\\\nwe have a lot of individuals waiting for 2028. We need to focus \\\\non hiring. We have acute human capital strategy that this \\\\nCommittee asked for. We appreciate it. We need to execute on \\\\nthat strategy now. We need to have a plan where we start hiring \\\\nin advance of 2028--in fact, over hire in 2026 and 2027, so we \\\\ndon&#x27;t have that 400 percent attrition rate when 2028 hits us.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. Miller. We need to fund the academy, because the \\\\nacademy is going to need additional spending.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. My time is way over, and I thank you, Mr. \\\\nChairman, but I will tell you, I think if we got operational \\\\ncontrol of the southern border, those things will take care of \\\\nthemselves, too. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Commissioner Miller for coming \\\\ntoday. I appreciate that. Questions that members may have left \\\\nwith you, I would ask that you go ahead and turn those around \\\\nas soon as possible.\\\\n    If members have additional questions that they want to \\\\nsubmit to Mr. Miller&#x27;s organization, then please do so. I want \\\\nto remind everybody that we are on a target pace for trying to \\\\ngo to subcommittee markup in about 30 days.\\\\n    I say that to say we are not going to be hasty, but we are \\\\ngoing to attempt to be crisp. And so, that exchange of \\\\ninformation--if any members are having a problem with getting \\\\nquestions processed or whatever, please let the committee know, \\\\nbecause we want to help make sure that the information that \\\\nneeds to flow flows in an expeditious manner. And so, with \\\\nthat, I want to thank the members for being here today, and \\\\ncommittee stands adjourned.\\\\n    [Questions and answers submitted for the record follow:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n                                           Tuesday, April 30, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n                   CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE \\\\n                            SECURITY AGENCY\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nJEN EASTERLY, DIRECTOR, CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY \\\\n    AGENCY\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The subcommittee will come to order.\\\\n    The subject of today&#x27;s hearing is the fiscal year 2025 \\\\nbudget for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, or \\\\nphonetically, CISA.\\\\n    Thank you for doing that phonetically for me, staff. I \\\\nwould like to thank you, Director Easterly, for being here. And \\\\nI now recognize our ranking member from Texas for his opening \\\\nremarks.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, \\\\nDirector. As you know, our adversary continues to leverage \\\\ncyber tactics to threaten our national security, our economy, \\\\nand our way of life.\\\\n    It is hard to find a day where we are not learning of a new \\\\nattack on the school system, critical infrastructure, our \\\\nhealthcare data, or a federal agency, which is, again, \\\\nsomething that is very important to the work that you do.\\\\n    These threats are posed by individual bad actors, \\\\ntransnational criminal organizations, foreign adversaries like \\\\nstate sponsored groups and nations. While their capabilities \\\\nare increasingly more advanced, we also continue to learn basic \\\\ncyber hygiene issues, such as improper password management \\\\nprotocols, challenges while securing outdated systems and \\\\nequipment.\\\\n    The fiscal year 2025 budget proposal for CISA is just over \\\\n3 billion, which is about $136 million above the fiscal year \\\\n2024 enacted. While it includes several important investments, \\\\nsuch as the $470 million for Continuous Diagnosis and \\\\nMitigation Program and $394 million for the JCE, Joint \\\\nCooperative Environment.\\\\n    I am concerned about whether we are doing enough, given the \\\\nresources advantages of those that are wishing to cause \\\\nproblems to our cybersecurity systems and our critical \\\\ninfrastructure.\\\\n    As you know, our adversaries are not limited by what \\\\nCongress is willing to fund them. They find the money one way \\\\nor the other, and they aren&#x27;t required to play by the same \\\\nrules as our agencies are.\\\\n    I am disappointed by the cuts that we had to make to CISA&#x27;s \\\\nbudget in the 2024 bill, but again, many people don&#x27;t know, but \\\\nCISA&#x27;s budget is primarily funded by the so-called defense \\\\ndollars.\\\\n    For us, on this committee, that means we can&#x27;t simply \\\\nreduce funding elsewhere while our bill increases funding for \\\\nCISA. So again, we need to work on the funding part of it.\\\\n    We know that the PRC is not our only threat. Our nation&#x27;s \\\\ncyber frontier and critical infrastructure are far too \\\\nvulnerable to attack, and we must do more to make sure that we \\\\noutpace our adversaries.\\\\n    So again, you all play a very unique and vital role in \\\\npartnering with our federal agency, state and local \\\\ngovernments, the private sector, and the critical \\\\ninfrastructure owners and operators to make sure that we \\\\nprotect them against emerging and evolving threats.\\\\n    So again, we want to hear about the challenges and the \\\\nopportunities that their agency is looking at to ensure our \\\\nsecurity and operational vitality of our federal networks and \\\\nour nation&#x27;s critical infrastructure.\\\\n    Again, I want to say thank you so much for the work that \\\\nyou and your men and women are doing. We hope we can also hear \\\\none more thing before I close, about the State and local \\\\nCybersecurity Grant Program and what you expect to come from \\\\nthat funding.\\\\n    So again, thank you for all the work that you do and look \\\\nforward to asking you a few questions. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Director Easterly, you are recognized for your opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Chairman Amodei, Ranking Member Cuellar, \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, thank you so much for the \\\\nopportunity to testify on CISA&#x27;s budget.\\\\n    As America&#x27;s cyber defense agency and the national \\\\ncoordinator for critical infrastructure, security, and \\\\nresilience, CISA leads the national effort to understand, \\\\nmanage, and reduce risk to our cyber and physical \\\\ninfrastructure.\\\\n    And I&#x27;m particularly excited to be talking to you today \\\\ngiven this morning&#x27;s release of National Security Memorandum \\\\n22, which reinforces CISA&#x27;s role of managing cross sector risk \\\\nto the cyber infrastructure that Americans rely on every hour \\\\nof every day.\\\\n    The fiscal year 2025 President&#x27;s budget requests 3 billion \\\\nfor CISA, $136 million more than what you appropriated in \\\\nfiscal year 2024. It&#x27;s critically important to continue the \\\\nstrong and steady investment Congress has made in CISA&#x27;s \\\\nmission to protect the nation from increasingly complex \\\\nthreats.\\\\n    While our mission is broad and diverse, I&#x27;m going to \\\\nbriefly highlight just three areas that encompass the increases \\\\nthat we&#x27;re requesting. And in response to your specific \\\\ndirection from last year, I&#x27;m going to point out how we&#x27;ve \\\\nlinked outcomes to appropriations. Specifically, how we&#x27;re \\\\nusing the budget to materially drive down risk in communities \\\\nacross the nation. First key area, federal cybersecurity.\\\\n    As the operational lead for the .gov, we leveraged some \\\\n$600 million to defend these .gov networks as a single \\\\nenterprise protecting America&#x27;s sensitive data and federal \\\\nagencies. And through Congress&#x27; support, we&#x27;ve been able to \\\\ndetect and respond faster than ever before.\\\\n    One, using the CDM Program, that the ranking member \\\\nmentioned, we&#x27;ve been able to remediate over 25 million \\\\nunpatched vulnerabilities and reduce the number of \\\\nvulnerabilities that have been exposed for 45 days or more by \\\\n72 percent.\\\\n    Two, we&#x27;ve deployed Endpoint Detection and Response tools \\\\nto over 50 agencies covering 900,000 devices, deployed \\\\ndetections that allowed us to find over 1,900 threats so that \\\\nwe could mitigate risk to .gov networks.\\\\n    And three, our shared services deployed to 100 federal \\\\nagencies are saving taxpayer dollars. Our Protective Domain \\\\nName Solution Service, for example, has blocked more than 692 \\\\nmillion malicious connections since the start of this fiscal \\\\nyear.\\\\n    The second key area of investment as we look at the threats \\\\nto our nation, none is more serious than Chinese cyber actors \\\\nthat are burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to \\\\nprepare to launch disruptive and destructive attacks in the \\\\nevent of a major conflict.\\\\n    Now, we&#x27;re doing a lot on this. To your point, we can do \\\\nmore. But let me tell you what we&#x27;re doing now with our budget.\\\\n    First, we deployed threat hunting teams across multiple \\\\nsectors, water, power, energy, and transportation to find and \\\\neradicate these Chinese cyber actors. And we&#x27;ve shared insights \\\\nwith others before they become victims. Now, these PRC hunting \\\\nmissions are just part of our larger hunting missions. In just \\\\nfiscal year 2023, we conducted 97 hunt engagements to eradicate \\\\nthreat actors from U.S. critical infrastructure. And we shared \\\\nover 1,100 cyber advisories to enable risk reduction at scale.\\\\n    Two, we use our Cyber Sentry platform that is best in class \\\\ndetection to enable us to drive down risk to the most important \\\\ncritical infrastructure. We are talking pipelines, energy \\\\ngeneration, large airports, critical manufacturing. We have 30 \\\\ncompanies, with 15 more joining.\\\\n    Three, our Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, or JCDC, now \\\\nwith 320 private sector companies, has an active planning \\\\neffort with key industry partners to mitigate risk from Chinese \\\\ntargeting as part of a broader risk reduction effort, which has \\\\nproduced 93 joint cyber alerts and 14 cyber defense plans.\\\\n    Finally, the third key area of investment. While nearly all \\\\ncritical infrastructure sectors are priority targets for nation \\\\nstate actors and cybercriminals, many do not have the resources \\\\nto protect themselves. So, based on the budget you&#x27;ve given us, \\\\nwe&#x27;ve stood in to support them. Specifically, we&#x27;ve grown our \\\\nfield presence across the nation by 35 percent, quadrupling the \\\\nengagements that we have across the country fourfold from 22 to \\\\n23.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve leveraged our pre-ransomware notification initiative \\\\nto do 1,900 such notifications to schools, water facilities, \\\\nand hospitals to prevent organizations from suffering from \\\\nransomware. We&#x27;ve also used our vulnerability warning pilot to \\\\nprovide 2,000 notifications to organizations driving mitigation \\\\nof over 3 million vulnerabilities across 7,600 organizations \\\\nsince 2021. And of note, our ability to proactively warn \\\\nbusinesses will only increase when we implement cyber incident \\\\nreporting. And in fiscal year 2025, that will be the year that \\\\nwe need to ensure we have the infrastructure in place to \\\\nanalyze and report in accordance with the law.\\\\n    Finally, I want to sincerely thank this committee for all \\\\nof your support and for helping to strengthen CISA and by \\\\nextension, the security and resilience of the nation&#x27;s critical \\\\ninfrastructure. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n                   PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA THREATS\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, ma&#x27;am. Ranking Member, Mr. Cuellar, \\\\nthe floor is yours for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Let&#x27;s talk about the PRC threats again. Director Wray&#x27;s \\\\nrecent testimony and public comments about the PRC capabilities \\\\nand intentions, as you mentioned, are quite alarming.\\\\n    We are also aware of the Chinese Communist Party interest \\\\nin Taiwan, and, of course, importantly, to make sure that we \\\\nlook at how they want to prevent us from getting involved.\\\\n    From CISA&#x27;s perspective and recognize some of this might be \\\\nclassified. So let&#x27;s talk about only what you can talk about. \\\\nCan you talk about those threats and capabilities you see \\\\ncoming from China and how those intentions threaten us here, \\\\nspecifically in the United States?\\\\n    You mentioned some of those things, but could you add any \\\\nfurther examples?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Absolutely, Ranking Member.\\\\n    You know, we&#x27;ve long been focused on cyber threats. \\\\nTypically, it&#x27;s been about data theft, intellectual property \\\\ntheft, and espionage. And over the past year, we have seen this \\\\nevolution for pre-positioning into critical infrastructure \\\\nspecifically for disruption and destruction.\\\\n    That is the real difference here. And this is not an intel \\\\nassessment. This is a threat that we have actually found \\\\nthrough our hunting teams. We have eradicated and evicted these \\\\nChinese cyber actors in multiple sectors, as I mentioned; \\\\nwater, power, energy, transportation.\\\\n    But we believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg. \\\\nAnd so we are working with critical infrastructure owners and \\\\noperators, across the country, to make sure that they \\\\nunderstand this threat, that they can identify and detect this \\\\nthreat in their network, and that they can put in place \\\\nmitigations that can allow them to reduce the risk of potential \\\\nmass disruption.\\\\n    A couple things, if I can take the time. It&#x27;s really \\\\nimportant for any constituents of yours. We need to make sure \\\\nthat if there is a cyber incident, that they are reporting it \\\\ninto CISA. We actually just launched an easy to remember 1-844-\\\\nSAY-CISA for anybody who wants to report an incident. Also, we \\\\nthink it&#x27;s very important that anybody across America \\\\nestablishes a relationship with their CISA field force.\\\\n    We&#x27;re very proud of how we&#x27;ve grown that capability and to \\\\nensure that they are taking advantage of our vulnerability \\\\nscanning, our cyber performance goals, and improving their \\\\nresilience.\\\\n    This is the most serious threat to our Nation that I have \\\\nseen in more than 30 years in the U.S. Government. And it&#x27;s \\\\nabsolutely critical that our critical infrastructure owners and \\\\noperators, businesses small and large, take it seriously, and \\\\nCISA is ready to stand in and help.\\\\n\\\\n                          RESOURCE LIMITATIONS\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. With the current resource limitations, I am \\\\nvery concerned about your agency&#x27;s capacity to defend against \\\\nthe threats that you just mentioned, especially when you said, \\\\nit is only the tip of an iceberg.\\\\n    What additional resources do you need to be successful in \\\\nthese efforts beyond what is in the budget request?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Well, we, of course, support the President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget, Ranking Member.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. That is the standard line.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. But?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Of course, we can do more with more. As you \\\\nrecall, we talked about this earlier, and very helpfully, there \\\\nwas a layout of about $150 million more dollars that would \\\\nallow us to do three things.\\\\n    The first one would be to continue to build on that Cyber \\\\nSentry capability, which is really best in class and can be \\\\ndeployed at the most important critical infrastructure owners \\\\nso that we can detect and prevent significant damage to the \\\\ninfrastructure that we believe Chinese cyber actors are going \\\\nafter. So that&#x27;s one category.\\\\n    Two, to increase our capacity to be able to hunt. So our \\\\nhunt teams, as I mentioned, 97 engagements on domestic \\\\ninfrastructure in fiscal year 2023. But we can do more with \\\\nmore.\\\\n    And then finally, to continue to grow our field force. I&#x27;m \\\\nvery proud that since 2021, we&#x27;ve grown by almost 1,700 people, \\\\nand a lot of that is in the field. But we need to continue to \\\\ngrow our cybersecurity advisors, our physical security \\\\nadvisors, to enable us to help the small and medium businesses, \\\\nthe critical infrastructure owners and operators that are under \\\\nduress from these very serious nation state threats.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. As a sportsman, I appreciate you using the \\\\nword hunters, hunters to find those threats, because, again, \\\\nsome of them, like you mentioned, are deep somewhere else.\\\\n    Finally, my last question. How big of a role do you see mis \\\\nand disinformation campaigns playing in the PRC&#x27;s overall \\\\nstrategy?\\\\n\\\\n                         ELECTION INTERFERENCE\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. So we know, based on the intelligence \\\\ncommunity&#x27;s annual threat assessment, that foreign actors are \\\\nincreasingly interested in going after the U.S. in a variety of \\\\nways, in particular in our elections for interference, for \\\\ninfluence, for manipulation. It&#x27;s China, it&#x27;s Russia, it&#x27;s \\\\nIran. And this is a real concern of the state and local \\\\nelection officials that we work with.\\\\n    What we are doing to be helpful, is we are providing \\\\ninformation about tactics that our foreign adversaries use to \\\\ntry and influence elections so that election officials \\\\nunderstand these tactics and what they can do. We&#x27;re updating \\\\nour rumor versus reality website to provide accurate \\\\ninformation about election infrastructure security. Most \\\\nimportantly, though, we are amplifying the voices of trusted \\\\nelection officials across the country to ensure that citizens \\\\nknow who to go to if they have any questions about election \\\\nsecurity or about voting matters, so they can go to those \\\\nelection officials. And so that&#x27;s how we&#x27;re supporting them. To \\\\ndeal with foreign malign influence operations from China and \\\\nother adversaries.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you. Well, we certainly want to be \\\\nsupportive.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Director.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Rutherford, you are \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes for your questions.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you \\\\nDirector, for being here. It is great to see you again.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. You too, Sheriff.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. And I want to talk a little bit about what \\\\nyou do locally for folks, because I think that is important to \\\\nget out understanding that everyone is familiar with the hacks \\\\nat government facilities and those kind of things.\\\\n    But fact of the matter is, a lot of the infrastructure \\\\nthat&#x27;s being attacked, as everyone knows, is really more \\\\nprivately held pipelines like Colonial and JBS Meads and some \\\\nof these other facilities, but our hospitals and all of these \\\\nother locations.\\\\n    And now one that I had never thought about is our vehicles. \\\\nOur vehicles are actually collecting data as they are driving \\\\ndown the street. In fact, China now becoming the largest \\\\nvehicle exporter, including into the United States.\\\\n    Are we working with those importers of cars to make sure \\\\nthat we are not bringing in a Trojan horse, so to speak, that \\\\ncould endanger some of our infrastructure?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. So in the National Security Memorandum that \\\\nwas published this morning, it really reinforces CISA&#x27;s role in \\\\ncross-sector risk management, because as you point out, \\\\nSheriff, this infrastructure, everything we rely upon is \\\\ndigitized, and everything has these very complicated supply \\\\nchains.\\\\n    So we need to work across all sectors, including technology \\\\nsectors, to ensure we can drive down that risk, particularly \\\\nthe risk of foreign intrusions into our networks.\\\\n\\\\n                             AUTO INDUSTRY\\\\n\\\\n    With respect to the auto industry in particular, we&#x27;re \\\\ndoing three things. We&#x27;re working with a variety of auto \\\\nmanufacturers to ensure that they know how to leverage CISA&#x27;s \\\\ncapabilities to do vulnerability disclosure. That&#x27;s very \\\\nimportant. We&#x27;re also working on potential risks from electric \\\\nvehicles, like malware being in certain parts of that supply \\\\nchain, just as you pointed out. And then, we&#x27;re of course \\\\nworking with the Auto-ISAC, and they put out a lot of good \\\\ninformation. We&#x27;re sharing information from them, and we&#x27;re \\\\npart of their conferences on best practices. And so we&#x27;re \\\\ncontinuing to evolve that capability, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. You know, the Chinese are now requiring, in \\\\nChina, that all of the information collected by their vehicles, \\\\nwhether they are from America or internally, that all of that \\\\ndata has to be locally stored, captured and locally stored. Do \\\\nwe have anything like that in America?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. No, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK.\\\\n    Do you think we should?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Well, it&#x27;s part of the challenge.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. I asked Secretary Buttigieg about this this \\\\nmorning.\\\\n    And I know we have reached out to DoD and Department of \\\\nCommerce about these issues as well. But I was just curious if \\\\nyour agency has any intent to look at that as a requirement, \\\\npossibly by some of these people?\\\\n    Maybe that&#x27;s better for the Department of Commerce. I don&#x27;t \\\\nknow.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir, I&#x27;m happy to follow up on that. You \\\\nknow, everything that we do, we focus very much on preserving \\\\nprivacy of data. That&#x27;s certainly not the way our adversaries \\\\nlook at it, unfortunately.\\\\n    And it&#x27;s why we&#x27;re concerned about capabilities like \\\\nTikTok, as you&#x27;re well aware.\\\\n\\\\n                             SCHOOL SAFETY\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Well, OK. Well, I&#x27;ll tell you, another area \\\\nthat I think you guys are doing just incredible work is in \\\\nschool safety.\\\\n    And I know you all have come down to my district, actually, \\\\nand helped in this regard, which I really appreciate. And I \\\\nthink the public needs to know that CISA is taking that kind of \\\\na hands-on approach at a very local level to work with small \\\\nbusinesses, work with our schools.\\\\n    And in fact, the schoolsafety.gov site that you have up, \\\\nwhich is really a kind of a repository for all these great \\\\nideas, what is some of the feedback that you are getting?\\\\n    I know some schools, the more rural schools, they have \\\\ndifficulty with implementation. They may have a great plan, \\\\nthey may get a great plan from you, but they don&#x27;t know what to \\\\ndo about it.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yeah, Sheriff, thank you for raising that. \\\\nIt&#x27;s one of the things that people don&#x27;t realize that CISA \\\\ndoes, but it&#x27;s so important. And I was down at, when we set up \\\\nschoolsafety.gov, it was after the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman \\\\nDouglas, and I was just down there to visit the school.\\\\n    So it&#x27;s been around for 6 years, but we have \\\\nschoolsafety.gov, which is basically a clearinghouse for so \\\\nmuch information, physical security, cybersecurity, to help \\\\nprotect both teachers and students.\\\\n    And we have been engaging with hundreds of communities \\\\nacross the country to ensure that they&#x27;re aware of all of these \\\\nno-cost resources, which include, really helpfully, a grant \\\\nfinder tool, so they know how they can take advantage of these \\\\ngrants that are sometimes difficult to navigate if you&#x27;re a \\\\nless resourced entity across the country.\\\\n    We just had our second annual school safety summit, 8,000 \\\\npeople sharing ideas. We&#x27;re using the funding that we have for \\\\nschool safety to enable us to build the clearinghouse, add on \\\\nadditional guidance, and make sure that we can keep our kids \\\\nand our educators safe across the nation.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you very much. I see my time is up. I \\\\nwill tell you, though, I have a bill coming forward. It is Plan \\\\nfor School Safety Act, which will actually help set up School \\\\nSafety Development Centers where give you kind of a common \\\\npoint of contact with some localities.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Fantastic.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you very much for all you are doing.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Thanks, Sheriff.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Underwood, \\\\nyou are recognized, for your questions.\\\\n\\\\n                             PSA EXPANSION\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Hi, Director Easterly. It is good to see you. Over the last \\\\nfew years, I have been grateful for your partnership, as we \\\\nhave worked to improve and expand the role of the protective \\\\nsecurity advisers or PSAs at CISA. In addition to serving as \\\\nlocal experts on critical infrastructure protection and helping \\\\nour communities respond to threats, the PSAs can help expand \\\\naccess to federal resources by conducting security assessments \\\\nthat are required to apply for the nonprofit security grant \\\\nfunding from DHS. And since this funding is one of the best \\\\nways for schools and places of worship and other community \\\\ncenters to get federal funding for their physical security at a \\\\ntime when Islamophobic and antisemitic threats are on the rise, \\\\nPSAs are more important than ever.\\\\n    Director Easterly, can you share an update on CISA&#x27;s work \\\\nto expand and improve the availability of PSAs to communities \\\\nlike mine? And how would this year&#x27;s budget request be used to \\\\nsupport this work?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yeah, thanks so much, Congresswoman. And I \\\\nknow my team in your district loves working with you and your \\\\nteam.\\\\n    So it is one of those things that people do not necessarily \\\\nthink about when you think about CISA, but we have an amazing \\\\ncadre of Protective Security Advisers who have been around for \\\\na long time, who comes from the community, who work with the \\\\ncommunity. And so we are excited to be able to continue to grow \\\\nand strengthen. As I mentioned, we have grown our field force \\\\nby 35 percent. We have been able to quadruple the number of \\\\nengagements. And so working in districts to be able to reduce \\\\nrisk, and this is across the board, physical security, for \\\\nexample you mentioned some of the Islamophobia, we worked very \\\\nclosely with faith-based institutions. We gave them checklists \\\\naround physical security. We created specifically physical \\\\nsecurity protective guidelines for faith-based institutions and \\\\nour folks went around the country so we could actually work in \\\\ndistricts with constituents to help them drive down risks, so I \\\\nreally appreciate you highlighting that capability.\\\\n\\\\n                        CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Thank you. Shout out to Region Five&#x27;s PSAs. \\\\nThey do a great job. Please let us know if you need additional \\\\nresources to support their great work.\\\\n    Now I want to turn to the growing digital threats posed by \\\\nforeign governments like the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is \\\\nno secret that TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is \\\\ncontrolled by the Chinese Communist Party, poses unique risk to \\\\nAmericans, and the President signed legislation this week to \\\\ntake action. This legislation passed the Congress with \\\\noverwhelming bipartisan support, but it is clear that the \\\\npublic wants and needs to hear more.\\\\n    What more can you tell us in this setting about the types \\\\nof data on American consumers that TikTok collects, and how \\\\nthat information can be used and manipulated? And how do \\\\nByteDance&#x27;s activities here differ from other major social \\\\nmedia and technology companies?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. So I think it is really important just to \\\\nfundamentally recognize that the way that China looks at data \\\\nis fundamentally different than the way we look at data. So \\\\nwhen you talk about U.S.-based social media companies, that \\\\ndata that is collected through apps like TikTok is available to \\\\nthe Chinese Government to be able to use it for whatever \\\\npurposes that they want. And that is the real worry, given the \\\\namount of data that is being collected on users here within the \\\\nU.S., and in particular children. So how that data can be used, \\\\nthere are no restrictions from the point of view of the Chinese \\\\nGovernment.\\\\n    And as we talked about earlier, this is a government that \\\\nis already burrowing deep into our U.S. domestic, civilian \\\\ncritical infrastructure with the intent to launch disruption \\\\nand destruction to incite societal panic and chaos and deter \\\\nour ability to marshal military might and citizen will in the \\\\nevent of a crisis in Taiwan. So we cannot just separate the \\\\nTikTok and ByteDance of China from the China that we know is \\\\ngoing after civilian infrastructure. We have to look at this \\\\nthreat as very connected.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Thank you. I encourage you and your partners \\\\nin the administration to do more to publicize these unique and \\\\nreal threats, including declassification where appropriate.\\\\n    Our constituents work, learn, and build community online. \\\\nAnd when major digital platforms can be coopted by a foreign \\\\nadversary, they should know what that looks like.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Our country&#x27;s critical infrastructure is at \\\\nrisk from the PRC, as you have raised, and countering that \\\\nthreat has been a major focus of this committee&#x27;s work over the \\\\nlast year. In December, I wrote to you, urging additional \\\\ninvestment from CISA to help identify, to prevent, and respond \\\\nto devastating cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure. Can you \\\\nexpand on how this budget request will help you increase the \\\\ncybersecurity defense capabilities to counter PRC threats?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, ma&#x27;am. As I mentioned, we asked for $136 \\\\nmillion more. It is largely into the cybersecurity areas, so \\\\nareas where we know that Chinese actors go after federal.gov, \\\\nwe saw major intrusions into cloud last summer. We just issued \\\\nthe Cybersafety Review Board about the security of the cloud. \\\\nSo that is one key area. The area around Volt Typhoon critical \\\\ninfrastructure, that is where we need cyber-sentry \\\\ncapabilities, hunting capabilities.\\\\n    And then, additionally, the other big area is the ability \\\\nto deploy more advisers who are doing those notifications in \\\\nevery district around the U.S. about intrusions into critical \\\\ninfrastructure. So with more, we can do more. And I am very \\\\ngrateful for the letter you sent to OMB Director Young. And it \\\\nis hugely important that we have the resources we need to \\\\ndefend the nation.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. Yes, ma&#x27;am, thanks for all you do.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Underwood. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you. The gentlelady from Iowa, Mrs. \\\\nHinson, is recognized for your questions.\\\\n\\\\n                             CYBER THREATS\\\\n\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member \\\\nCuellar. Thank you, Director Easterly, for coming before us. It \\\\nis great to work with you and great to see you again.\\\\n    And I want to actually follow up on some things my \\\\ncolleague, Ms. Underwood, was just talking about. You know, \\\\nwhen you came before the China Select Committee recently, you \\\\ndetailed some of the very, very heightened threats that we are \\\\nfacing. And I know we had a chance to talk about this. You said \\\\nnew threats are being uncovered every single day. We know that \\\\nChina and our other adversaries are continually trying to \\\\ninfiltrate our critical infrastructure, and really it is about \\\\nsowing that chaos, right, and creating that dysfunction. So we \\\\nneed to be proactive in our efforts to counter those malicious \\\\nattacks from China and our other bad actors.\\\\n    So I appreciate your efforts to specifically take on Volt \\\\nTyphoon. We know what a devastating attack that has been. You \\\\nmentioned in your opening statement some of the capabilities, \\\\nspecifically the three that you are leveraging, to really go \\\\nafter these threats, attack surface managerial service, the \\\\ncyber sentry platform, and critical infrastructure services \\\\npilot. So can you maybe detail a little bit more specifically \\\\non the attack surface management service, how that is really \\\\nhelping enhance security and resilience across the board for \\\\ncritical infrastructure?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yeah, thanks so much for asking. It is one of \\\\nthe most important new services that we have put into play over \\\\nthe last couple of years. And just to break it down, when we \\\\ntalk about Attack Surface Management, so at the end of the day, \\\\nthe critical infrastructure that we rely upon is inherently \\\\nvulnerable. So you have glitches in code, you have openings and \\\\nflaws and defects in the technology base that allows threat \\\\nactors to go in there and deploy malware, or to get in and \\\\nsteal credentials so they can take over a network.\\\\n    So what our capabilities do is they scan for these defects, \\\\nthese vulnerabilities that are exposed. In particular, if we \\\\nknow those vulnerabilities are being used by nation-state \\\\nactors or cybercriminals, and when we can see those open \\\\nvulnerabilities, we then notify that organization; you have an \\\\nexposed or unpatched vulnerability, and this is what you need \\\\nto do immediately to get it patched. As I mentioned----\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Does it usually take someone having an \\\\nexperience that is bad for you to realize that there is a \\\\nvulnerability there? Or do you have AI--I mean, what are you \\\\nusing to determine the results?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. We use various commercial capabilities to \\\\nscan for those open vulnerabilities. Typically, we try to get \\\\nto them before harm occurs. That is how we are using our pre-\\\\nransomware notification initiative. We have done that 2,054 \\\\ntimes since we launched that program. And we are preventing \\\\norganizations from getting attacked by ransomware. And I have \\\\nseen a lot of those feedback notes that say, thanks so much for \\\\nnotifying us so that we did not get attacked. And so it is all \\\\nabout managing that vulnerability surface to drive down the \\\\npropensity for attacks.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. How do you work across these platforms, and \\\\nthese three specific, to coordinate your hunting operations and \\\\nteams? How does that kind of play into that?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, thanks for asking. We have not talked a \\\\nlot about the hunt teams, but it is one of the truly world \\\\nclass capabilities that CISA has. And we have been able to \\\\nbuild that based on the budget that you have given us and the \\\\nnew authorities that we have gotten since 2021. And \\\\nessentially, these are experts that can go on working with \\\\ncritical infrastructure, and they go on a network, and they can \\\\nlook for and find evidence of intrusions. And that is where we \\\\nfound these Chinese Vault Typhoon actors. And so we have been \\\\nhunting with our critical infrastructure owners and operators \\\\npretty deliberately since the Vault Typhoon threat was \\\\ndiscovered. Frankly, as I said, you know, it is the tip of the \\\\niceberg. But just in 2023, 97 hunting engagements that have \\\\nallowed us to drive down risk. And what we do is we use those \\\\nhunting engagements, then we share what we know with our \\\\npartners, both in industry, but across the federal government. \\\\nAnd then we do advisories which can be used by the IT and \\\\nsecurity teams so they can get ahead of the threat.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Are you doing that proactively? Or you have \\\\npartners who are coming to you saying, I am opening up my \\\\nsystems, take a look? I mean, how does that relationship \\\\ndevelop?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yeah, it is a little bit of both. Typically, \\\\nwe will see that there is some sort of a vulnerability, and we \\\\nwill reach out to that critical infrastructure owner or \\\\noperator, tell them that we believe there may be intrusions, \\\\nand we will work with them to help remediate, to find and \\\\nremediate. So we try and be as proactive as possible. Because \\\\nfrankly, I think that is the only way we can get ahead of this \\\\nvery complex and dynamic threat environment.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Well, and I know my colleague mentioned the \\\\nhack that happened, or I think maybe you mentioned it, with the \\\\nCommerce secretary being intruded upon. And I think another \\\\nagency as well. So obviously, that is a huge concern, and being \\\\nproactive to go after those threats.\\\\n    And then I have very little time left. But could you \\\\nelaborate a little bit on what you are doing? You mentioned, \\\\nyou know, a 35 percent increase in your field force. What are \\\\nyou doing to really work with schools, those water facilities, \\\\nhospitals, like you mentioned?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yeah, so one of the great things about being \\\\nthe national coordinator is we are really at the center of \\\\nworking with Sector Risk Management Agencies. And at the \\\\nbeginning of 2023, I really wanted to focus on developing that \\\\nconnective tissue with other agencies, so in particular focus \\\\non water facilities with EPA, focus on hospitals with HHS, \\\\nfocus on schools with Ed. And so we worked together to do \\\\nprobably over a thousand engagements now across the country, \\\\nworking with these target-rich, cyber-poor entities, frankly, \\\\nthe ones who have been the victim of the scourge of ransomware. \\\\nAnd we have really been able to help them improve their \\\\nsecurity and resilience by putting very basic things in place, \\\\nthese no-cost services that we provide, whether that is \\\\nvulnerability scanning, whether we are doing assessments for \\\\ncyber resilience, whether it is advising them on implementing \\\\nsome of the cybersecurity performance goals that we published. \\\\nAnd so we have been able to drive down that risk. Ransomware is \\\\nstill in a pretty bad place. But I will tell you, it would be \\\\nmuch, much worse if we did not use the budget to be able to \\\\nhelp shore up some of these target-rich, cyber-poor entities \\\\nacross the country.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. Thank you, Director.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Mrs. Hinson. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Washington, Mr. Newhouse, \\\\nthe floor is yours.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Welcome, Director. Good to see you. Thank you \\\\nfor coming and visiting me in my office week before last.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. And I appreciate your offer, too, of coming \\\\nto all of our districts to help with businesses, institutions, \\\\nlearn about their vulnerabilities in cyber. So thank you for \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. So the issue of Lidar has come up today, \\\\nparticularly with cars. My understanding is that Chinese cars \\\\nare not allowed to be sold in the United States yet, but they \\\\nare working on that.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. But there are lots of other kinds of \\\\nvulnerabilities. And with the fact that Chinese law requires \\\\nall of their PRC Lidar companies, regardless of where they are \\\\noperating, to provide any available data collected by their \\\\nproducts to the CCP. So I am extremely concerned that we are \\\\npotentially giving CCP unprecedented access, not only to data \\\\non our U.S. citizens, but also sensitive data in areas of \\\\nmilitary installations or U.S. infrastructure.\\\\n    Besides cars, there are a lot of uses of this technology. \\\\nAnd I believe that almost half of the market is supplied by \\\\nChinese companies. So I guess my question surrounds what do we \\\\nneed to do in order to protect our transportation hubs, our \\\\nrail yards, our airports, our highways, our city streets, not \\\\nto mention our utilities, important pieces of, you know, \\\\ninfrastructure, power generation facilities, all that kind of \\\\nthing. Plus our military. And how does CISA leverage its attack \\\\nsurface management platform to reduce risk to all of this \\\\ncritical infrastructure?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Any ideas on what we should be proactively \\\\ndoing? Or explain to us what we already are doing and what more \\\\nwe should allow you to do.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Thank you so much. It was great to meet with \\\\nyou as well. And my team looks forward to spending time in your \\\\ndistrict.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Good.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. On the Attack Surface Management, you know, \\\\nit is all about reducing exposed vulnerabilities. But to your \\\\nreally good question about how do we deal with all this massive \\\\ncritical infrastructure? It is all underpinned by a technology \\\\nbackbone, frankly. And part of the problem is we have never \\\\ndemanded of major technology providers that they ensure that \\\\nthey are prioritizing security. The history of technology has \\\\nbeen about cool features and speed to market. And what it \\\\nreally needs to be is about putting security first.\\\\n    So one of our major, major priorities at CISA is to shift \\\\nthe burden from end users and individuals and small businesses \\\\nacross the country to the major technology providers who can \\\\nreally bear it, so that they are building and testing and \\\\ndeploying and delivering technology that is secure by design. I \\\\nthink that is the best thing we can do to catalyze----\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Require that? Require it?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, require it. Yes, sir.\\\\n    And right now, it is not. So CISA is not a regulator. We \\\\nare not a law enforcement agency, of course. But what we are \\\\ndoing is building those best practices. We use the \\\\ncybersecurity performance goals to articulate the right \\\\nstandards for cybersecurity for both information technology and \\\\noperational technology. But at the end of the day, we need some \\\\nsort of minimum standards, and that is one of the points that \\\\nwas articulated in the NSM this morning.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate that.\\\\n    This is not tongue in cheek, but have you discovered any \\\\nChinese-produced technology that is not a cyber risk?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. I would have to say no to that. But I could \\\\ngo back and get you a more comprehensive answer.\\\\n    I think just broadly, we have to assume from everything \\\\nthat we are seeing, that there is a very serious risk from \\\\nChinese cyber actors, and we need to be very mindful of that \\\\nwhen we are building and deploying and using technology \\\\ninfrastructure.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Good. Well, again, Director, thank you for \\\\nbeing with us. Appreciate it, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Harris, the \\\\nfloor is yours for questions.\\\\n\\\\n                          CENSORSHIP CONCERNS\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Thank you very much. And I want to thank the \\\\ndirector for being here again this year.\\\\n    Now last year, I think when I spoke with you last year, I \\\\nwas a little worried about censorship, especially with regard \\\\nto elections. And it has been kind of a busy year for CISA with \\\\nregards to the federal courts, I guess. Because last October in \\\\nthis Washington Post story, it says that the U.S. Circuit Court \\\\nfor the Fifth Circuit--Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \\\\nruled that the key cybersecurity defense agency, which I think \\\\nthey were talking about your agency, probably violated the \\\\nfirst amendment.\\\\n    Do you agree with the court&#x27;s decision? Or do you stand by \\\\nthat you think the courts got it wrong on this?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Thanks for the question, Dr. Harris. I \\\\nbelieve the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on this. But let \\\\nme just be very clear, and I appreciate you asking, CISA does \\\\nnot censor, has never censored, does not facilitate censorship, \\\\nand any claims of that are patently false.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. So you think the court got it wrong. All right. \\\\nWell, we will see. I guess the Supreme Court will have to rule \\\\non that. But a three-judge panel, I think it was unanimous, \\\\ndecided that you in fact were violating the first amendment.\\\\n    Now, CISA, my understanding is that--and this is from a \\\\nJune 26 press release--that CISA--not from you--that CISA moved \\\\nits censorship operation to a CISA-funded nonprofit after CISA \\\\nand the Biden administration were sued in federal court, \\\\nimplicitly admitting that its censorship activities are \\\\nunconstitutional.\\\\n    What are some of these CISA-funded nonprofits?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. I have no idea what you are asking about. The \\\\nallegations against the agency are riddled with factual \\\\ninaccuracies and do not reflect CISA&#x27;s nonpolitical mission of \\\\nprotecting our nation&#x27;s infrastructure.\\\\n    And, you know, frankly at a time when the U.S. faces \\\\nunrelenting threats to America, I would hope that CISA&#x27;s \\\\nmission would not be undermined by political, partisan \\\\npurposes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Well, look, I could not agree with you more. We \\\\nare actually under some pretty significant cyber threats. So I \\\\ndo not know why CISA spends its time collaborating with private \\\\ncompanies to basically censor Americans.\\\\n    I mean, look, that is what the Fifth Circuit Court said. I \\\\nknow you disagree.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. We do not. We do not. Just to be clear.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Well, the Fifth Circuit was pretty clear that--\\\\n--\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. The Supreme Court put a stay on the \\\\ninjunctions.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Now, Director, the Supreme Court has not ruled. \\\\nThe highest Federal court opinion, will you agree, was that \\\\nyour agency probably violated the first amendment. Am I \\\\nmisrepresenting the highest court that has ruled on this?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. I would agree that the highest court put a \\\\nstay on the injunction until they rule on it.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. And you understand, of course, that stays--and \\\\nyour background is not as a lawyer. Mine is not, either. But \\\\nyour understanding is that a stay is not the same as a ruling; \\\\nis that right?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. That is my understanding.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK. That is what I thought.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. To be clear, CISA does not censor, has never \\\\ncensored, does not facilitate censorship. I just want to be \\\\nvery, very clear about that.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Now, CISA defines mal-information as anything, \\\\nquote, based on fact but used out of context to mislead, harm, \\\\nor manipulate. Is that correct? I take it that must be from \\\\nyour website or something you published. Or you can define mal-\\\\ninformation. Is that a correct definition of mal-information?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Sure.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. So you think that mal-information, so something \\\\nthat is based on fact, should somehow be--and I will use the \\\\nterm censored. You think that something based on fact, a \\\\ngovernment agency should be allowed to comment on whether or \\\\nnot it is used out of context to mislead, harm, or manipulate? \\\\nBecause context is actually kind of a subjective decision, \\\\nwould you not agree? I mean, fact is not subjective. Facts are \\\\nfacts. But context is kind of subjective, is it not?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yeah, because I know you mean, you know, to \\\\nprotect the nation, sir. So to be very clear of CISA&#x27;s role, \\\\nbecause I know you would want us to be doing this. There are \\\\nforeign adversaries who want to influence, who want to \\\\nmanipulate, who want to interfere with elections. Election----\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Excuse me, and I am just going to interrupt. So \\\\nyou only deal with foreign adversaries when you are talking \\\\nabout election mal-information?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. We do not even deal with them. Election \\\\nofficials have asked us to help them with this issue. We do \\\\nthree things: we work with the intelligence community to \\\\narticulate foreign tactics of manipulation and disinformation, \\\\nwe talk about accurate information on election infrastructure, \\\\nand we amplify the voices of election officials who are the \\\\ntrusted subject matter experts.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. So with regards to the elections, my \\\\nunderstanding is that CISA in fact in the past has pointed out \\\\nsome potential problems with mail-in voting, but then suggested \\\\nthat posts about problems with mail-in voting might be \\\\ndisinformation or misinformation. Is that true?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. I am not familiar with that. I am happy to \\\\nfollow up on that.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. I will get you the details.\\\\n    And finally, I see my time has run out, but I do, following \\\\nup on the China threats, you know, in agriculture, obviously \\\\nDJI is a maker of most of the drones. They fly over some pretty \\\\nsensitive areas that are adjacent to Defense facilities, for \\\\ninstance. And I would hope that we are looking carefully as to \\\\nwhether or not we are losing critical information. And I would \\\\nrather you spent your time on that than election integrity.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Do you have a response to that?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. I do. Thank you.\\\\n    We are working in your district, by the way, and really \\\\nenjoying it. We do notifications to prevent businesses from \\\\nbeing attacked by ransomware. We are working with one of the \\\\nlargest health providers in your district. So it might be \\\\nuseful to talk to some of them. And I would love to come to \\\\nyour district and do a community roundtable with respect to \\\\nsupport state and local election officials who are on the front \\\\nlines of defending democracy.\\\\n    At the end of the day, that is $48 million in our $3 \\\\nbillion budget. So you can rest assured that our focus is on \\\\nthe most serious threats to the United States of America.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Cloud, is \\\\nrecognized for questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Hello, Director. And good to see you again. \\\\nThanks for stopping by the office.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yeah, my pleasure. Thanks for the great \\\\nconvo.\\\\n\\\\n                              SOCIAL MEDIA\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. I was going to ask a number of the questions \\\\nthat Dr. Harris has asked. But I will just point out that last \\\\nyear, when you were before this committee, you said to me, just \\\\nto be totally crystal clear, as I think you want me to be, we \\\\ndo not censor anything, we do not flag anything to social media \\\\norganizations at all.\\\\n    It seemed to me with much--there has been much ado about \\\\nthis--that maybe we were arguing over maybe the definition of \\\\nwhat is is. But it seems like your testimony today is that CISA \\\\nhas never worked with, coordinated with third party \\\\ninstitutions or groups to have any sort of influence at all in \\\\nsocial media companies. Is that your testimony?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Thank you for asking, because it is good for \\\\nus to be able to talk publicly about this. So on the substance \\\\nof the issue, just to be very clear, in 2018 and 2020, so \\\\nbefore I was the director, actually under the oversight of the \\\\nlast administration, based on asks from state and local \\\\nelection officials, CISA took information from election \\\\nofficials who were worried about foreign activity, saying \\\\nthings like this election, the election polling place is here \\\\nnot there, or it is closed. They would take that information \\\\nand forward it to social media companies, not telling them what \\\\nto do, not saying to take it down, not encouraging them to do \\\\nanything, other than this is information from a state and \\\\nlocal--by the way, of both parties across the country. We \\\\npassed it to those social media companies, again, before I got \\\\nhere, 2020. And we said, do with it what you will.\\\\n    Now, that happened 200 times. And when I came in, I said, \\\\nthis is really not worth resources to be passing information. \\\\nAnd so we stopped the program. But again, that occurred under \\\\nthe oversight, in the last administration, and we are not doing \\\\nit under my leadership.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Why would the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals say \\\\nthis? It said, CISA was the primary facilitator of the FBI&#x27;s \\\\ninteractions with social media platforms and worked in close \\\\nconnection with the FBI to push the platforms to change their \\\\nmoderation policies over hack and leak content. Now, hack and \\\\nleak content was referring specifically to the Hunter Biden \\\\nlaptop from hell, which some have labeled foreign information. \\\\nSo I am not sure, when you are sitting here saying, oh, well, \\\\nwe are dealing with foreign information, that you are not \\\\ntalking about--about this.\\\\n    It seems like the court had done a lot of due diligence----\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. CISA played no role, had nothing to do with \\\\nthe Hunter Biden laptop. And the allegations of CISA censoring \\\\nanything are patently false. The allegations are riddled with \\\\nfactual inaccuracies.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. We have your testimony. It is on record, it is \\\\nunder oath. We will move on.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Wonderful. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. You are familiar with Executive order 14019 \\\\ndealing with elections?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. I think that is on voting access, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Yes. Have you presented your report as required \\\\nby the--it says, within 200 days of the date of this order, the \\\\nhead of each agency shall submit to the assistant president for \\\\ndomestic policy a strategic plan. Have you submitted your \\\\nstrategic plan?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. No. And we would be very--I will go back and \\\\nget the specifics but----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. Do you think the executive order is not valid? \\\\nIs that why?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. We do infrastructure, election infrastructure \\\\nsecurity. So we would not have a role in that specifically. So \\\\nI am pretty sure we did not submit anything on that. But I am \\\\nhappy to go back and verify that. Because election \\\\ninfrastructure security is what we do. We do not do things like \\\\nvoting access, and we do not have expertise in that area, \\\\neither.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. And yet there was a FOIA request, there was a \\\\nFOIA request after this deadline that was not replied to, is my \\\\nunderstanding. So that would be good news to hear. We will \\\\ndouble check on that and make sure that is happening.\\\\n    I do want to touch on one topic we talked about, and of \\\\ncourse that is China. The question I had asked you in the \\\\noffice was whether this was coming from people hacking in \\\\noverseas or whether it was domestic. And what was your answer?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. So what the Chinese cyber actors are using is \\\\na series of obfuscated infrastructure to be able to jump into \\\\nour domestic civilian infrastructure. So it is coming overseas \\\\nbut going through a series of layered infrastructure and taking \\\\nadvantage of the defects and the flaws and the inherent \\\\ninsecurities in that civilian critical infrastructure.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. OK. Yesterday when I asked you about this, you \\\\nsaid that they were--I said, are they here or are they overseas \\\\nhacking in? And you said that they are here, they are taking \\\\nadvantage of like home networks, home routers and the like.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. So are they here or are they----\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. They are hacking from China into U.S. \\\\ncritical infrastructure. When I was talking about the small \\\\noffice, home office routers, essentially they are open access \\\\npoints because there is very insecure technology. And so they \\\\nare jumping from one layer of infrastructure onto these small \\\\noffice, home office routers that are very insecure, and then \\\\nusing them as a launch point into our civilian critical \\\\ninfrastructure. So of course they are coming from China because \\\\nthey are Chinese cyber actors----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. That is specifically the question I asked you \\\\nyesterday and I got a different answer----\\\\n    Ms. Easterly [continuing]. Onto our--yes, you asked me \\\\nwhether they are here, and as I said----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. So are the people here or are they overseas? I \\\\nsaid, are they overseas hacking into it, or are they here \\\\nwithin our institutions----\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Hackers--hackers are coming from China. They \\\\nare on our civilian critical infrastructure. And it is not like \\\\npeople are on it. It is----\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. I understand that.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. But the question is, were they domestic here \\\\ninside the institutions working to hack? Are they neighbors? \\\\nSpecifically, the example we talked about was like being close \\\\nto one of these routers and being able to hack in and----\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Hackers are overseas, coming into our \\\\ncivilian infrastructure, which does not make it any better, I \\\\nthink.\\\\n    Mr. Cloud. OK, thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you. I am going to do something very \\\\nunusual now. I am going to recognize myself for a couple of \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. I want to follow up a little bit, and I just \\\\nwant to plant the question, I do not expect you to--but when \\\\nyou talk about election infrastructure, and some of us are \\\\nfamiliar with the plan from the United States Postal Service to \\\\ndo their new plan, whatever they call it, blah, blah, blah, \\\\nwhich in many instances involves the transportation of those \\\\nStates that have mail-in ballots across State lines in the \\\\ntraditional fashion. I do not know whether that falls into your \\\\nbailiwick. But I would like you to see what, if any, \\\\nprecautions are being taken to treat mail-in ballots \\\\ndifferently than mail in that plan, if there is any provision. \\\\nOr if that falls outside of your jurisdiction, if you could \\\\nadvise who you think&#x27;s jurisdiction it falls inside? And so \\\\nthat is for another day. But I would appreciate you guys kind \\\\nof leaning into that.\\\\n    This morning, the administration released the National \\\\nSecurity Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure, Security and \\\\nResilience. You have mentioned it in your comments. What new \\\\naction does this require of CISA on top of what you are already \\\\ndoing, as you have kind of described here today. What does that \\\\nchange as a result of that being released here today, in your \\\\nview?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir. And to your first point, I will get \\\\nback to you on that. We do work with the U.S. Postal Service. \\\\nIn particular, we just put out a product about safety of mail \\\\nhandling of ballots, because there have been some fentanyl that \\\\nhas been found in local election offices, unfortunately. And we \\\\nwant to make sure that these mail handlers who are dealing with \\\\nballots are safe and secure. But I will get back to you with \\\\nyour specific question.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. That would be great. And thank you for that. \\\\nBut to refine that a little bit, it is--is what you have been \\\\nworking on with them reflected in this new plan?\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Fentanyl or otherwise. Since I do not think \\\\nballots are just, hey, regular, yee-haw, vanilla mail.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, sir, I will get back to you on that, \\\\nChairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. On the NSM in particular, so what I think is \\\\nreally notable about this is the last time a presidential \\\\npolicy directive on critical infrastructure was published was \\\\nin 2013, before CISA was even thought of. And the threat \\\\nenvironment was very different. It was about terrorism. Now we \\\\nare looking at physical threats, but also cyber threats, and \\\\nthe threat landscape is very different.\\\\n    So what this National Security Memorandum does most \\\\nimportantly is to recognize now we are in a world of high \\\\ndependencies, high digitization, high vulnerabilities, and you \\\\ncannot just manage by sector. And this was very glaringly \\\\nobvious to me in my last job, where I was at Morgan Stanley as \\\\nthe head of resilience. We could spend billions of dollars to \\\\nshore up our infrastructure, but we were dependent on power and \\\\nwater and communications. And so really, it is all about how \\\\nyou manage cross-sector risk.\\\\n    And so CISA&#x27;s role is the national coordinator for critical \\\\ninfrastructure security and resilience, working with industry, \\\\nworking with Sector Risk Management Agencies to drive down risk \\\\nthrough the delivery of no-cost voluntary services, training, \\\\nassessment, exercises. And information and technical data is \\\\nreally important to being able to protect the United States of \\\\nAmerica from the myriad of threat actors, China preeminently, \\\\nbut also Russia and Iran and North Korea, and the \\\\ncybercriminals who are wreaking havoc on our hospitals and our \\\\nschools and our water facilities.\\\\n    So I welcome the opportunity to put this into place in the \\\\ncoming year. And it is one of the reasons why we have asked for \\\\nan increase in our budget so we can effectively manage this \\\\ncross-sector risk from a variety of very serious threats, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you. And just one more follow-up. A \\\\ncouple of weeks ago or whatever it was, there was a hack into a \\\\nhealth care clearing network or, you know, do not laugh at me--\\\\n--\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Change Healthcare.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. When you are basically--when we are looking at \\\\nthe budget, if you could identify, just a follow-up, here is \\\\nthe stuff, since it is obviously infrastructure, the health \\\\ncare, what we learned from that, blah, blah, blah, and without \\\\ntelling any secrets, but basically kind of say, this is part of \\\\nthe increase, if it is in fact the case, in terms of trying to \\\\ncheck that health care box to make sure that we are paying \\\\nappropriate attention as a result of what happened there. Which \\\\nI think was illegal, but your information is probably better.\\\\n    Ms. Easterly. Yes, we would be happy to get back to you. It \\\\nwas a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, significant \\\\ncascading impacts across the nation. And we have been working \\\\nvery closely with HHS to ensure that we can help a lot of these \\\\ninfrastructure providers in the health care world, to include \\\\nthe lesser resourced ones, like rural hospitals, that they have \\\\nthe resources they need to be able to drive down risk. And we \\\\nneed to do more of that, as you said. So thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to drill down in that with the committee.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Yes, ma&#x27;am. And members, if you have further \\\\nquestions, please get them submitted expeditiously to the \\\\ndirector so that we can ask her to expeditiously respond to \\\\nthose in the timeline.\\\\n    Thank you, Madam Director, for your appearance today and \\\\nyour preparedness. And we are going to go ahead and adjourn the \\\\nsubcommittee.\\\\n    [Questions and answers submitted for the record follow:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n                                            Wednesday, May 1, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n                       UNITED STATES COAST GUARD\\\\n\\\\n                                WITNESS\\\\n\\\\nADMIRAL LINDA L. FAGAN, COMMANDANT, U.S. COAST GUARD\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. We will call this meeting of the House \\\\nAppropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee to order.\\\\n    I am going to, as usual, skip my opening remarks. And also, \\\\nin a phenomenal display of wild, rampant bipartisanship, my \\\\nranking member, the gentleman from Texas, has decided to see \\\\nhow that works for him. He is going to skip his opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    So, Madam Commandant, the floor is yours for your opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Thank you. Good morning. Chair Amodei, \\\\nRanking Member Cuellar, distinguished members of the \\\\nsubcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today, \\\\nand I ask that my written testimony be entered into the record.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. So ordered.\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Thank you.\\\\n    On behalf of the service, I&#x27;d like to thank you for your \\\\ncontinued support of the Coast Guard, our workforce, and our \\\\nfamilies. With the funding provided in 2024 appropriation, we \\\\ncan make progress on recapitalization of critical assets, \\\\ncontinue key sustainment and mission readiness efforts, and \\\\nsupport and grow our total workforce.\\\\n    The Coast Guard continues to deliver world class, multi-\\\\nmission safety, security, and stewardship across many missions, \\\\nfrom protecting the safety of life at sea to securing the \\\\nmarine transportation system.\\\\n    However, to meet rising mission demands, we must invest in \\\\n2025 and beyond to generate sustained workforce and mission \\\\nreadiness and resilience while building the Coast Guard of the \\\\nfuture.\\\\n    Our workforce remains my highest priority. We&#x27;re \\\\ntransforming our talent management system so we can recruit and \\\\nretain the best people and empower them to be ready for \\\\ntomorrow&#x27;s challenges.\\\\n    In the last year, our workforce has adopted to growing \\\\nmission demand and responded to my focus on service culture. We \\\\nwill continue to work together to strengthen a workplace \\\\nclimate aligned with our core values, and that is what every \\\\nmember of the Coast Guard deserves.\\\\n    Funding requested in FY 2025 will build on our current \\\\nefforts to foster new initiatives and policy changes that \\\\nstrengthen protective factors and improve the workplace \\\\nexperience our people have in the Coast Guard, and your support \\\\nis crucial.\\\\n    I ask for your help to ensure our workforce is ready to \\\\nmeet mission requirements. Demand for Coast Guard missions has \\\\nnever been higher, and we must continue to adapt to an evolving \\\\nglobal security environment and a rapidly changing U.S. marine \\\\ntransportation system.\\\\n    To respond to mounting demands and remain mission ready the \\\\nCoast Guard needs your support. Our maintenance budget does not \\\\ncover our planned asset maintenance projects next year. As we \\\\nfield the more complicated and technologically advanced assets \\\\nrequired to meet mission demands facing future fleet, we are \\\\nfocused on properly identifying maintenance needs in our \\\\nbudget.\\\\n    The $30 million request in service system sustainment is an \\\\nimportant first step towards those maintenance goals. The \\\\nservice needs increased and reliable funding for our many high \\\\npriority acquisition programs to ensure the service can sustain \\\\nour ships, aircraft, and shore infrastructure.\\\\n    I look forward to working with you to ensure we remain \\\\nready for the future challenges we face as a service and the \\\\nnation faces. Thank you and I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Admiral.\\\\n    The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes for \\\\nyour questions.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you so much \\\\nfor being here, Admiral.\\\\n    I am supportive of the administration&#x27;s increasing focus on \\\\nChina and glad the Coast Guard is going to play a key role. I \\\\nbelieve the Coast Guard&#x27;s presence, for example, in the Taiwan \\\\nStrait and the South China Sea, and your work with the \\\\nPhilippine Coast Guard, are important steps to make sure that \\\\nwe send out the strong message that the U.S. is committed to a \\\\nfree and open Indo-Pacific.\\\\n    Can you talk further about what you are doing in that \\\\nregion? In particular, what drives the need for the Coast \\\\nGuard&#x27;s presence versus some other military assets in the area \\\\nthat you are at and what the $263 million in the budget request \\\\nwill be used for?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Thank you. Our role in the Pacific is \\\\ncritical. We are a Pacific nation and the Coast Guard has \\\\noperated in the Pacific for as long as we&#x27;ve been a coast \\\\nguard.\\\\n    The budget support and the budget ask is for additional \\\\nfast response cutters that will increase presence and capacity \\\\nto partner with small island nations throughout the Pacific.\\\\n    It adds capacity for training teams, liaison officers, \\\\nattaches, and mobile support, again, to partner with small \\\\nisland nations, we do a particularly good job coming to them as \\\\nthey are, to help them enforce their own sovereignty.\\\\n    Harriet Lane was on budget in a former budget year, moved \\\\nfrom the east coast of the United States to Honolulu, which is \\\\nher new home port. And she has just completed a trip through \\\\nthe Pacific that involved twelve nations.\\\\n    We leveraged eight of our bilateral agreements with those \\\\nnations, conducted boardings in those nations&#x27; exclusive \\\\neconomic zones with personnel from those nations.\\\\n    So we provided the support. The nation brings their \\\\nauthority and expertise and we reinforce those nations \\\\nsovereignty in a way that increases their capability encounters \\\\nthose that look to erode that rule of law in the region.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Now, I understand that through our maritime \\\\nborders, you are not seeing fentanyl as much as you see \\\\nmarijuana and cocaine. This substance is still dangerous and \\\\nharmful to our communities.\\\\n    Can you tell the committee a little bit about what trends \\\\nyou are seeing? Because during the southern border we are \\\\nseeing Fontenot. But it is interesting that there is a \\\\ndifferent trend during the maritime area.\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yeah, so we&#x27;re very engaged in the maritime \\\\nflows, which is primarily cocaine and marijuana. Occasionally, \\\\nwe encounter fentanyl at sea, but it is not the primary illegal \\\\nnarcotic that we encounter.\\\\n    It&#x27;s important to note that whether it&#x27;s fentanyl at the \\\\nsouthwest border or cocaine and marijuana at sea, it&#x27;s the same \\\\ncartels that are moving those illicit goods through their \\\\nillegal networks.\\\\n    And so countering the cartel broadly is important and \\\\ncritical work. We have assets in the eastern Pacific 24/7 \\\\nworking in support of JIATF South and Key West, which is a \\\\nSOUTHCOM unit.\\\\n    They do the targeting and allowing us to put that Coast \\\\nGuard cutter onto a target of interest and conduct that at-sea \\\\ninterdiction, where we then interdict the drugs, pull them onto \\\\nour vessels.\\\\n    Those are narcotics that don&#x27;t reach our shores, don&#x27;t \\\\nreach our communities, and don&#x27;t result in overdoses. And it is \\\\ncritical and ongoing work. I lead the Threat Interdiction \\\\nCommittee and that brings a broader federal government look \\\\ninto some of our counternarcotics efforts.\\\\n    And the Threat Interdiction Committee is focused on \\\\nfentanyl as well as cocaine and marijuana. And we&#x27;re engaged \\\\nbroadly across the government in those counter narcotics \\\\nefforts.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you.\\\\n    Last question, dealing with introduction of migrants. \\\\nAdmiral, as you know, we are seeing migrants cross our borders \\\\nnot only through land but through sea. Also, in some parts of \\\\nthe maritime border, we continue to see upward trends in your \\\\nnumber of apprehensions.\\\\n    Can you discuss with us the current trends and the \\\\nchallenges that you are seeing and what sort of resources would \\\\nbe needed to help you in your mission?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. We&#x27;re involved in the irregular maritime \\\\nmigration. This is lifesaving work. When people take to sea in \\\\nunseaworthy conveyances, the risk of loss of life is \\\\nsubstantial.\\\\n    About 18 months ago, the flows through the Caribbean and \\\\nthe Florida Straits and Windward Pass were significant. That is \\\\nnot true today. We have moved assets. We&#x27;re very visibly \\\\npresent. We&#x27;ve got unmanned systems, sail drone under contract.\\\\n    That and policy clarity has helped decrease the numbers \\\\nthat we are encountering at sea. But we remain engaged and in \\\\nposition to counter anyone that may attempt those illegal and \\\\nperilous attempts to reach our shores.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. My time is up, but can you just, I am familiar \\\\nwith sail drones, but can you explain what that is?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yes. So a said drone it is an unmanned \\\\nsystem that we have under contract. They&#x27;re built on the west \\\\ncoast of the United States. They&#x27;re fully autonomous, operated \\\\nby a command center out of the west coast.\\\\n    They have sensors, so they provide a maritime domain \\\\nawareness and create a presence. Those attempting to depart \\\\nillegally know they&#x27;re out there and work to, you know, it \\\\nhelps to prevent those departures.\\\\n    Mr. Cuellar. Thank you to you and your men and women.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. He meant to ask one more question. Is a sail \\\\ndrone waterborne or airborne?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. So it&#x27;s waterborne. It&#x27;s like a small \\\\ncatamaran, but there&#x27;s no people on them. They generate quite a \\\\nbit of interest if you see them at sea because they&#x27;re fairly \\\\nlarge, but no one&#x27;s on them.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Thank you, Mr. Cuellar, for that follow-up \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Now, in accordance with his demand to be recognized, \\\\nbecause he was present first at the meeting, Dr. Harris, the \\\\ngentleman from Maryland, the floor is yours for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Not that I agree with that characterization, but thank you \\\\nvery much.\\\\n    Admiral, I thank you again for appearing before us. You \\\\nknow, in your introduction, you mentioned that safety of life \\\\nat sea is obviously a critical mission of the Coast Guard. And \\\\nyour written testimony, you said, you know, you are responsible \\\\nfor the safety, security, and stewardship of the Nation&#x27;s \\\\nwaters.\\\\n    My particular question is about offshore wind projects off \\\\nthe coast of Maryland and other mid-Atlantic areas, because I \\\\nam worried that the Coast Guard will not be able to protect the \\\\nsafety of life at sea.\\\\n    And let me ask you a couple of questions about that. So \\\\nobviously, the Navy, actually, the DoD, DOE, FAA, NOAA, and \\\\nBOEM all had a wind turbine interference litigation working \\\\ngroup since 2014.\\\\n    Their stated mission was by 2025 to have the solution to \\\\nthe multiple kinds of radar interference caused by offshore \\\\nwind turbines. They haven&#x27;t issued a report, it is now nine \\\\nyears into it.\\\\n    So what they did is they just, you know, I guess, reissued \\\\ntheir MOU last year, but with no solutions yet. In the UK, they \\\\nhave also been working on the issues for many years. And they \\\\nhave wind farms, but they don&#x27;t have solutions either about \\\\nmitigation.\\\\n    Once they thought they had one, but after they built the \\\\nwind farm, it didn&#x27;t work. But of course, by then it is too \\\\nlate. I mean, once these wind farms are up, I mean, the Coast \\\\nGuard can&#x27;t go in and say, well, you got to stop operating them \\\\nbecause they are not safe.\\\\n    So has the Coast Guard or the Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity conducted a radar interference modeling study on the \\\\nsize and number of offshore wind farms being planned for off \\\\nour Maryland coast?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. So we are engaged in that work group across \\\\nthe broader agency. Our role in wind farms is advising on the \\\\nsafety of navigation and safety of life at sea.\\\\n    So there are impacts to wind farms. We need to ensure that \\\\nwe are actually able to rescue people should they encounter an \\\\nissue in a wind farm. We&#x27;re closely working with the entities \\\\ninvolved with regard to the radar interference, and I&#x27;m \\\\ncommitted to continuing that work.\\\\n    I understand that the timeframes have been long, but our \\\\nrole in advising, with regard to safety of navigation, we take \\\\nthat role seriously and are involved and committed to that \\\\nadvisory role as that work moves forward.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. So what have you advised? Because, you know, \\\\nthe Maryland, if it weren&#x27;t for certain circumstances that \\\\nMaryland wind farm would be built already without, I guess, \\\\nwithout Coast Guard comment on the safety, especially with \\\\nregards to search and rescue, is that a reasonable \\\\ncharacterization that the Coast Guard, in fact, has not \\\\ncommented on the safety of search and rescue based on modeling \\\\nstudies or actual studies?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. We continue to engage the process, and that \\\\nadvisory does include search and rescue and safety standoff \\\\ndistances. There&#x27;s a broad role across the North Atlantic as \\\\nwind farms are being envisioned and working through the federal \\\\nwork group to ensure that all interests are aligned and we&#x27;re \\\\nengaged in that process.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Well, I appreciate engagement in the process, \\\\nbut what we need is we need a determination because they plan \\\\nto actually plant some of these in the Atlantic.\\\\n    And people in my district are a little worried that search \\\\nand rescue would be impaired because in a letter November 25, \\\\n2019, from Captain Jennifer Williams to one of the Rhode Island \\\\nSenators basically says, and I will quote from the letter, the \\\\nstudies has--the question of the Senator, has a radar \\\\ninterference analysis been conducted? The answer includes the \\\\nstudies evaluated models or existing turbines.\\\\n    These studies indicate that radar interference can be \\\\ncaused by a number of factors, including the size, spacing and \\\\norientation of the turbines, the type and location of the \\\\nradar, radar settings, the radar operator, and atmospheric \\\\nconditions.\\\\n    So based on that, what is the Coast Guard&#x27;s opinion on the \\\\nsafety of these wind farms, with regards to interference of \\\\nradar, including high frequency radar, on search and rescue \\\\nmissions off the Maryland coast?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yeah, I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ve provided \\\\nwritten full reply. I do know that we&#x27;re 100 percent engaged in \\\\nthe process to be responsive to that particular concern, and \\\\nI&#x27;ll ask the staff to come back with the exact status of where \\\\nthat particular work group and effort is. And I understand the \\\\nconcern with regard to the windfarm development.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Sure. So there is no written reply? Is that \\\\nwhat you are----\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. If there is, I am not aware of it.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. OK. If you could get that, I would appreciate \\\\nit.\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. I will clarify that with you.\\\\n    Mr. Harris. Mr. Chair, I would ask unanimous consent to \\\\nenter that letter into the record and an article in the U.S. \\\\nNaval Institute called, offshore wind, from last year, \\\\n``Offshore Wind Energy: A Rising Challenge to Coast Guard \\\\nOperations.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    It outlines some of the problems that I do not think have \\\\nbeen addressed. Finally, in my last few----\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Without objection, so ordered.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. Harris. Thank you very much.\\\\n    And without, and again, just very briefly. I know I have \\\\nthis little area in my district called Slaughter Creek, it is a \\\\nbeautiful little area, but they have problems because the Coast \\\\nGuard puts in buoys in the summer, takes them out in the winter \\\\nand unfortunately, it&#x27;s a year-round channel.\\\\n    It will be dredged deeper because we may headquarter some \\\\nof the dredging operations so that we can keep the channel \\\\nopen. It is a very, it could be a very important port, but I \\\\nwould ask that the Coast Guard reevaluate just leaving those \\\\nbuoys in Slaughter Creed there all year-round.\\\\n    I mean, it would be a great help to my local mariners. And \\\\nwith that, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. We don&#x27;t have any of those problems in Nevada. \\\\nWe don&#x27;t allow that stuff to pop up.\\\\n    The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Iowa for \\\\nquestioning. The floor is yours.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Good morning, Admiral. Thank you so much for coming before \\\\nour committee again. I want to talk to you about a familiar \\\\nissue right in my district. Dubuque, Iowa, obviously is home to \\\\nthe Coast Guard Wyaconda cutter. The Wyaconda and its crew \\\\nreally maintain the critical operations to protect the \\\\noperations and the vitality of the upper Mississippi.\\\\n    And those cutters, like the Wyaconda, really help stabilize \\\\nthe transit shipping through our channels. Getting those \\\\nproducts to market is what we hear about all the time from our \\\\nproducers back home.\\\\n    And I mean, that really accounts for trillions of dollars \\\\nof economic activity every year and greatly benefits the state \\\\nof Iowa.\\\\n    So ensuring that the cutter and the Waterways Commerce \\\\nCutter Program is a priority going forward for the region. It \\\\nis an absolute priority for me. I hope it is a priority for \\\\nyou.\\\\n    So can you confirm that it is a top priority for you to \\\\nmaintain the Waterways Commerce Cutter Program?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. The Waterways Commerce Cutter are absolutely \\\\na priority for the Coast Guard. Some of the cutters that the \\\\nWaterway Commerce Cutter will replace are 75 plus years old. \\\\nIt&#x27;s $5.4 trillion of commerce through the inland waterways and \\\\nall of our port system. This is absolutely one of the \\\\nacquisition priorities.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. That is great, because I think we did the math \\\\non it, and the Wyaconda is almost 60 years old. So my staff had \\\\na chance to go out on it. I am hopeful I get a chance to go \\\\nvery soon to see it as well.\\\\n    While it is, let&#x27;s just say it this way, it is maintaining \\\\nits operational capacity, but it is very clear that it is an \\\\naged vessel and we need to do something there.\\\\n    So I appreciate your budget request, trying to fund two \\\\nadditional cutters, prioritizing that quick build, and of \\\\ncourse, the turnaround as well for those vessels.\\\\n    So is there a prioritization for which of those cutters \\\\nwould be subject to the replacement with additional funding? \\\\nAnd I would certainly hope the Wyaconda would be on the list.\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yeah. So the Wyaconda is on the list. There \\\\nis a prioritization. The Wyaconda is not necessarily in that \\\\nfirst tranche of cutters, but it is on the list as a priority \\\\nto be replaced.\\\\n    And, you know, we work through the decisions on how the \\\\nreplacement based on age and need. As you said, the fleet is \\\\nquite old. And so, you know, the budget request in the 2025 \\\\nBudget helps continue to build out that program of records, \\\\nprogram of record of 30, to ensure that we&#x27;re able to replace \\\\nall of those aging assets, including the Wyaconda.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. All right. Are you working with the program&#x27;s \\\\nprime contractor to keep the program moving forward? Any \\\\nintention of canceling or recompeting the contract for \\\\nWaterways Commerce Cutter?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. We are working closely with the prime \\\\ncontractor, Birdon, to recompete what would cause both cost and \\\\ntime delays. This is a critical asset and we&#x27;re committed to \\\\nthe prime contractor and moving it forward. And you see the \\\\nbudget request that reflects that.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Well, I look forward to working with you, and \\\\nagain, I hope I can get out and see it in person very soon so \\\\nwe can just check in to make sure that it is in tip top shape, \\\\nat least can get through until we can band aid it, until we can \\\\nmake it a replacement.\\\\n    Just want to get another kind of follow up to what our \\\\nranking member talked about when it comes to fentanyl and \\\\nillicit drug trafficking.\\\\n    You know, I think China is certainly trying to bypass any \\\\nlegal channels and go around ports of entry and they are trying \\\\nto strengthen their supply chains and manufacturing here.\\\\n    We had the acting commissioner from CBP yesterday. He was \\\\ntalking a little bit about China kind of working to circumvent \\\\nthese, getting around the de minimis and trying to get across \\\\nour maritime and our physical borders as well.\\\\n    So how are you really, and you mentioned, obviously, some \\\\nof the other drugs that you are trying to counter, but what are \\\\nsome of the tactics that you are taking to, to really counter \\\\nthese measures from getting into our country? And do you need \\\\nany other tools and resources to be able to maximize those \\\\nefforts?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yeah, so as I discussed, our efforts at sea, \\\\nprimarily marijuana and cocaine being interdicted, but they are \\\\nbeing moved by the same illegal cartels and organizations.\\\\n    And so countering them broadly, both at the land border, \\\\nwhich is not the Coast Guard role, but at sea, becomes \\\\ncritical.\\\\n    The Interdiction Committee, which is a broad federal \\\\ngovernment committee, works to integrate some of those both \\\\nland border focused agencies in the Coast Guard Joint \\\\nInteragency Task Force and others to ensure that we&#x27;re looking \\\\nat the problem set holistically and including fentanyl, so that \\\\nwe can work to avoid seams in our own structure, federal \\\\nstructure, with regard to counter narcotics.\\\\n    I&#x27;m looking forward to hosting that committee in Puerto \\\\nRico here shortly, where we will talk about fentanyl and other \\\\ndrug challenges that are facing the United States with regard \\\\nto illegal flows.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Are you seeing increased aggression from, I \\\\nmean, obviously, the cartel traffic is one thing. Are you \\\\nseeing any increases in other adversarial encounters? Is there \\\\nany incidence of that that your crews are seeing?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yeah, I mean, we are at sea 365, 24/7 we \\\\npretty much weekly have a narcotic--weekly or daily narcotics \\\\ninterdiction at sea. Go fast, semi-submersible, slow, fast, and \\\\nthe best strategy for that is a Coast Guard cutter with a \\\\nhelicopter that has airborne use of force and an over-the-\\\\nhorizon pursuit boat.\\\\n    And then where we have MPA, that gives us competitive \\\\nadvantage. That gives us advantage over the bad guys in the \\\\ncartel. And we continue to put that force package together to \\\\ncounter those flows at sea.\\\\n    Ms. Hinson. Well, look forward to continuing to work with \\\\nyou on that. I think this is certainly a national security \\\\nissue, and it is escalating by the day with many of our \\\\nadversaries. So thank you. Thank you, Admiral.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentlelady from Connecticut, the ranking \\\\nmember of the House Committee on Appropriations, Ms. DeLauro, \\\\nis recognized for your questions.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate \\\\nit. We are hearing hopping here today, so I appreciate your \\\\nindulgence and good to be with you, Admiral Fagan, it is great \\\\nto see you again.\\\\n    Let me thank you first for your service, and I look forward \\\\nto your, you know, your insights on several issues that are \\\\npressing. Let me start with this one. I want to address this. \\\\nIt is a difficult topic. It is the issue of sexual assault at \\\\nthe Coast Guard.\\\\n    I understand that under Operation Fouled Anchor, your team \\\\nhas conducted extensive work uncovering the abuses and that the \\\\nCoast Guard is making internal changes to address them. Can you \\\\nprovide us with any updates you might have on Operation Fouled \\\\nAnchor?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Thank you for the question. Fouled Anchor \\\\nreflects a failure of the organization to properly investigate \\\\nand support victims of assault who were at the Coast Guard \\\\nAcademy 20-plus years ago.\\\\n    This comes to light last July, and I want to assure the \\\\ncommittee that last July we were not the organization that we \\\\nwere at the time that the Fouled Anchor assaults occurred. And \\\\nwe today are not the organization that we were in July.\\\\n    After that all came to light, I directed a 90-day \\\\naccountability and transparency review. About a third of the \\\\nactions that I directed as a result of that review have been \\\\ncompleted.\\\\n    We continue to work on those action items. I get asked, \\\\nwhat&#x27;s different? What&#x27;s different today? Why is this different \\\\nfrom other times that we&#x27;ve been held accountable as an \\\\norganization for failing, with regard to sexual assault, \\\\nharassment, bullying, retaliation, retribution?\\\\n    What&#x27;s different this time is an acknowledgement that these \\\\nbehaviors are not appropriate in our service and we&#x27;re going to \\\\nmove to eradicate them. And it&#x27;s not a checklist approach. This \\\\nis how we&#x27;re going to operate the organization.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve brought in professionals to help advise. In fact, I \\\\nhave my senior leadership team in this week. We will continue \\\\nthese discussions tomorrow. We will attain the service culture \\\\nthat we strive for as an organization.\\\\n    We&#x27;re making investments in the Coast Guard Academy, \\\\ninvestments in our personnel system. I need support with an HR \\\\nIT system and look forward to working with the Committee on \\\\nwhat exactly we need to create accountability and transparency \\\\nin our HR system.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Well, thank you very, very much. And I want to \\\\nthank you for your leadership on this effort, and I am hoping \\\\nthat we can continue to receive timely updates on what&#x27;s \\\\nhappening.\\\\n    I think that that is important and it is good \\\\ncommunication. That way you can let us know what it is that you \\\\nneed from the Committee to be able to get the job done.\\\\n    We want men and women serving in an environment which is \\\\nconducive to letting them do the job and the mission that is \\\\nentrusted to them.\\\\n    While not directly in my district, one of the prides of \\\\nConnecticut is the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. Just wonderful. I \\\\nknow from talking to students at the Academy, in addition to \\\\nproviding a challenging and a rewarding academic experience, it \\\\nalso instills important values like discipline, service, and \\\\nteamwork. Lessons that pay dividends, as we know over a \\\\nlifetime.\\\\n    I want to ask specifically about facilities and \\\\ninfrastructure at the Academy. While I understand that you are \\\\nmaking many such needed improvements, there is currently a \\\\nfocus on reducing energy consumption, being more energy \\\\nefficient, making the Academy more resilient during times of \\\\nextreme weather.\\\\n    Can you talk more about the facilities at the Academy? What \\\\nmore would you hope to do if you were provided with additional \\\\nresources and how we can be helpful in that regard?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. The Coast Guard Academy is obviously \\\\ncritical to building our leadership core. Our Officer Candidate \\\\nSchool operates out of the same footprint. So really the Coast \\\\nGuard officer leaders come through that footprint in New \\\\nLondon.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve made a number of key investments. We&#x27;re making \\\\ninvestments in the barracks. Right now, we&#x27;re focused on cadet \\\\nsafety, installing cameras, key locks, ensuring that cadets \\\\nhave a safe experience while in the barracks and continue to \\\\nwork with our facilities engineers and the committee on what \\\\nthose incremental next investments are to ensure that we&#x27;ve got \\\\na safe barracks for the students and that we&#x27;ve got academic \\\\nspace that meets our needs to educate the leaders of the \\\\nfuture, nautical science labs, shipboard simulators, and look \\\\nforward to working with you with details as we phase into those \\\\ninvestments needs.\\\\n    Ms. DeLauro. Thank you very much. And again, we are anxious \\\\nto make sure that the Coast Guard has what it needs and the \\\\ncadets have what they need, both in terms of, I said that \\\\nacademic experience, but also their quality-of-life experience, \\\\nyou know, efforts and their safety. So thank you very much.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. Yes, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Rutherford, the floor is \\\\nyours for 5 minutes for questioning.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Commandant, great to see you again. I want to bring up a \\\\nquick issue about this Right Whale enforcement that NOAA is \\\\nproposing a speed rule. You know, any vessel over 35 feet would \\\\nbe required to go no more than 10 knots for about half the year \\\\nall along the eastern seaboard.\\\\n    I have heard from vessel captains, from commercial and \\\\nrecreational fishermen, from our own St. John&#x27;s River bar \\\\npilots, the dangers that this rule could create for safety of \\\\nvessels. Has the Coast Guard been involved in this, this \\\\nrulemaking?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. We are involved in the rulemaking in an \\\\nadvisory role with NOAA, and we are heavily engaged with NOAA \\\\non the rulemaking. We&#x27;ve advised on the AIS carriage \\\\nrequirements, currently set for 65 feet and greater.\\\\n    And so a reduction to 35 feet creates a number of issues \\\\nand challenges. We advise, with regard to the safety of \\\\nnavigation, the need for commerce to flow. That dialogue and \\\\nengagement is going on today, and we&#x27;ll continue to. To advise \\\\nNOAA as they work through their rulemaking process.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK, so if I understand what you just said, \\\\nAdmiral, you are opposed to the drop to 35 feet?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. I am not making a comment on the drop. I&#x27;m \\\\njust acknowledging that AIS carriage requirements are currently \\\\nset at 65 feet and above. And so there&#x27;s additional work that \\\\nwould need to be done should the length carriage be reduced.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. I will just tell you that rule will \\\\nhave devastating consequences, I think, and just want to point \\\\nthat out.\\\\n    Can we talk about your helicopter fleet for a moment? You \\\\nall have begun to transition to an all M-860 helicopter fleet, \\\\nworking with the Navy to acquire those frames.\\\\n    You guys do a great job at extending the life of these \\\\nthings. It is amazing, but there are limitations. And so I know \\\\nthat a GAO study recently came out talking about the need to \\\\nlook at a mixed fleet analysis and analysis of alternatives to \\\\ndetermine the needs for future rotary wing fleets.\\\\n    Now that this GAO study is done, it is my understanding you \\\\nall are supposed to report back to Congress an aviation \\\\nstrategy. And how long do you think it will be before that \\\\nstrategy is laid out?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. We&#x27;re aware of the requirement to do the \\\\naviation fleet mix, as you know, the 65 or the dolphin \\\\nhelicopter, we&#x27;ve extended that service life beyond service \\\\nlife that any other agency has operated the helicopter, which \\\\nis why the transition to 60&#x27;s is imperative.\\\\n    And we&#x27;re well along transitioning air stations to 60&#x27;s. \\\\nThe 2025 budget includes $168 million to continue slept on 60&#x27;s \\\\nand an additional four. We need to continue the analysis to \\\\nthen figure out what that full transition looks like and also \\\\nwhat unmanned aviation might contribute into some of that mix.\\\\n    Well, the C-27 is not a helicopter. Obviously, that was \\\\nzeroed out in the budget. A clear signal that the C-27 needs to \\\\nbe transitioned out of the fleet, opening the door and \\\\nopportunity for what is the right long-range fixed-wing, mid-\\\\nrange fixed-wing, unmanned system, and rotary wing asset \\\\nportfolio for the organization.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. And, Admiral, have you put pen to paper on \\\\nthat or pencil or paper to figure out what the cost of that is \\\\ngoing to be going forward?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. We&#x27;re working those details now. And \\\\nspecifically, in fact, we&#x27;ve just talked recently with regard \\\\nto what is the transition away from 27&#x27;s create from an \\\\nopportunity standpoint. And I know we owe a brief over here \\\\nwithin the next 30 to 45 days, and we&#x27;re planning on meeting \\\\nthat deadline.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. And those costs, are they going to \\\\ninclude, is there going to be cost to re-outfit some of the \\\\nvessel fleets to accommodate the M-860?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. The new vessels are being built--the vessels \\\\nthat are being built with flight deck capability will \\\\naccommodate a tail-fold, blade-fold 60. Some of the legacy \\\\nfleet, that is not true, but the new fleet will accommodate the \\\\nlarger helicopters.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK. And will the plan be then to retrofit \\\\nthe smaller vessels that don&#x27;t have that capacity?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. The smaller vessels that don&#x27;t have the \\\\ncapacity we&#x27;re also looking at land-based helicopter \\\\ncontributions so that, say you have a ship operating off of the \\\\nwest coast of the United States, you might need helicopter \\\\nsupport for the 60&#x27;s, have a lot more range and capability, and \\\\nso you might be able to base them ashore.\\\\n    We&#x27;re getting ready to ribbon cut on Air Station Ventura \\\\nwould be a great example of increased capability off of the \\\\nwest coast in a way that might, you know, increase that \\\\ncapacity.\\\\n    We&#x27;re looking at all that as far as how we&#x27;re operating and \\\\nhow we&#x27;re doing, how we&#x27;re working with those 60&#x27;s as we make \\\\nthat transition.\\\\n    Mr. Rutherford. OK, thank you, Commandant.\\\\n    I see my time is up. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Mississippi is recognized. \\\\nThe floor is yours for questions of the Admiral.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Admiral, thank you for being with us this morning. I want \\\\nto start off and talk about the Polar Security Cutter Program.\\\\n    As I understand, our Coast Guard currently has two \\\\nicebreakers. One, the heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star, which \\\\nis 48-years old, and the medium icebreaker Healy, which is 25-\\\\nyears old.\\\\n    We see that in a time of international uncertainty, of \\\\ngreat powers competition, if I am not mistaken, our adversary, \\\\nRussia, has approximately three dozen icebreakers and China has \\\\nincreased their fleet to four.\\\\n    First, if you can just talk generally about the importance \\\\nof increasing our icebreaker fleet. And then I want to talk a \\\\nlittle bit about the re-baselining of the current program.\\\\n    And then I have also been reading media reports about the \\\\nCoast Guard is considering purchasing an existing ship and \\\\npossibly retrofitting that as somewhat of a stopgap message or \\\\nmeasure until we can domestically once again begin producing \\\\nicebreakers here.\\\\n    So if you can just again, talk generally about the \\\\nimportance of increasing the icebreaker fleet and then get into \\\\na little bit after that about the rebase lining that&#x27;s \\\\ncurrently ongoing.\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yes. Thank you. Polar security cutter was my \\\\nfirst unit over 40-years ago, and it was not a new ship then. \\\\nWas built in the mid-seventies. And so fielding new heavy \\\\nicebreaker capacity for the Nation is critical.\\\\n    And we are on contract with Bollinger, Mississippi. I&#x27;ve \\\\nmet recently with the CEO of Bollinger to talk about how \\\\ncritical the polar security cutter is, the criticality of \\\\ngetting to detailed design, and the criticality of begin \\\\ncutting steel on that ship this calendar year.\\\\n    It will be a complicated ship to build. I&#x27;m confident in \\\\nthe design, confident in the workforce, and confident that that \\\\nshipyard will deliver that ship for the nation.\\\\n    Until we get to detailed design, we will not update the \\\\ndelivery date. That is still in the works. And it is our top \\\\npriority along with the offshore patrol cutter to ensure we \\\\nfeel that nation capacity.\\\\n    You referenced the existing icebreaker, the commercially \\\\navailable icebreaker. It&#x27;s $125 million in the FY 2024 \\\\nappropriation to purchase that as a sole source icebreaker.\\\\n    And in the 2025 UPL, there&#x27;s an additional $25 million ask \\\\nto outfit that icebreaker and bring it into initial operating \\\\ncapacity. It&#x27;s critical, as you said, this is--China&#x27;s declared \\\\nthemselves as a near arctic nation.\\\\n    The Russians obviously have their own sovereign interest on \\\\ntheir side of the Arctic. I&#x27;ve recently been at the Arctic \\\\nCoast Guard Forum and our allies and partners are also engaged \\\\nand interested in a partner.\\\\n    Actual presence is required to ensure our own national \\\\nsecurity and sovereignty in the Arctic. And that&#x27;s why the \\\\nPolar security cutter and that program becomes so critical to \\\\nus as a nation.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Let&#x27;s talk a little bit about the possible \\\\nretrofitting. You mentioned or referenced 25 million. Some of \\\\nthe things that I have read have put the cost much higher than \\\\nthat. And also the timeframe. It is somewhere between 2 to 3 \\\\nyears to actually come in and retrofit that ship.\\\\n    Which means, if that timeline is correct again, continues \\\\nto put us behind the 8 ball. Do you believe that the $25 \\\\nmillion that you referenced is an adequate amount to retrofit \\\\nthat vessel?\\\\n    Is that just a down payment and what the retrofitting cost \\\\nwill ultimately be? Can you talk a little bit about that?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yeah. The $25 million gets us to an initial \\\\noperating capacity. It&#x27;ll upgrade some of the systems, get the \\\\nship painted looking like a Coast Guard ship and an ability to \\\\nbegin to operate.\\\\n    But there will be additional needs to bring it to full \\\\noperating capacity. The timeline and the cost on that is still \\\\nuncertain. We don&#x27;t have possession of the ship. And once the \\\\nship is actually purchased, it will allow greater clarity and \\\\nwe&#x27;ll come back to the Committee with those timelines and what \\\\nthose additional costs may be associated with full operating \\\\ncapacity.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Is there money within the budget this FY 2025 \\\\nfor that retrofitting?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Not for the commercially available \\\\nicebreaker, no, just the initial operating capacity, a UPL ask.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. And then the last question is last year, Admiral \\\\nGaucher testified before Homeland Security Authorizing \\\\nCommittee, and when asked about this, he talked about the need \\\\nfor an additional eight to nine icebreakers over the next \\\\ndecade to keep us competitive.\\\\n    Do you agree that that is an accurate number? Do we need to \\\\nbe looking long term at budgeting out for an additional, in \\\\naddition to the ones that we already have budgeted, an \\\\nadditional multi-ship to build out our ice breaking capacity?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yeah. We have a high latitude analysis that \\\\nspeaks to the need for eight to nine. We do absolutely need to \\\\nbe looking long term at greater icebreaking capacity.\\\\n    We&#x27;re focused right now on a fleet of three polar security \\\\ncutters. An arctic security cutter would be a less capable \\\\nicebreaker, but all that are investments and opportunities that \\\\nthe Nation needs to consider with regard to our national \\\\nsecurity in the Arctic. And happy to share that analysis with \\\\nthe committee.\\\\n    Mr. Guest. Thank you.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. The gentleman from Washington State, Mr. \\\\nNewhouse, the floor is yours for your questions.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank \\\\nranking member of the committee as well.\\\\n    Admiral, good morning. Thanks for being with us to talk \\\\nabout the fiscal year 2025 budget proposal.\\\\n    In looking through the documents, the FY 2025 unfunded \\\\npriorities list, a couple things stood out to me. Specifically, \\\\nin the major acquisition systems infrastructure.\\\\n    First of all, the polar security cutter homeport Seattle, \\\\nmoney was requested for waterfront improvements and to prepare \\\\nthe site for three additional PSEs. And then secondly, \\\\nsomething in my district, the Waterways Commerce Cutter \\\\nhomeports money was requested to improve waterfront and \\\\nshoreside infrastructure in Kennewick, Washington.\\\\n    So a couple questions around those. What could you tell us \\\\nyour infrastructure priorities, number one? Also, why you think \\\\ninfrastructure is so critical to the health of the workforce, \\\\nparticularly in the area of retention?\\\\n    And then could you elaborate on the importance of these \\\\nparticular projects and what missions this investment will \\\\nenable? I am guessing some of the similar responses you had to \\\\nMr. Guest, but I would be interested in what you have to say.\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. The infrastructure investment, shoreside \\\\ninfrastructure, peers, shore ties, maintenance buildings, \\\\ngalleys, the types of things that support ships when they&#x27;re at \\\\nsea are critical. So all the new ships we&#x27;ve talked about, \\\\nPolar security cutter, Waterway commerce cutter, Offshore \\\\npatrol cutter, all come ashore.\\\\n    They come back and need to be maintained and worked on. And \\\\nso the shore infrastructure investments are critical. As we \\\\ncontinue to field new assets as a Coast Guard, the needle for \\\\nmore space, and Seattle is a perfect example, the ships, the \\\\npolar security cutters will be larger and deeper. And so \\\\nthere&#x27;s a need to invest.\\\\n    But it&#x27;s not just Seattle. It&#x27;s Seattle, it&#x27;s Charleston, \\\\nit&#x27;s Newport. There are needs, around the country, and in \\\\nplaces like Guam as we consider how we posture the force for \\\\nIndo-Pacific operations.\\\\n    The ships and reliable funding to bring the ships online \\\\nare important. But equally as important is the infrastructure \\\\nmoney to ensure that those shore facilities are ready when the \\\\nships are built and ready to return to the port.\\\\n    And so we&#x27;ve stepped into the Seattle work, but more money \\\\nis needed and you see that signaled in $180 in the UPL for \\\\nSeattle.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you. I know significant attention and \\\\ninvestment has been made in the Indo-Pacific region. It is \\\\nsomething you personally have witnessed yourself. Could you \\\\ntell us what assets are most needed to counter adversarial \\\\nactions such as foreign fleets encroaching on the United States \\\\nor even our partners exclusive economic zone, as well as \\\\nillegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing?\\\\n    And then also I am really curious as to what your thoughts \\\\nare on the status of the Scan Eagle Program? And if you could \\\\ntell us a little bit about what the impact has been on the \\\\nCoast Guard operations countering narcotics bound for the \\\\nUnited States with that platform?\\\\n    Admiral Fagan. Yes. In the Indo-Pacific, in that \\\\ncompetitive space as we partner to build capacity and \\\\ncapability and help nations enforce their own sovereignty. I \\\\nspoke to Harriet Lane. With additional funding support, there \\\\ncould be a second Pacific support tender, that type of ship \\\\nthat would create a presence and capacity to partner with \\\\nnations.\\\\n    The FY 2024 budget includes two additional fast response \\\\ncutters that we will look to focus into the region and homeport \\\\nin the region to create that on-water presence and capacity to \\\\npartner with nations, whether it&#x27;s bilaterally or \\\\nmultilaterally.\\\\n    And so the ships, people, training teams all are on the \\\\ntable, with regard to things the Coast Guard can bring to \\\\nensure our national sovereignty and interest in the region. We \\\\nlook forward to budget support for that.\\\\n    Specifically to Scan Eagle. Scan Eagle has been game \\\\nchanging for us, right? Contractor owned, contractor operated, \\\\nship based, ship launched, ship retrieved, unmanned system.\\\\n    I spoke to some of our counter narcotics efforts. It is \\\\ngame changing. It just changes the dynamic, with regard to risk \\\\nand capacity and ability to do those interdictions. When we \\\\nhave ships operating in the western Pacific, they operate the \\\\nUAS as they are, you know, sailing, operating, navigating \\\\nconsistent with international law.\\\\n    Again, just create awareness and a tool and a capability \\\\nthat has really, really been helpful to the Coast Guard.\\\\n    Mr. Newhouse. I think it is important that people \\\\nunderstand the game changer that has been. Thank you very much \\\\nfor being with us today.\\\\n    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Amodei. I would like to, again, thank you, Admiral for \\\\ncoming. Appreciate your testimony.\\\\n    For those questions that members have posed, if we could \\\\ntry to get those squared away in about 15 calendar days, \\\\nbecause, as we are all aware, we are trying to move \\\\nexpeditiously here, in terms of subcommittee work to committee \\\\nand on the floor.\\\\n    Members may submit additional questions for the record and \\\\nwe would ask that you respond to those in a timely manner.

Welcome to the Ways and Means Subcommittee \\\\nField Hearing on Opportunity Zones, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and \\\\nthe Subcommittee will please come to order.\\\\n    Welcome to Erie, Pennsylvania. And I say this to my \\\\ncolleagues who are up here at the desk; I don&#x27;t think they \\\\nexpected to see this type of a turnout. This is incredible. So \\\\nI see Senator Laffa (?). We&#x27;re used to this type of turnout \\\\nanytime we get together, right? Brad. Everybody&#x27;s here with us.\\\\n    So listen, our team is very excited to have you here today \\\\nfor the Field Hearing on the success story of Erie&#x27;s \\\\nOpportunity Zone and how this Committee can create \\\\nopportunities for Erie--in areas such as Erie to thrive in the \\\\nRust Belt and throughout the country.\\\\n    Thank you, Chairman Smith, and your team, for all your hard \\\\nwork that you&#x27;ve done these last few months to bring this \\\\ncommittee to western Pennsylvania. I also want to take a moment \\\\nto thank all those in this community who have helped my team \\\\nand I make this event such a success. Without your efforts, \\\\nnone of this could be done. You&#x27;re all the epitome of what \\\\nmakes Erie thrive, and we are here today because of your \\\\ndedication to protecting and revitalizing this community.\\\\n    For those of you unfamiliar with Erie, Erie residents are \\\\nproud of their rich history. In the 1600s, the Eriez Indians \\\\nfirst settled on the lake shore. The French later controlled \\\\nthe region, building a fort on Presque Isle, which they would \\\\nlater play a pivotal role in the War of 1812. Lake Erie served \\\\nas a hub for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s fleet. The Brigs Niagara and \\\\nLawrence helped secure victory in the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie. \\\\nThe reconstruction Oliver Hazard Perry&#x27;s Flagship, the U.S. \\\\nBrig Niagara sails in the Lake Erie off the Presque Isle Bay, \\\\nis responsible for Erie&#x27;s nickname, The Flagship City.\\\\n    Now, after the war and through the 1900s, Erie grew rapidly \\\\nwith busy rail lines and ports. Manufacturing jobs attracted \\\\nwaves of immigrants to the northwest corner of Pennsylvania. \\\\nThe population of Erie peaked in 1960 with 140,000 residents. \\\\nLike many areas in the Rust Belt, Erie experienced a loss of \\\\ngood-paying manufacturing jobs and suffered perpetual \\\\npopulation decline.\\\\n    Today, Erie&#x27;s population sits at just around 90,000 people. \\\\nThe downtown zip code, 16501, became home to one of the poorest \\\\nzip codes in the United States. But as I mentioned, Western \\\\nPennsylvanians are proud of our history and have deep pride in \\\\nthe area where we live, with many folks born and raised in \\\\nthese towns and choosing to raise the next generation right \\\\nhere in Erie, we have a vested interest in making our \\\\ncommunities thrive like they did in our parents&#x27; and \\\\ngrandparents&#x27; generations.\\\\n    It was recently stated that Erie is a city with a can-do \\\\nattitude, great work ethic and a true sense of community and \\\\nfamily. Because of this, Erie community leaders came together \\\\nto begin the revitalization efforts. With the help from key \\\\nstakeholders and pivotal leaders of the community, the Erie \\\\nRefocused plan took shape and the downtown--Erie Downtown \\\\nDevelopment Corporation began their work through property \\\\ndevelopment in the summer of 2017. Major employers in Downtown \\\\nErie, including Mr. Tom Hagen with Erie Insurance, local \\\\nuniversities and the city&#x27;s top hospitals, partnered together \\\\nto provide the initial funding to launch investment and \\\\ndevelopment.\\\\n    Back in Washington, a bipartisan group of members, led by \\\\nformer representatives Pat Tiberi and Ron Kind, and Senators \\\\nTim Scott and Cory Booker, introduced the original Opportunity \\\\nZone legislation. This legislation, later added to the Tax Cuts \\\\nand Jobs Act, had nearly 100 bipartisan sponsors, which is hard \\\\nto do with the government we&#x27;re in today. Opportunity Zones \\\\nwere designed to provide tax incentives that encourage long-\\\\nterm private capital investment to revitalize low-income areas.\\\\n    The Opportunity Zone program was able to facilitate the \\\\ntype of investments that would best serve the community&#x27;s \\\\nneeds. With the new Opportunity Zone legislation and Tax Cuts \\\\nand Jobs act, investors turn to Erie. After years of work and \\\\nleadership of the Erie Downtown Development Corporation and \\\\nlocal stakeholders, Erie has welcomed 110 new residential \\\\nspaces, created space for 25 new businesses, restored eight \\\\nhistoric properties, revitalized over 100,000 sqft. of \\\\ncommercial space and established a grocery store in what was \\\\npreviously designated a food desert.\\\\n    Erie Downtown Development Corporation stakeholders have \\\\nleveraged $40 million in private capital into a $115 million \\\\ninvestment throughout the downtown area Opportunity Zone, but \\\\nour work on Opportunity Zones is not yet finished.\\\\n    Now, I&#x27;m proud to lead the Opportunity Zones Transparency, \\\\nExtension and Improvement Act with my colleagues, \\\\nRepresentatives Dan Kildee, Carol Miller and Terri Sewell. This \\\\nlegislation strengthens the Opportunity Zones with reporting \\\\nrequirements along with expanding incentives to help those \\\\ncommunities that need it most. Last year, the Ways and Means \\\\nCommittee passed the Small Business Jobs Act, which included \\\\nthese reporting requirements, as well as new Rural Opportunity \\\\nZone program that will revitalize struggling communities in our \\\\nheartlands; a way to ensure cities and towns, regardless of \\\\ntheir population, can benefit from this legislation.\\\\n    I look forward to working with others on these bills and \\\\nother Opportunity Zone legislation as we hand into 2025. \\\\nAdditionally, we have seen on this Main Street in Downtown Erie \\\\nthat success extends to the businesses beyond downtown. \\\\nManufacturing has been a large part of Erie&#x27;s history and \\\\nemploys 25 percent of this community. These jobs, especially \\\\nthose in family-owned businesses, are the backbone of this \\\\ncommunity.\\\\n    This is why the Ways and Means Committee have been \\\\ncommitted to extending and expanding pro-growth tax policy, \\\\nlike immediate expensing for R&amp;D and 100 percent bonus \\\\ndepreciation, so we can give companies the tools they need to \\\\ninvest in their factories, their equipment, and most \\\\nimportantly, their workers. This will allow for Americans to \\\\nremain more competitive in the global economic economy and keep \\\\nfolks on the job right here at home.\\\\n    Finally, I&#x27;m happy to have this panel of witnesses with us \\\\ntoday to testify on the success of Opportunity Zones. The \\\\nimpact in this community, as well as other tax provisions that \\\\nimpact the manufacturing industry in the Erie Community.\\\\n    Before I turn this over, I think that that too often people \\\\nhave talked about Erie in the past tense. And for those of us \\\\nthat are familiar with Erie, know we would never, ever, ever \\\\ngive up on who we are, what we are and who made us what we are. \\\\nOpportunity Zones became something that we never expected to \\\\nhave happen. Yet, Erie embraced it right from the beginning and \\\\nhas turned itself around.\\\\n    This is an incredible tribute to this community, the people \\\\nwho live here, the people who work here, and the people who \\\\ncame here to begin with--to start a family and to have a strong \\\\ncommunity.\\\\n    Now I&#x27;m privileged to have with me several of our Members. \\\\nAnd now it is my honor to recognize the General Lady from \\\\nWisconsin, Ms. Moore, for her opening statement. Ms. Moore.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you so very much, Mr. Kelly. \\\\nThank you for inviting us to this beautiful community; another \\\\ngreat place on the Great Lake. I hail from Milwaukee, \\\\nWisconsin, and Mr. Hawkins, I don&#x27;t think Cleveland is a \\\\nmistake on the Lake. I do think that while we talk about this \\\\nbeing the Rust Belt region, we should just reimagine it as \\\\nwe&#x27;re doing here today, and call it the Fresh Coast. I think \\\\nwe&#x27;re going to see a lot of immigration to this area because \\\\nthese Great Lakes are a great, hidden secret, not only to the \\\\nUnited States, but to this world.\\\\n    I have enjoyed my visit here in Erie. I want to thank Mr. \\\\nWhiting for having lunch with us today. I was listening, \\\\nalthough my ears are not as good, to try to catch some of the \\\\nother just subtle sort of nuances. I know that you have great \\\\ntestimony here today. And of course, Mr. Hawkins, nice to see \\\\nyou again. You&#x27;re the power behind the throne. And just really \\\\nwant to congratulate Senator Scott and my own Senator, retired \\\\nRepresentative Ron Kind, for introducing this and pushing us to \\\\nthis point where we can look at how to renew it and how to \\\\nimprove it. It&#x27;s really obvious that it&#x27;s hard to track the \\\\nimpact of Opportunity Zones, given the lack of reporting \\\\nrequirements and transparency by investors.\\\\n    That holds true in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but I&#x27;m aware of \\\\nsome of the important investments that have occurred in my own \\\\ndistrict. I just hope you can hold on and I can share that with \\\\nyou. For example, the Good City Brewing Company was one of the \\\\nfirst companies in the region to use the federal Opportunity \\\\nZone program, which attracted investors to bring cash into a \\\\ndeal in the facility in the Century City Business Park.\\\\n    The Century City Business Park is a 44,000 square foot \\\\nempty space and a building that was the headquarters of the old \\\\nA.O. Smith factory, which at one time employed 30,000 people \\\\nwho lived in, what is now, the inner city of Milwaukee. And \\\\nthen there was Talgo&#x27;s railcar refurbishing facility, the \\\\nsecond tenant. That was good news.\\\\n    Now, the Central City Business Park was in a real tough \\\\npart of the neighborhood. The entire area is in dire need of \\\\nrehabilitation. So, it wasn&#x27;t a surprise to me that Milwaukee \\\\nhad to use public funds to kind of bail out the businesses, but \\\\nthat was only temporary. We can boast that the Century City \\\\nBuilding, located on the Northwest side is 100 percent leased \\\\nand occupied. Just last month, the Craft Beverage Warehouse \\\\nannounced that it&#x27;s looking to develop a new facility in the \\\\nbusiness firm.\\\\n    That said, I&#x27;m also aware of the opportunity projects \\\\nfunded that I wondered whether they&#x27;re the best use for funds \\\\nfor the community, such as some of the condo projects that \\\\ncatered to higher incomes.\\\\n    So, that&#x27;s just a taste of what we&#x27;re seeing in Milwaukee. \\\\nTo the witnesses here today, thank you for coming. I look \\\\nforward to hearing more of your testimony. Now, Mr. Chairman, \\\\nas we explore the Opportunity Zone it&#x27;s important to be clear \\\\neyed about what we&#x27;re talking about here. The tax benefit \\\\nconferred on taxpayers who invest in qualified opportunity \\\\nfunds are tax benefits for the rich. Now, in fact, the Joint \\\\nCommittee on Taxation found that the average income for \\\\nqualified opportunity fund investors, nearly $1.1 million a \\\\nyear.\\\\n    Now, I know that you can start rolling your eyes, \\\\nespecially the Chairman of the full committee and say, here we \\\\ngo again, these liberal democrats, about going on about tax \\\\ncuts for the rich, but I&#x27;m going to surprise you here today, \\\\nChairman. I get it, that so many parts of the country, Erie \\\\nbeing one of them, Mr. Hawkins, need capital and private \\\\ninvestment.\\\\n    I can understand why we might need a program to encourage \\\\nthat kind of private investment in areas where the return on \\\\ncapital might not otherwise be so great. And even though I know \\\\npeople are looking for capital, and look for people who need \\\\nmoney, you&#x27;re not going to hear me say these are tax cuts for \\\\nthe rich.\\\\n    I don&#x27;t have unlimited time. I&#x27;m just a Ranking Member \\\\nhere, but I just need to make one last point, Mr. Chairman, and \\\\nthat is that I think that we just need to work further to make \\\\nsure that there&#x27;s a connection between enriching the richest \\\\ninvestors and making sure that there&#x27;s a real solid public \\\\npurpose for this funding, because this is being funded by \\\\ntaxpayers.\\\\n    And so I just want to say before I go, I got pages to go, \\\\nbut like Drake would say, and I&#x27;m the Ranking Member here \\\\ntoday, so I take certain privileges and, you know, I sit on \\\\nthat lower--in D.C., but I&#x27;m like Drake, I started from the \\\\nbottom and now I&#x27;m here. And I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you, Ms. Moore. That&#x27;s a pretty good \\\\ntestimony--good opening remarks. I will say this though, if I \\\\nmay. Because I remember when we were doing Opportunity Zones \\\\nand one of the complaints was, you were only concerned about \\\\nthe wealthy people. And my answer to that was, well, they have \\\\nthe money to invest using the core tax dollars to invest where \\\\nnobody else would invest, because it didn&#x27;t look like a \\\\npromising thing.\\\\n    We encouraged people to invest in their communities, to \\\\nmake a change in a community that had been forgotten, that \\\\npushed aside, and nobody was going into. This, by the way, was \\\\nable to bring those folks to say, you know what, I will take a \\\\nchance. I will invest in their, using not taxpayer funded \\\\nrevenues, but using private dollars.\\\\n    So with that, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \\\\nMr. Smith.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Chairman Kelly. Let me first \\\\nbegin by thanking you for hosting us here in your beautiful \\\\ncity, and also to the Warner Theatre for hosting us today. \\\\nBeautiful, beautiful. And I want to thank each and every one of \\\\nyou for coming out. I believe it&#x27;s extremely important to go \\\\noutside of Washington and see real America and see how we can \\\\nmake policy that benefits rural America, but also see policies \\\\nthat does not benefit real America.\\\\n    I&#x27;m also sure I speak for all who participated, how \\\\ngratifying and informative today&#x27;s tour of the Erie Opportunity \\\\nZones was in helping paint a fuller picture of the true value \\\\nof the program. The Ways and Means Committee is in Erie, \\\\nPennsylvania, because it is home to a true American success \\\\nstory that was born out of the hard work of the local community \\\\nand common sense economic policies.\\\\n    Erie was once home to the poorest zip codes in the nation, \\\\nbut that changed in part because of the 2017 Trump tax cuts \\\\nthat not only lowered the tax burden on low-income families and \\\\nraised wages, but also made critical investments in the \\\\nstrength and vitality of local communities through the \\\\nOpportunity Zone program established under the law. Opportunity \\\\nZones have sparked a flood of private investment in communities \\\\nmost in need of an economic boost, and in Erie, over $750 \\\\nmillion has flowed to support the local community.\\\\n    Again, those are private sector dollars, not federal funds. \\\\nThe Ways and Means Committee is working to build on the success \\\\nof the Trump tax cuts, and that includes the Opportunity Zones \\\\nprogram. In June of last year, the Committee approved the Small \\\\nBusiness Jobs Act, legislation to incentivize investment in \\\\nAmerica&#x27;s Main Street businesses to make it easier for them to \\\\ngrow and create jobs, while also expanding the Opportunity Zone \\\\nprogram to incorporate more rural communities.\\\\n    A key piece of that legislation was authored by our Tax \\\\nSubcommittee Chairman Kelly, and includes important reporting \\\\nrequirements to ensure Opportunity Zones are being set up in \\\\naccordance with the law and delivering on the promise of the \\\\npolicy.\\\\n    At the Ways and Means Committee, we have made substantial \\\\nprogress towards supporting Main Street businesses that are \\\\nbuilding stronger communities. There is more to be done, a lot \\\\nmore to be done. We are in Erie to hear your thoughts about the \\\\nimportance of these tax provisions because it&#x27;s clear President \\\\nBiden isn&#x27;t listening. President Biden has pledged to let the \\\\nTrump tax cuts expire.\\\\n    We know what that means for local economies like Erie. \\\\nStarting in 2026, the average family of four in Erie, earning \\\\njust shy of $60,000 will see their taxes go up by over $1,200 \\\\nper year upon expiration of those 2017 tax cuts. We know the \\\\nsmall businesses that are the engine of growth in our \\\\nOpportunity Zones will face a top rate, well over 40 percent. \\\\nThe families who earn the paychecks, raise their families and \\\\nhelp keep the stores open on Main street will see their child \\\\ntax credit and their guaranteed tax deduction slashed in half.\\\\n    We cannot allow for the success that has taken hold in Erie \\\\nin communities all across our country to be rolled back or \\\\nabandoned by letting the tax policies that have done so much \\\\nfor so many expire. Members of this Committee are already \\\\nworking with our tax teams to protect families and small \\\\nbusinesses from losing the Trump tax cuts next year. One of \\\\nthose tax teams, chaired by Representative Kelly, is the \\\\nCommunity Development team, which will focus on how we can \\\\nencourage and incentivize more main street investments, expand \\\\nhousing opportunities and support small communities so they can \\\\ngrow and meet the needs of families where they live and work. I \\\\nwant to thank the witnesses for taking time out of your busy \\\\nschedule for being here today, and I also want to make sure \\\\nthat we have the opportunity to hear from everyone in the \\\\naudience as well. There will be clipboards that you will see \\\\nthat will be passed out for everyone to share with us your \\\\nconcerns and ideas.\\\\n    We will enter into the official hearing record and take \\\\nthose back with us to Washington. So please get a clipboard, \\\\nwrite down your information, and it will be submitted into the \\\\nofficial record. It is a pleasure to be in Erie, Pennsylvania. \\\\nAnd it&#x27;s a pleasure to be with you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you, Chairman. Now I&#x27;m going to \\\\nintroduce our witnesses, Mr. Drew Whiting, who is the CEO of \\\\nthe Erie Downtown Development Corporation. Shay Hawkins is \\\\nPresident and CEO of Opportunity Funds Association. Jason Spore \\\\nis Founder and Owner of Ippa Pizza (Napoletana). Tom Tredway is \\\\nPresident of Erie Molded Packaging. First of all, thank you all \\\\nfor taking time out of your lives here with us today, because \\\\nit&#x27;s important for the community to actually hear the people \\\\nwho are on the ground working in these programs and how it \\\\nworks for you. So thank you for doing that today.\\\\n    Now, your written statements will be made part of the \\\\nhearing record and each of you will have five minutes to \\\\ndeliver your opening oral remarks.\\\\n    Mr. Whiting, you may begin, please.\\\\n\\\\n   STATEMENT OF DREW WHITING, CEO, ERIE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT \\\\n                          CORPORATION\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. Chairman, Ranking Members, it&#x27;s a privilege to \\\\nsit in front of you on behalf of the Erie Community and the \\\\nErie Downtown Development Corporation to thank you for \\\\nproviding a legislative catalyst that has changed the \\\\ntrajectory of our community for the better.\\\\n    The story of Erie over the last half century is familiar to \\\\nanyone acquainted with the Greater Rust Belt region. A once-\\\\nproud manufacturing center of the Great Lakes with a thriving \\\\nmiddle class became a shell of itself over several decades. \\\\nCommunity decline, often measured and communicated in terms \\\\npopulation loss and other traditional economic metrics, is \\\\nactually felt through the despair and the eventual apathy of \\\\nits citizenry. A little less than a decade ago, Erie&#x27;s private \\\\nsector leadership, determined to reverse course, began \\\\ndesigning a place to shock our city back to life.\\\\n    Opportunity Zone legislation passed as part of the Tax Cuts \\\\nand Jobs Act, provided our stakeholders a major tool necessary \\\\nto attract investment required to execute on that plan. Today, \\\\nwe celebrate Erie as one of the best examples of OZ-enabled \\\\ntransformation, the beneficiary of federal economic development \\\\ncatalyst that has served as a model for many other communities \\\\nacross the country.\\\\n    In December of 2021, after living in Chicago for more than \\\\n14 years, my wife and I moved Erie to be closer to family. Hers \\\\nin Erie, mine in Buffalo. We were working remotely, had no real \\\\nplans to be involved in this community, but after landing in \\\\ntown, that notion very quickly changed. It was less than a week \\\\nbefore we met new friends at the EDDC&#x27;s Flagship City Food \\\\nHall, joined Radius, a longstanding pioneering co-working \\\\ncommunity and were introduced to members of our business \\\\ncommunity.\\\\n    From the bay front to the tracks, I noticed scaffolding, \\\\ncranes, announcements of new investments and projects \\\\nthroughout the community. More importantly, I could feel it. I \\\\ncould feel the buzz, the energy that can only be described as a \\\\nfeeling of optimism and hope about the direction of this \\\\ncommunity. That feeling led us to immerse ourselves in the \\\\ncommunity. Before we were here for even a year, we purchased an \\\\nanchor building on State Street with the intent of contributing \\\\nto the factor--to the fabric of our new home in a positive way. \\\\nThat renovation has been done through an Opportunity Zone fund.\\\\n    Now, as the CEO of Erie Downtown Development Corporation \\\\nand as a fully-converted believer in the potential of this \\\\ncity, I&#x27;ve joined the deep ranks of Erie evangelists who tout \\\\nour quality of life, reasonable cost of living, amenity-rich \\\\ndowntown and resources that we possess on our Bayfront and with \\\\nPresque Isle State Park and beyond.\\\\n    While it&#x27;s difficult to measure community pride, I can tell \\\\nyou that despite the hits this community has taken, that pride \\\\nis coming back. Look behind me. A major reason for that is the \\\\nforward progress that you all saw today, and that was enabled \\\\nby your Opportunity Zone legislation. Established in 2016 to \\\\nrevitalize Erie, the Erie Downtown Development Corporation, \\\\nunder the leadership of private and local stakeholders and \\\\nJohn----\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Excuse me, the chart&#x27;s over there because I \\\\nthink it&#x27;s important to see the return on that investment.\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. Oh, Yeah. Spent $27 and-a-half million of \\\\nequity investment in the Erie Downtown Equity Fund, which was \\\\nleveraged to invest in $113 million of development over the \\\\nnext seven years. Phase One, as it&#x27;s termed, nearing completion \\\\nlater this month, has resulted in development progress and \\\\nattraction of external investment in a fraction of the \\\\nanticipated timeframe, primarily because of the catalytic \\\\nimpact of opportunities on legislation.\\\\n    The chart you see over here says volumes. It&#x27;s also \\\\nimportant to note that beyond that, we&#x27;ve attracted over $100 \\\\nmillion of other investment into this town from people that are \\\\nnot from Erie, that have no connection to this place. Ms. \\\\nMoore, we are happy to report the above to you at any time, and \\\\nunder a more stringent reporting regime, we&#x27;re happy to do it \\\\nin even more detail.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. And maybe closer up, too.\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. Maybe closer up.\\\\n    In addition to that, other development money that&#x27;s come to \\\\ntown, we&#x27;ve also seen companies like Truck-Lite, Kyocera come \\\\ninto town. National Fuel make downtown their continued \\\\nheadquarters. They&#x27;ve decided to remain or move operations to \\\\nErie based on the positive progress we&#x27;re making downtown and \\\\nthe way that progress is radiating outside of that.\\\\n    Because of the progress we&#x27;ve made in Erie, I received \\\\nfrequent visitors and calls from thought leaders in the \\\\neconomic development realm. Though each has its own approach, \\\\nmost convey some version of hey, you&#x27;ve done a great job, but \\\\ndo not stop here. You need to do more.\\\\n    As you can see behind me, with a room full of Erieites \\\\n(sic) showing up to let you all know that we appreciate the \\\\nwork that you&#x27;ve done for us, we also want to let you know we \\\\nare committed to doing more. We do not view our work as an \\\\neffort that will last a decade. We expect we will be working \\\\nfor a generation or more to fully reverse several decades of \\\\ndecline. Thus, it&#x27;s crucial that OZ benefits and other tax \\\\npolicy and expansion tools are continued so that we can \\\\nprogress as a region.\\\\n    Our story is not finished. We have plenty of work to do. We \\\\nremain steadfast in our commitment to our mission. We&#x27;ve never \\\\nbeen more motivated than we are today. Community pride in Erie \\\\nis surging. A community now richer with hope and optimism for \\\\nthe future. Thank you for working in a bipartisan fashion to \\\\nenable our work over this past decade and for many years to \\\\ncome.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Whiting follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Okay.\\\\n    Thank you. I appreciate it, Mr. Whiting. Now, we recognize \\\\nMr. Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins, you are now recognized. I will tap \\\\nthe mic when it gets down to where you&#x27;re at 30 seconds left to \\\\ngo. As I know you all have a lot to say.\\\\n    I hate to shut everybody off because it&#x27;s your day and it&#x27;s \\\\nour purpose of being here, to listen to you, but Mr. Hawkins, \\\\nyou are recognized five minutes.\\\\n\\\\n   STATEMENT OF SHAFRON ``SHAY&#x27;&#x27; HAWKINS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, \\\\n                 OPPORTUNITY FUNDS ASSOCIATION\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Well, Chairman Kelly, Ranking Member Moore, \\\\nChairman Smith, thank you for having me today. This is my 7th \\\\ntime testifying before Congress, but my first time testifying \\\\nbefore the Tax Subcommittee. So I really thank you and it&#x27;s a \\\\nspecial privilege for me to be testifying again in the \\\\nheartland as I was born and currently reside just an hour and-\\\\na-half west of here in Cleveland, Ohio. And I appreciate your \\\\ncomment, Representative Moore, that Cleveland is not a mistake \\\\non the Lake. It&#x27;s part of that freshwater kingdom you \\\\ndescribed, and so we are--I really appreciate you allowing me \\\\nto be a part of this.\\\\n    So I am Co-Founder and President of the Opportunity Funds \\\\nAssociation, a trade association whose members are \\\\nentrepreneurs, investors, developers and fund managers \\\\noperating in Opportunity Zones. Opportunity Zones are arguably \\\\nthe most successful community development policy in American \\\\nhistory. So this afternoon, I would like to discuss how \\\\nOpportunity Zones are targeting private investment in areas of \\\\nthe country that have been de industrialized, and how tax \\\\npolicy can be used to build domestic supply chains, incur free \\\\ninvestment, and renew prosperity in places like Erie, but also \\\\nin the often overlooked rural communities across this nation.\\\\n    And so, you know, prior to Cofounding OFA, I served as \\\\nmajority staff director the Senate Finance Subcommittee on \\\\nEnergy, Natural Resources and Infrastructure, and as tax \\\\ncounsel to Senator Tim Scott, where I helped champion the \\\\nInvesting and Opportunity Act, which became opportunity \\\\ncenters. Analysis from the Economic Innovation Group, using \\\\ndata from recent studies at UC Berkeley and our Treasury \\\\nDepartment, found that by 2020, OZ had already achieved \\\\nunprecedented geographic reach and scale.\\\\n    So just two and-a-half years after zone designation, nearly \\\\nhalf--again, half, or roughly 3,800 communities across every \\\\nstate that receive investment, with those investments being \\\\namong the highest-need communities in the U.S. And so how can \\\\nCongress help to reinvigorate and bring prosperity to \\\\nheartland?\\\\n    Well, first of all, we need to urge President Biden to \\\\nabandon plans for any tax increases. Working families are \\\\nalready seeing tightening budgets and higher prices. Over the \\\\npast few years, our consumer prices have risen 19 percent. \\\\nForty percent for electricity, 30 percent for gasoline, 46 \\\\npercent for car insurance, 51 percent and 30 percent--I&#x27;m \\\\nsorry, 30 percent for baby food. And so adding to this, the Tax \\\\nFoundation estimates that we would lose 788,000 full-time jobs \\\\nand 2.2 percent of GDP if the President&#x27;s fiscal year 2025 \\\\nbudget were enacted in his proposed budget.\\\\n    And so, you know, first do no harm. In terms of Opportunity \\\\nZones, as Representative Moore indicated, it is critical, and \\\\nperhaps the most important step that Congress can take to \\\\noptimize sustainable growth and Opportunity Zones, we need to \\\\npass a bill adding reporting and transparency requirements, \\\\nsuch as those found in the Small Business Jobs Act and those \\\\nlargely mirrored in Chairman Smith&#x27;s opportunity Zone \\\\nTransparency Expansion and Improvement Act. And so that is \\\\ncritical.\\\\n    We also need to jumpstart our rural investment by allowing \\\\nfor intermediary investments in what are called feeder funds, \\\\nwhich will enable more investment from smaller, more qualified \\\\nopportunity funds in a fund to funds model that will enable \\\\nsmaller, regionally focused, impact-oriented funds that are \\\\nmore likely to invest in rural areas and also solve the problem \\\\nthat Representative Moore noted, with only large investors \\\\nbeing involved in the process.\\\\n    So we can solve that today. And lastly, we need to enact \\\\nlegislation, as my fellow witness noted, to extend this great \\\\npolicy. With that transparency reporting information will be \\\\nable to better understand how Opportunity Zones are performing, \\\\nand then you and Congress can tweak that to make this great \\\\npolicy even more effective. So I appreciate you having me \\\\ntoday, and I look forward to hearing from my fellow witnesses \\\\nand my discussion with you all.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Hawkins follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you, Mr. Hawkins.\\\\n    Mr. Spore, you&#x27;re now recognized for five minutes.\\\\n\\\\n    STATEMENT OF JASON SPORE, FOUNDER AND OWNER, IPPA PIZZA \\\\n                           NAPOLETANA\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. I&#x27;d like to start today by thanking Subcommittee \\\\nChairman Kelly, Ranking Member Moore, Chairman Smith, and \\\\nMembers of the Ways and needs committee for allowing me the \\\\nopportunity to comment today on the impact the Opportunity Zone \\\\nin Erie, Pennsylvania. The policies that shape it and the \\\\ninvestments made by organizations who invest have had on my \\\\nbusiness.\\\\n    Ippa Pizza Napoletana was established in 2022 as a food \\\\ntruck with the central commissary about a mile and-half down \\\\nthe road. I set off on this venture with the hopes and dreams \\\\nof creating some of the best pizza in the region; the nation \\\\nreally. Like any business first starting out, I had big goals. \\\\nI have a mission, vision, values. Those all serve as my \\\\nguideposts. Ultimately, I wanted to build something that my \\\\nfamily could be proud of and that the Erie community could be \\\\nproud of. I have a goal of supporting the local economy with \\\\npurchase of my raw goods. More important is to build a culture \\\\ninside of my organization where individuals who maybe didn&#x27;t \\\\nget the best start in life would find a place to work that \\\\nwould teach self-worth, leadership and growth both personally \\\\nand professionally.\\\\n    What started out as a dream in college when my mom actually \\\\nlaughed at me when I asked her to teach me how to make dough \\\\nover the phone, turned into an obsession. So where did the name \\\\nIppa come from? It came from my son Colby when he was 18 months \\\\nold and learning how to talk. That&#x27;s what he said. That&#x27;s the \\\\nway that he said pizza. He&#x27;d reach for this guy and say, ippa, \\\\nippa, reaching for another slice. He&#x27;s truly a boy after my own \\\\nheart.\\\\n    So I learned to make authentic Neapolitan pizza from a \\\\nworld champion pizzaiolo, or pizza maker, who runs two of the \\\\nmost acclaimed pizza restaurants in New York City. I took these \\\\nlearnings and I built a product serving naturally-fermented \\\\ndough made in part from locally sourced wheat from Pittsburgh. \\\\nWe source garlic and heirloom tomatoes and cheese curd from \\\\nlocal and regional farmers and producers when in season. We \\\\ncompost our organic scraps with a local company and donate the \\\\nfresh compost back to farmers who then again regrow our \\\\nvegetables. All this is done not because it&#x27;s easy or cheap, \\\\nbut because it results in a better product.\\\\n    We feel an immense sense of pride being one of the largest \\\\ncustomers of each of these other small businesses and \\\\ncontributing to local supply chains. If we can be a part of \\\\nanother business&#x27;s success story, it&#x27;s a good thing, and JFK \\\\nonce said, a rising tide lifts all boats.\\\\n    Like any small business, we faced challenges early. \\\\nSpecifically, we needed more employees and marketing. As almost \\\\na 50-year old trying to learn the intricacies of today&#x27;s social \\\\nmedia, you&#x27;ll find out real quick why marketing is a four-year \\\\ndegree. I was also working and continued to work full time, so \\\\ntime management and allocation of resources had to be more \\\\nefficient. We learned limitations that existed in our current \\\\noperation. We knew that if were to become viable, we needed to \\\\ntransition into a brick and mortar operation as soon as \\\\npossible. In short, we needed help.\\\\n    Upon all these realizations, I simultaneously learned of a \\\\npotential opening in the Flagship City Food Hall, right in the \\\\nmiddle Erie, PA&#x27;s Opportunity Zone. I began to understand what \\\\nan Opportunity Zone was and how the investments made were truly \\\\na win, win, win for the businesses that invest in these \\\\ndepressed areas. The new business owners who touch the \\\\ncustomers directly, like myself, and most important, the \\\\ngreater community that ultimately becomes a vibrant place to \\\\nlive, work and play.\\\\n    The companies who invest, like Erie Insurance, UPMC, \\\\nGannon, Mercyhurst, Plastek, the Erie Community Foundation, AHN \\\\nand Highmark, the Hagen family and all the local banks; they \\\\nget deferred tax benefits. They get breaks on capital gains, \\\\ntax breaks on capital gains, but it&#x27;s not about that. What do \\\\nthey give? They give the citizens of Erie a new beginning, \\\\noptions to work, play and shop. They give the opportunity to \\\\nmake the community in which they choose to operate, great. They \\\\nprovide revitalization and make people want to work and live \\\\nhere, raise their families, visit on a vacation. And they give \\\\nthe opportunity for people like me to live the American dream.\\\\n    Ippa Pizza Napoletana relocated to 22 North Park Row in \\\\nJanuary of 2024. Remember when I said we needed help? The \\\\nprofessionalism and guidance by Drew Whiting, the President of \\\\nthe EDDC. Corey Cook in the back there, he&#x27;s the Director of \\\\nOperations. Mark Inscho, Director of Food and Beverage. Paula \\\\nGregory, the Controller, were invaluable and just what we \\\\nneeded through this transition. What about marketing? The help \\\\nafforded by Ryan Hoover, the experienced director, was one of \\\\nthe biggest surprises. When Ryan&#x27;s in the building, our \\\\nbusiness gets highlighted to the Greater Erie community, and we \\\\nmake money, which is the lifeblood of everything we&#x27;re talking \\\\nabout today.\\\\n    What about access to motivated employees and other business \\\\nowners? Because of the groundwork laid several years ago, a \\\\ntransplant to Erie like me was able to grow fast and I&#x27;m proud \\\\nto say that we now employ 12 employees, where we ran for a year \\\\nand-a-half with only three, and we&#x27;re still hiring. At Ippa, \\\\nour story is just getting started.\\\\n    So what happens if the tax provisions afforded investors in \\\\nOpportunity Zones expire with no legislative action? I hope \\\\nI&#x27;ve shown you what happens when this legislation is \\\\nunderstood, appreciated and acted upon. Everyone in this room \\\\nunderstands where we were in this community. 16501, one of the \\\\npoorest zip codes in the United States.\\\\n    A mentor of mine, Uncle B. once said, don&#x27;t just come to me \\\\nwith a problem, bring a solution. One of the poorest zip codes. \\\\nThat&#x27;s our past. Walk across the street and see the progress. \\\\nYou&#x27;ve heard the goals and the dreams and you see the action. \\\\nAnd I&#x27;m not the only one. We&#x27;re living the solution. With your \\\\nhelp, we are fixing it. It&#x27;s a win, win, win. Let&#x27;s not go \\\\nbackwards. Take action. We will make Erie great.\\\\n    Thank you for your time.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Spore follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you, Mr. Spore.\\\\n    Mr. Tredway, you are now recognized.\\\\n\\\\n   STATEMENT OF TOM TREDWAY, PRESIDENT, ERIE MOLDED PACKAGING\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. Good afternoon, Chairman Smith, Chairman \\\\nKelly, Ranking Member Moore, and members of the Committee. My \\\\nname is Tom Tredway. I&#x27;m President of Erie Molded Packaging, \\\\nprivately held family-owned manufacturer, founded right here in \\\\nErie, Pennsylvania. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss \\\\ncritical tax provisions with you today and welcome you to the \\\\nKeystone State.\\\\n    For more than 40 years, Erie Molded has been creating \\\\ncustom injection molding parts and integrated packaging \\\\nsolutions customers all over the country. My father, who was \\\\nalso an Erie native, had the desire to contribute to \\\\nPennsylvania&#x27;s manufacturing sector. After running a successful \\\\nstring of businesses on the west coast in the seventies. He \\\\nfounded the company here in 1982 and has been a pillar of our \\\\ncommunity ever since.\\\\n    For those visiting our state who might not be familiar with \\\\nPennsylvania&#x27;s iconic architecture, our state nickname is \\\\nessential to who we are as people; a keystone is in the center \\\\nof an arch that holds the other stones in place. It is the \\\\nstrongest and most critical part of the structure and once you \\\\nknow what--excuse me. And once you know what they are, you will \\\\nsurely recognize the symbol across the state. The stone \\\\nreflects Pennsylvania&#x27;s historic and political importance in \\\\nAmerica&#x27;s early years. The U.S. tax code also functions as a \\\\nkeystone for our great nation.\\\\n    Manufacturers across the country face unique challenges \\\\nevery day. When our keystone is strong, such as having pro-\\\\ngrowth tax code, we&#x27;re able to build something great. However, \\\\nbeginning in 2022, our tax code began to develop cracks, \\\\nweakening the entire structure. Tax provisions that had either \\\\nbeen in the Code for decades or enacted as part of the 2017 tax \\\\nreform, began expiring in 2022. And there are more damaging \\\\nchanges on the way next year. A weakened tax code, severe \\\\nworker shortages, supply chain disruption, and competition from \\\\nabroad have significantly impacted Pennsylvania&#x27;s manufacturing \\\\ncommunity.\\\\n    I want to thank all the members on the subcommittee who \\\\nsupported the tax relief for American Families and Workers Act \\\\nearlier this year, and I&#x27;m calling my Congress to finish the \\\\njob by getting this bill signed into law. This legislation will \\\\nallow provisions from the 2017 Tax Reform, such as domestic R&amp;D \\\\nexpensing, interest deductibility standards, and full expensing \\\\nprovisions to be extended until 2025.\\\\n    However, Congress has a major tax battle ahead of next year \\\\nwhen crucial tax policies are set to expire, directly impacting \\\\nmanufacturers here in Pennsylvania and across America. In the \\\\nyears following TCJA, Erie Molded was able to invest nearly $7 \\\\nmillion in new capital equipment purchasing thanks to full \\\\nexpensing. Along with this much needed equipment, we also were \\\\nable to create new positions across our team and deliver high-\\\\nquality products to our customers.\\\\n    Full expensing was already phasing out and is set to \\\\ncompletely expire in 2027. This is devastating for our \\\\nmanufacturers and has caused us to delay our own equipment \\\\npurchases. Another harmful change that went into effect is the \\\\nrequirement to amortize our R&amp;D expenses rather than being able \\\\nto deduct them in the year occurred. This is a massive change \\\\nfor us, as historically, 90 percent of our R&amp;D expenses went to \\\\nour engineering payroll. That means eliminating R&amp;D doesn&#x27;t \\\\njust have innovation, it also has a direct impact on people&#x27;s \\\\njobs here and here.\\\\n    Congress not allowing manufacturers to immediately expense \\\\nR&amp;D directly translate to fewer quality jobs in the \\\\nmanufacturing sector, while our foreign competitors are \\\\nimplementing vastly beneficial R&amp;D benefits. This change also \\\\ncaught me and many other manufacturers in our community \\\\ncompletely off guard.\\\\n    In 2023, a full year after the R&amp;D change, I was presented \\\\nwith taxable income that was almost six figures higher than I \\\\nhad anticipated. Changes like this mean I have to spend more \\\\ntime with my accountants and lawyers, figure out the best way \\\\nto prepare for our future instead of going to business.\\\\n    Finally, EMP is organized as a pass- through, meaning when \\\\n20 percent pass-through deduction expires at the end of 2025 \\\\nand individual tax rates increase, our tax bill will be \\\\nsignificantly higher. Many small manufacturers are organized as \\\\npass-throughs, so our sector will be disproportionately harmed \\\\nby the expiration of this deduction, severely hampering our \\\\ngrowth trajectory. Similarly, since many family-owned \\\\nmanufacturers consist largely of illiquid assets, we are \\\\ndisproportionately impacted by the estate tax changes also \\\\ncoming in 2025.\\\\n    I urge every member of this Committee to preserve those and \\\\nother pro-growth provisions which allow manufacturers to \\\\nfunction as the backbone of our economy and compete on a global \\\\nscale. I once again want to thank members of this Subcommittee \\\\nfor inviting me here today. I hope your time in the great state \\\\nleaves you with a lasting impression as you return to work in \\\\nD.C., and you keep the Keystone in mind as you debate our tax \\\\ncode&#x27;s future.\\\\n    [The statement of Mr. Tredway follows:]\\\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Mr. Tredway, thank you. Thank you all for \\\\nyour testimony.\\\\n    My first question is going to be from Mr. Whiting. And I \\\\nthink we brought the chart up. Ms. Moore, this is for you. \\\\nHere. Now, the reason we brought this forward, if you can see \\\\nwhat happened, the taxes paid when these properties were \\\\nacquired, taxes paid $176,185. After Erie downtown Development \\\\nCorporation investment, it was $2,278,400. So the end game to \\\\nall of this is, you know what, I&#x27;ve been through this in my \\\\nlife. There&#x27;s many--a couple times in my life I paid absolutely \\\\nno taxes and people said, how did you get away with that? I \\\\nsaid, we lost money that year. Taxes are based on profits. And \\\\nI think sometimes we forget who it is. The old story, don&#x27;t \\\\nworry about the mule, just load the wagon. When you treat the \\\\nmule the right way, the mule can pull the wagon a lot easier \\\\nand a lot harder.\\\\n    So Mr. Whiting, if you would explain a little bit, you&#x27;re \\\\nworking in an Erie Downtown Development Corporation&#x27;s Mission--\\\\nand I really miss Johnny Persinger for not being here today \\\\nbecause I know it would--how important he was to that and how \\\\nit&#x27;s felt in Downtown Erie. Are there examples of the progress \\\\nof every vitalization of downtown Erie felt in other parts of \\\\nthis community?\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. Yeah, I think--you know, we all Miss John \\\\nPersinger here and I know he&#x27;s--he&#x27;s going to be watching this, \\\\nwishing he was sitting here as well. When I said that our work \\\\nisn&#x27;t done, I meant our work is not done. The new buildings \\\\nthat you saw on State Street today, the first one opened two \\\\nand-a-half years ago. That effort in the two and-a-half years \\\\nsince has led to--in the one-mile radius around it, over $100 \\\\nmillion more investment. If you look at the five and ten-mile \\\\nradiuses from that, you&#x27;re starting to see that work as well, \\\\nwith the announcement of Kyocera and Truck-Lite coming to town. \\\\nA lot of the work in our neighborhoods starting to happen \\\\nthrough the development of different CDC and other vehicles to \\\\nget the neighborhoods ready for this kind of change.\\\\n    We are starting to see it radiate out, but it&#x27;s not there \\\\nyet. This is not a decade long situation effort. This is a \\\\nmultiple generation effort that we&#x27;re going to have to \\\\nundertake to truly do the work completely here. Ten years of an \\\\nOpportunity Zone Act being in place is a great start, but we&#x27;re \\\\nbarely at the quarter pole. Give us another 20 years and you&#x27;ll \\\\nsee a county that has felt the impact of this in a much more \\\\nthorough way than what we&#x27;re seeing right now.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you. Mr. Hawkins, You played a \\\\npivotal role in the Opportunity Zone legislation in your time \\\\nbeing a member of the staff. Part of the Opportunity Zone \\\\nlegislation that was left out in the final package was \\\\ntransparency and reporting requirements. Opportunity Zones have \\\\nalready become one of the most successful provisions of the \\\\nrepublican tax cuts. Can you speak to the importance of \\\\nincluding these requirements and how it further boosts \\\\nOpportunity Zone investment?\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Thank you, Chairman Kelly. Transparency \\\\nreporting requirements are absolutely critical. So what we know \\\\nfrom a UC Berkeley study, a Treasury Department study and some \\\\nprivate information brought together by accounting firm called \\\\nNovogradac, that a hundred billion dollars at least in equity, \\\\nhas gone into opportunity zones thus far. From the Treasury \\\\nstudy, we have a feel for what percentage of each state&#x27;s \\\\nopportunity zones got investments in.\\\\n    So for instance, Pennsylvania, being about 44 percent of \\\\nthe designated zones, saw some investment. And so we have some \\\\nvery broad understanding that the policy is being impactful in \\\\na positive way. But it&#x27;s like looking through a window, a car \\\\nwindow with mud on it and the transparency and reporting \\\\nlegislation would essentially be like a windshield wiper just \\\\npulling the mud off. And so, you know, the legislation that we \\\\nappreciate, so deeply appreciate you introducing, would empower \\\\nTreasury to compare the performance of Opportunity Zones \\\\nagainst areas that could have been designated zones, but \\\\nweren&#x27;t, and also compare the performance, economic performance \\\\nacross a number of key metrics with the broader economy. And \\\\nthat will allow you all on this panel to tweak the policy, but \\\\nwith a clean window, if you will, you know, with a full \\\\nunderstanding of what needs to happen to make the policy even \\\\nmore impactful.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you. Could you speak maybe a little \\\\nbit too on how the opportunity zone have an impact on rural \\\\ncommunities?\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Yes. So that&#x27;s absolutely critical. You know, \\\\none of the things that we see, you know, right now, we have an \\\\nentire Opportunity Zone map that gives us a feel, again, for \\\\nhow diffuse the investment has been. So certain states like \\\\nMississippi, 65 percent of their Opportunity Zones have seen \\\\ninvestment. Places like Utah see significant investment. \\\\nMontana, once again above 60 percent. We see other states where \\\\nyou&#x27;re looking at below 40 percent.\\\\n    And so one key element to drive that would immediately \\\\ndrive capital into rural Opportunity Zones would be this Feeder \\\\nfunds or Fund of Funds addition to the policy. What it \\\\nbasically enables is it enables folks who don&#x27;t know \\\\nspecifically where they want to invest or how to just put--to \\\\ngive that money to smaller impact-oriented funds that know \\\\nexactly what they want to do. And in rural areas, you&#x27;re more \\\\nlikely to see investment in operating businesses. In the dense \\\\nurban areas, you&#x27;re obviously more likely to see investment in \\\\nreal estate.\\\\n    And so favoring operating businesses through feeder funds, \\\\nfavoring smaller, impact oriented investors through feeder \\\\nfunds and a fund of funds concept would absolutely jumpstart \\\\nrural investment.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you. Jason, I wanted to ask you a \\\\nlittle bit. So without the Opportunity Zones, what would the \\\\nfuture of Ippa Pizza be like? And I&#x27;ve got to tell you, first \\\\nof all, I think sometimes people misunderstand. You work full \\\\ntime as it is.\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. I do.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Yeah. So this wasn&#x27;t something that you \\\\nwere looking at and say, hey, here&#x27;s a chance for me to \\\\nreally--to get ahead. But you were still working at the same \\\\ntime and then developing. I&#x27;m interested in where you got the \\\\nrecipes. That&#x27;s really good--that&#x27;s good to be able to get \\\\nthat. In my hometown, none of the Italians would ever share any \\\\nof their recipes with anybody else. That&#x27;s just the way they \\\\nare. The Irish, they give you anything they can give you. But \\\\nif you can, if it hadn&#x27;t been for opportunity zones----\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. You know, I couldn&#x27;t tell you.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY [continuing]. Would you have been able to do \\\\nthis?\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. I&#x27;m a pretty resilient guy, okay? I fight hard, \\\\nand I--sometimes I don&#x27;t know when to give up. So I would hate \\\\nto say no, but what I will tell you, that the speed of which, \\\\nof what I&#x27;ve been able to do and how fast I&#x27;ve grown, okay. The \\\\nOpportunity Zone, the EDDC, the help that they&#x27;ve given and \\\\ncreated for me has been paramount. No way I could do it the way \\\\nthat I&#x27;m doing it now.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Well, I&#x27;ve got to tell you, so----\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. Not even close.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. So what you&#x27;re talking about never giving \\\\nup,----\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY [continuing]. That&#x27;s not only true of you.\\\\n    That&#x27;s true of this town and of this state and of this \\\\ncountry. We never, ever give up. We refuse to lose. That&#x27;s the \\\\nkey to it.\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. It&#x27;s a great quality.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you so much. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. Tredway, can you speak a little bit on the impact that \\\\nR&amp;D has had on your manufacturing business in the community \\\\nthat you work with closely? And if R&amp;D was not extended into \\\\n2025, how would that impact business in the Erie area?\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. So we make proprietary products Erie Molded. \\\\nStock packaging. Not the most exciting thing in the world, but \\\\nit does require a lot of R&amp;D, and most of that R&amp;D is actually \\\\ntied up, as I said earlier, in wages. It&#x27;s a lot of \\\\nengineering, spending time trying to figure out how to make a \\\\nproduct better, bring a new product to market.\\\\n    So, I mean, when that policy changed, and it&#x27;d been that \\\\nway since, what, the mid-50s? It was one of the more \\\\nfrustrating tax policy changes I could remember since being a \\\\nbusinessowner, because now I&#x27;m forced to take something I have \\\\nto pay for right away out of pocket with cash, but expense it \\\\nover five years. And so again, myself and a lot of my other my \\\\ncohorts got a huge tax bill they weren&#x27;t expecting.\\\\n    So I mean, I think it&#x27;s one of the more--it&#x27;s just a \\\\ncritical piece of legislation, especially compare--or tax code \\\\nrather, when you compare how other countries, like, China, a \\\\nlot of European companies treat R&amp;D. We need to do everything \\\\nwe can to incentivize it because otherwise it&#x27;s going to be \\\\nmore challenging for someone like me to make those investments.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you. I think one of the things were \\\\ngoing through Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in the very beginning, we \\\\nwere looking at what we were doing to business around America \\\\nand we were actually driving people out of our country because \\\\nof our policies. The idea that we&#x27;ve turned that around and \\\\npeople are now saying, no, I&#x27;m going to stay in America, I&#x27;m \\\\ngoing to continue to invest in America and I&#x27;m going to look to \\\\nthe future to make it a stronger America, and certainly in the \\\\nworld we live in today, if we don&#x27;t understand the importance \\\\nof that, we understand absolutely nothing.\\\\n    I want to thank you all for being here. It&#x27;s really good to \\\\nhear from you and we&#x27;ll stay in touch. Right now I&#x27;m going to \\\\nrecognize my colleague from Wisconsin, Ms. Moore.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Well, thank you so much, Mr. \\\\nChairman. As you all noticed, the clock has started moving now \\\\nthat I&#x27;m talking, so we&#x27;re going to get through this pretty \\\\nquickly. I just wanted to talk to you, Mr. Spore. You said that \\\\nyou learned at age 50 that marketing was extremely important. \\\\nWhy don&#x27;t you bring us any samples of that pizza so that we \\\\ncould assess and evaluate the value of this investment and----\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. I will personally escort you after the hearing.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. I mean, you--you&#x27;ve just got to \\\\nthink. You really do.\\\\n    I just want to make a comment on some of the things that \\\\nour Chairmen have said because I&#x27;m the only Democrat up here, \\\\nin case you guys didn&#x27;t guess. And one of the things that the \\\\nChairman of our Subcommittee often says, and I even heard Mr. \\\\nHawkins talk about how corporations don&#x27;t pay any taxes, people \\\\npay taxes and it&#x27;s passed on to consumers and so forth. And \\\\nthat the money that we call taxpayers money that we return in \\\\nthe way of tax cuts is not the government&#x27;s money, it&#x27;s their \\\\nmoney.\\\\n    Well, listen, I just wanted to point out that when we, for \\\\nexample, cut corporate taxes to 21 percent from 35 percent, \\\\nunder that tax law, that was taxes that were owed to the public \\\\ntrough to pay for stuff like foreign aid to our ally Israel, \\\\nfor Defense, for veterans housing which is woefully inadequate, \\\\nnursing homes for our seniors, roads and bridges.\\\\n    So yeah, it is money that is owed to all of us, and so when \\\\nwe have policies like the thing that we&#x27;re discussing today, \\\\nfor example, we are deferring taxes that would have otherwise \\\\nbeen paid for the public good and providing them as tax breaks. \\\\nSo, I do want people to know that, respect and appreciate that, \\\\nit is a tax transfer.\\\\n    Now, when the Republicans here talk about how Democrats and \\\\nJoe Biden are going to raise taxes on all these folks out here \\\\nwho are facing inflation and so forth in groceries, gasoline, \\\\nand so forth, I do want you to know that the Tax Cuts and Jobs \\\\nact was designed to provide those business cuts and make them \\\\npermanent, like lowering the taxes from 35 percent to 21 \\\\npercent. They pay for them within the budget window. I can&#x27;t do \\\\na whole class because the clock is moving, but they paid for \\\\nthem by making tax cuts to individuals temporary. So whatever \\\\ntax cuts were made for low income or middle class people were \\\\ntemporary while business taxes were permanent.\\\\n    And Mr. Tredway, in terms of bonus appreciations, we all \\\\nagree with that, pass-throughs, I want you to know that all \\\\nsmall businesses are pass-throughs and they deserve the \\\\nbenefit, but all pass-throughs are not small businesses. So we \\\\nneed to look at that legislation. We&#x27;re not talking about that \\\\ntoday, because 80 percent of that money that benefits these \\\\nsmall manufacturers like you goes to the big-old corporations.\\\\n    Now, that being said, I just want to thank everybody for \\\\nbeing here and want to point out that I think that we have had \\\\nvery good testimony here of how we need to tighten this up \\\\nbecause what we have seen, and that&#x27;s not been the case here in \\\\nErie and not in Milwaukee, but I hear places that we all love \\\\nlike New York City or other places where we&#x27;re scratching our \\\\nheads, Mr. Chairman, and wondering was that the best investment \\\\nof our tax monies that would ordinarily go into the trough to \\\\npay for toward our deficit or whatever and also up rural areas.\\\\n    Mr. Scott comes from South Carolina and so does Mr. \\\\nClyburn. They came up with the 10/20/30 formula and they both \\\\nhad their minds trained on making sure that those areas that \\\\nwere populated with poor people could benefit from it too. I \\\\ndon&#x27;t have any problem with most of this money going to real \\\\nestate, but maybe we ought to put some conditions around it \\\\nwhere we at least have some mixed-use of it.\\\\n    If you&#x27;re gonna&#x27; build gorgeous luxury apartments, maybe a \\\\nthird of them ought to be affordable housing and get that mix \\\\nin, since it is taxpayer money that is providing this \\\\nextraordinary capital gains treatment. As you notice, you see \\\\nthat clock there? That clock will not come on when he \\\\nrecognizes Mr. Smith here. So I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Well, that&#x27;s the good thing about being in \\\\nthe Majority.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. That&#x27;s it.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. I know that it can be offensive at times, \\\\nbut I also would like to point out that while you may not agree \\\\nthat the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a great--great piece of \\\\nlegislation, the great--the most----\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. I didn&#x27;t say that.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Excuse me, excuse me, reclaiming my time.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Oh, I&#x27;m sorry.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. The most revenue we&#x27;ve ever been able to \\\\ncollect was during the TCJA. So as bad as it may be in some \\\\nplaces--but I will tell you what, Ms. Moore, I would be glad to \\\\nwork with you and I would appreciate it--it would&#x27;ve been nice \\\\nif some--some other folks from the democrat part of the--of the \\\\nCommittee would have been here today as just opposed to \\\\nyourself. They were all invited. I guess they didn&#x27;t find time \\\\nand didn&#x27;t see that going to Erie was going to be that big of a \\\\ndeal.\\\\n    But I got to tell you, when we stop talking about democrat \\\\nversus republican, talk about Americans helping fellow \\\\nAmericans, I think we&#x27;re much more successful in that. I try to \\\\nstay away from that and I think that most of us, I think the--\\\\nthe country in general is so polarized. We need to get away \\\\nfrom that. That is what is absolutely destroying this great, \\\\ngreat country.\\\\n    So Mr. Chairman, you&#x27;re recognized.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you. With the magic minute I guess, \\\\nthat&#x27;s--it&#x27;s great to, it&#x27;s great to be here to ask some \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    Mr. Whiting, you&#x27;ve had a front row seat to the way that \\\\nthe Opportunity Zone program has transformed this community in \\\\nErie. We can see the infrastructure. When we were driving \\\\nthrough the streets, you could see that there weren&#x27;t vacant \\\\nbuildings, they were full. I wish that was the case in my home \\\\nState of Missouri. It&#x27;s not. But what has this program meant \\\\nfor the working families of this community? And what about just \\\\nwhat has this meant to this community?\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. So I touched on it in my remarks, but I think \\\\nit has allowed us to take the first steps of forward progress \\\\nthis community has seen in five decades. And that forward \\\\nprogressive inspires others to follow along. It creates a sense \\\\nof optimism, creates a regained sense of community pride. And \\\\none of the things that we&#x27;re really focused on right now too, \\\\nwhen we talk about working families and small businesses, is \\\\nwe&#x27;re not operating a suburban mall food court downtown. Every \\\\nbusiness that comes into our footprint is locally owned and we \\\\nare giving them priorities as they build out their businesses \\\\nso that their families can live the proverbial American dream \\\\nby growing something that&#x27;s theirs and contributing to that \\\\neconomic multiplier effect that we&#x27;re all striving for.\\\\n    The work that we need to do to ensure that those businesses \\\\nhave the tools that they need to be successful is the work \\\\nthat&#x27;s going to make us all sustainable. That means we need to \\\\ncontinue to have expanding tools in order to be able to do \\\\nthat. Whether that&#x27;s tools for businesses that are under a \\\\ncertain size, being exempt from certain taxes, investors in \\\\nthose businesses, getting something back for their dollars in \\\\nyear one, many states are doing it. There&#x27;s no reason I can&#x27;t \\\\nget down to the federal level, too. You guys have the tools. \\\\nWe&#x27;re here to encourage you to use them.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Mr. Hawkins, while Opportunity \\\\nZones have been an incredible success story for many \\\\ncommunities, we now know that 95 percent of the Opportunity \\\\nZone investment has gone to urban areas. In the Small Business \\\\nJobs Act that passed out of the Ways and Means Committee last \\\\nJune, and we included provisions to establish a new rural \\\\nOpportunity Zone program more targeted to rural America.\\\\n    Given your extensive experience with Senator Scott and \\\\nworking on this program, what more should we do to ensure its \\\\nsuccess for rural communities? You kind of touched on that \\\\nearlier, but what--I want to make sure that we see these \\\\nsuccesses all over the country.\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Well, the first critical step is built into \\\\nthat very Small Business Jobs Act, is that transparency in \\\\nreporting. And so were glad to see that the transparency \\\\nreporting requirements in the bill you just noted, mirrored \\\\nthose transparency reporting requirements in the Opportunity \\\\nZone. Transparency Reporting and Extension Act that Chairman \\\\nKelly led. That is critical because then again, be able to make \\\\nreasonable adjustments to the policy, but with a full \\\\nunderstanding, deep understanding of why areas are getting the \\\\ninvestments they&#x27;re getting and what should be done, what \\\\nspecific steps should be taken.\\\\n    So for instance, when you look at the data on affordable \\\\nhousing across the country, there&#x27;s a clear trend that we see \\\\nacross the country; higher--you know, higher housing stock, but \\\\nwithout an intended increase in rents. Right. But the \\\\ntransparency reporting requirements that you have in your Bill \\\\nwould allow us to drill down on that and see why.\\\\n    Some governors prioritized affordable housing. They \\\\nprioritized some areas over others. They had certain--and \\\\ncertain outlook. You know, when you look at, say, a state like \\\\nColorado, where 7 percent of the zone saw investment, that was \\\\nbecause of an intentionality on the part of local government \\\\nthat produced certain results that they wanted to produce. So \\\\nthe first key step is that transparency legislation. The next \\\\nstep is the step you&#x27;ve already both taken.\\\\n    The next step is that feeder funds concept that basically \\\\nbrings operating businesses to the front of the line. Operating \\\\nbusinesses are what it would be to get that number from 5 \\\\npercent, you know, to 20 percent to 10 percent, which \\\\ndirectionally, is what we want to do in these rural areas.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. So the Opportunity Zone program has not \\\\noperated in a vacuum. It was created as part of the Trump tax \\\\ncuts, which provided critical tax relief to working families, \\\\nas well as businesses that employ them, including research and \\\\ndevelopment expensing that was mentioned, which supports 21 \\\\nmillion jobs, a hundred percent immediate expensing on \\\\nequipment, interest deductibility, death tax relief, and the 20 \\\\npercent small business deduction of the 199-A.\\\\n    Mr. Tredway, can you share how these pro-growth tax \\\\npolicies worked in tandem with the Opportunity Zone program to \\\\nbenefit your family-owned small business and others like it?\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. The pro-growth tax strategies from the TCGA \\\\n(sic) put us in a better position to thrive. We had good things \\\\ngoing our way, but having incentives to do research and \\\\ndevelopment, having incentives to make capital investments that \\\\nwe need as a small business to both domestically and \\\\ninternationally, all allowed us to put more money back into our \\\\nemployees, back to our company. Every employee at Erie Molded \\\\nwould tell you that the owners put everything back in.\\\\n    We&#x27;re sending entry-level employees through education, \\\\nthrough different classes, local colleges, and local other--\\\\neducational institutions, so they can get training that will \\\\ncarry with them all the way for the rest of their lives, right? \\\\nAnd we&#x27;re able to do that in a way we never had before.\\\\n    So it allowed us to hire more people, bring more people to \\\\nthis region, and then if you take a look at the Opportunity \\\\nZones, it made it a better place for those people to live, work \\\\nand play. I&#x27;ve been back in area for almost 20 years. I&#x27;ve \\\\nnever seen so much excitement, so much investment downtown. And \\\\nthat&#x27;s a big benefit, because part of our business strategy is \\\\nto retain and attract workers. So Opportunity Zones has had a \\\\nhuge impact in that regard.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you, Chairman. We&#x27;ll now recognize \\\\nthe gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Schweikert for five minutes.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Chairman \\\\nand Ranking Member Moore. We all get titles. I want to walk \\\\nthrough a couple of things, and also, Mr. Kelly, I really \\\\nappreciate it. I&#x27;ve never been in this part of the country. I&#x27;m \\\\nfrom Arizona, and my world is very different than yours. My \\\\ncounty has about 400 or 500 new residents every day. So when \\\\nyou read and look at some of this data here, it&#x27;s, for me to \\\\nget my head around what struggle really is like, but Mr. \\\\nHawkins, I want to walk through, and I don&#x27;t mean to sound like \\\\na heretic, because I personally come from the real estate \\\\nworld, but if I was to sit down with you and say, okay, the \\\\nnext generation of Opportunity Zones, you want more of the \\\\nbenefits to incentivize the actual employment engine than maybe \\\\nthe--the real estate side? You know, we need many of these \\\\nareas to have rehab, this and that, but one of my great \\\\nconcerns is, how do I get the next generation of \\\\nentrepreneurship training, learning to show up at work, things \\\\nlike that, control of work, things like that, to actually also \\\\nhave investment. And sometimes investors who would be \\\\ninterested in that growing concern actually succeed? How would \\\\nyou design--in a short time, how would you design that type of \\\\nfeeder fund?\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Sure. So you&#x27;ll be familiar from the private \\\\nequity world in real estate, private equity, the concept of a \\\\nFund to Funds. So where smaller fund managers, smaller \\\\ninvestors are able to benefit from folks who are just coming in \\\\nand----\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. But--and somebody said it&#x27;s two--two \\\\nthings. Over here I have my credit investment, you can--you \\\\ncould actually take some of our updated and credit investor \\\\nrules and make it so smaller individuals could participate in \\\\nreceiving the tax benefits. And maybe even you could design \\\\nthere where you small equity interests, so you actually have a \\\\nbenefit if the concern does well. I&#x27;m just--I don&#x27;t want to \\\\nhave a world where we&#x27;ve done amazing rehab in difficult areas \\\\nor rural America, where you built--you fixed the building; I \\\\nnow need businesses in that.\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Right.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I need the next--you know, the folks who \\\\nventure to bring in the next generation of talent.\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Right. And the next really exciting--you know, \\\\nexciting possibility is if Congress were to allow after tax \\\\ndollars to come into Opportunity Zones or the benefit of the \\\\nten year--if you hold a--if you hold an investment for ten \\\\nyears, ten plus years, ten years and a day, then you get a 100 \\\\npercent step-up basis. So think of it as no capital gains on \\\\nthe new business that you started in an Opportunity Zone. So \\\\nthat&#x27;ll be--that&#x27;ll mirror what we see in traditional \\\\nbusiness----\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. But----\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS [continuing]. Operating business investment, \\\\nwhich will create more jobs.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Putting your model in your head, is it to \\\\nthe business or is it to the investors in the business?\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. I&#x27;m sorry?\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Is it to the business or the investors in \\\\nthe business?\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. So the gain improves--so if I start Hawkins, \\\\nLLC, you know, and let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a social media company, and \\\\nso I invest a million dollars in capital gains into that \\\\nbusiness, obviously, I still owe my taxes on those capital \\\\ngains, you know, after the deferral period ends, but there&#x27;s an \\\\nadditional benefit that says Hawkins, LLC, that new business, \\\\nif that business goes from a million dollars in value to $10 \\\\nmillion in value, and I hold that business for 20 years, or 11 \\\\nyears, when I sell Hawkins, LLC to, you know, some larger \\\\ncompany, there&#x27;s no capital gains on the $9 million.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Okay.\\\\n    We&#x27;ll have to whiteboard this, because I&#x27;m not sure that \\\\ncompletely gets my capital to run to the business, to finance \\\\nit, to--so we&#x27;ll walk through that.\\\\n    Mister--is it Tredwell?\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. Tredway.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Tredway.\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. Tredway, yeah.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Or I could just look at--read your \\\\nnameplate. You actually said something--and this is one of my \\\\nfixations for my brothers and sisters here on the Committee. \\\\nThe hundred percent expensing, which we believe may, at least \\\\nin the text from single biggest driver of economic expansion is \\\\na timing effect. You still--you know, if--whether we make you \\\\ndepreciate something in seven years or five years or in one \\\\nday, government still--you still get the same depreciation. \\\\nIt&#x27;s a timing effect. The same thing on research and \\\\ndevelopment. Perversity we have right now is you do research \\\\nand development, you now have to finance it and then later on \\\\nyou get depreciated over the years. So now in today&#x27;s financing \\\\ncosts. So I sort of wish intellectually we could all sort of \\\\nseparate that those types of expensing, it&#x27;s a timing effect \\\\nissue that creates a virtuous capital cycle so you get more \\\\nproductive so you can pay your workers some more.\\\\n    So you see, my personal fixation is, what is the next \\\\ngeneration of jobs really look like? And with that, I yield \\\\nback, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you, Mr. Schweikert. Now recognize a \\\\ngentleman from Kansas, Mr. Estes, for five minutes.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to \\\\nall of our witnesses for being here today. It&#x27;s always great to \\\\nget out of the D.C. Beltway and into diverse communities across \\\\nour great nation to hear directly from Americans who are helped \\\\nor harmed by the policies that we write or vote on.\\\\n    While today&#x27;s hearing focuses on the success of good \\\\npolicy, namely Opportunity Zones that were implemented in the \\\\nRepublicans Tax Cuts and Jobs act in 2017, I want to take some \\\\ntime to highlight a few other areas ripe for strong policy \\\\naction from this committee that can help communities in the \\\\nRust Belt and beyond.\\\\n    We know that nearly all Americans in every tax bracket saw \\\\ntax relief thanks to the TCJA. The legislation&#x27;s business \\\\nprovisions boosted the overall economy. However, many of these \\\\nprovisions have begun to expire, and the rest are set to do so \\\\nin 2025. In fact, President Biden has made it clear that he \\\\nwill let these tax cuts expire, even though doing so means \\\\nviolating his pledge to not raise taxes on anyone making less \\\\nthan $400,000. This means that in my home district, hardworking \\\\nKansans can expect to pay $1,900 more in taxes in 2026.\\\\n    And right here in Erie, Pennsylvania, one estimate is that \\\\nan average of over $1,700 will be paid in additional taxes, \\\\nwhile Americans across the country will face similar or even \\\\ngreater tax increases. This would be on top of the historic \\\\nlevels of inflation that are currently crushing Americans and \\\\nmaking it difficult to meet every day needs. According to the \\\\nCBI data released last week, inflation is up 19.9 percent since \\\\nPresident Biden took office in 2021.\\\\n    Mr. Spore, as a founder and new business owner and as a \\\\nfather, can you tell us how inflation is impacting you both \\\\npersonally and professionally? And how would additional tax \\\\nhikes on office impact you and your company?\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. You know, just to--just to be brief. You know, \\\\nany time I don&#x27;t get to make the decisions with the capital \\\\nthat I&#x27;m earning, you know, I want to be able to make that \\\\ndecision. So it obviously--it gets harder, right? It gets \\\\nharder. You already see that I work a lot of hours. I&#x27;m not \\\\nafraid to work a lot of hours. Couldn&#x27;t imagine adding more to \\\\nthat, so----\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Yeah, and unfortunately, it&#x27;s not just taxes \\\\nthat individuals will feel the paying if TCJA expires. Without \\\\naction from the committee and Congress to extend and strengthen \\\\nthe business provisions in TCJA, businesses will be set back, \\\\nhurting the economy, job creation and workers.\\\\n    We&#x27;ve already seen evidence of this through the expiration \\\\nof the Immediate Research and Development Expensing Provision. \\\\nSince amortization took effect, the growth rate of research and \\\\ndevelopment has slowed dramatically, from a 6.6 percent on \\\\naverage over the previous five years, to less than one-half of \\\\none percent over the last 12 months.\\\\n    As companies spend far less on research development, the \\\\nsector is down by more than 14,000 jobs. Three quarters of \\\\nresearch and development spending is on wages and salaries, \\\\nmaking R&amp;D amortization primarily a jobs issue.\\\\n    Mr. Tredway, as a businessman in the manufacturing space, \\\\ncan you tell us how the exploration of the provisions has \\\\nimpacted Erie Molding Packaging?\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. So for Erie Molded, I mean, again, first tier \\\\nsort of caught us off guard, so immediately we had a tax that \\\\nwe weren&#x27;t expecting. Now, we can of course, depreciate those \\\\nexpenses down the road later, but I need to make those \\\\ndecisions now and have that money to reinvest in my company and \\\\nmy people now. So initially it was money out of our pocket that \\\\nwe were not expecting.\\\\n    Looking to the future, we will still do some R&amp;D, but we&#x27;re \\\\ngoing to look at it differently. It&#x27;s different math now. Now, \\\\nlike I said, for us, 90 percent. It sounds like industry \\\\naverage is 75 percent goes to wages. I know that the more I put \\\\ninto R&amp;D, the more I&#x27;m setting myself up for a higher tax bill \\\\nevery year. And so it&#x27;s going to change the math for us. So \\\\nYeah, it&#x27;s a big problem.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Yeah, which makes it really damaging for your \\\\ncash flow as you highlighted earlier in terms of having to pay \\\\nout of your pocket this year for the research and development \\\\nand then not being able to write that off and on taxes to \\\\nrecoup that expenditure.\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. Yeah, and for small businesses like ours, cash \\\\nflow is just--it&#x27;s everything. So it definitely changes the \\\\narithmetic for us.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Thank you. This Committee knows how important \\\\nimmediate R&amp;D expensing is, which is why in January we passed a \\\\ntax relief for American Families and Workers Act that included \\\\nimmediate R&amp;D expensing. I&#x27;m still hopeful that my colleagues \\\\nin the Senate will take up this legislation. And in the \\\\nmeantime we&#x27;ll keep pushing ahead to ensure provisions are \\\\nrestored and strengthened in 2025 and beyond. Thank you, Mr. \\\\nChairman, and I yield back now as well.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you, Mr. Estes. Now recognize Mr. \\\\nSmucker from Pennsylvania for five minutes.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to be here. This is great, hearing Mr. Whiting and \\\\nseeing what&#x27;s happening in the community here was just so \\\\nwonderful to see the commitment that&#x27;s been made and the \\\\nbenefits that you&#x27;re seeing.\\\\n    I represent Lancaster County in Pennsylvania. As many of \\\\nyou know, Lancaster County is on the other side of the State, \\\\nbut we had a similar--years ago I was in the State Senate and \\\\nthen I&#x27;ve been in Congress now for eight years and Lancaster \\\\ncity was in bad need of revitalization and there was a catalyst \\\\nof business owners there similar to what I&#x27;ve heard here. Who \\\\nreally we started with the convention center and then a \\\\nballpark. And then you saw the effects of that over a period of \\\\nyears and decades of that initial investment, that initial \\\\nrisk, and they also took government help because we just \\\\nsometimes can&#x27;t make any initial project work, but you see the \\\\nbenefits.\\\\n    So really, really great to see similar things happening \\\\nhere and I&#x27;m so glad that the Opportunity Zone is a part of \\\\nthat. I also want to mention the Businessowner, Mr. Tredway, \\\\nMr. Spore, I&#x27;ve been a businessowner for a long time, and \\\\nreally proud of the work that we did in the Tax Cuts and Jobs \\\\nAct and the impact. I appreciate, Mr. Tredway, you mentioned \\\\nthe 20 percent deduction, the 199-A, which is really important \\\\nfor the past three organizations.\\\\n    I do want to go back to something that Ms. Moore said, and \\\\nthat is, you know, some of the individual rates were not \\\\npermanent and I agree, they should be made permanent and, in \\\\nfact, they should have been permanent from the very beginning. \\\\nWe weren&#x27;t able to do that because we didn&#x27;t have enough--we \\\\ndidn&#x27;t have Democrat support, frankly, in the Senate side. So \\\\nwe had to do it through the budget reconciliation process, \\\\nwhich has specific scoring. So were not able to do that. But \\\\nMs. Moore and everyone else will have an opportunity to make \\\\nthose permanent because we&#x27;d like to do that next year.\\\\n    We think it&#x27;s very, very important if we don&#x27;t make these \\\\nprovisions permanent, it will be a big tax increase on the \\\\nmiddle class. It will be a tax increase on small business who \\\\nare generating all the jobs. And so we hope to have that \\\\nopportunity and we hope that&#x27;s done in a bipartisan way where \\\\nwe really make these things permanent. It really should be.\\\\n    So I want to get back, Mr. Tredway, to the 199-A, like, \\\\nwe&#x27;re going to have to build support for that. We&#x27;re going to \\\\nhave people understand, even businessowners understand, the \\\\nimpact of that. How do we build that? And we&#x27;re working right \\\\nnow, we have tax teams that Chairman Smith has put together. We \\\\nwant to take this out, have people understand, the American \\\\npeople really understand the Importance of this policy. Do you \\\\nhave any ideas for us? How do we get out and talk about this?\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. That&#x27;s a great question, because it&#x27;s--you \\\\nknow, it&#x27;s not the most straightforward of all the tax codes, \\\\nright. But it makes a ton of sense. And for small businesses \\\\nlike us to be against corporations, if we don&#x27;t keep that in \\\\nplace we&#x27;re not losing another step on the ladder when it comes \\\\nto how we&#x27;re taxed.\\\\n    So I mean, you know, I know where I talk about taxes the \\\\nmost, just speaking my own experience. A lot of it&#x27;s through \\\\ntrade organizations that I&#x27;m a part of. Trade associations, we \\\\nalways have an accountant that&#x27;s involved who&#x27;s talking about \\\\njust general talking points and how we should be planning for \\\\nthe future, which again can be a challenge because the rules \\\\nchange too often, and make these things permanent. Any local \\\\ntraining associations, there&#x27;s one here in----\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. We&#x27;ll do that. I&#x27;m going to--I&#x27;m going to cut \\\\nyou off because there&#x27;s two additional points I want to make \\\\nand I only got--I have a little bit over a minute. One, I&#x27;d \\\\nlove Mr. Hawkins, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to give you time \\\\nto answer this, but you know, we really want this program to \\\\nimprove and we&#x27;re going to have an opportunity next year to do \\\\nthat. So I&#x27;d love to hear from you. Maybe you can do it later.\\\\n    What would be some of the key things that you think would \\\\nbetter ensure that this program is working for more communities \\\\nlike it&#x27;s worked at Erie. And the other thing I want to be sure \\\\nof is that we&#x27;re incentivizing new dollars that would not have \\\\nbeen invested otherwise. I&#x27;d love to, at some point, hear your \\\\nthoughts on that.\\\\n    And then, Mr. Whiting, I&#x27;d love to hear from you, and I&#x27;ve \\\\nrun out of time, so you won&#x27;t be able to answer either, but one \\\\nof the things we learned in Lancaster, that it was a different \\\\nthing to have all of that new development actually result in \\\\nbetter standard of living for the residents of the city, and \\\\nbetter jobs that residents were taking. And over time, that&#x27;s \\\\nstarting to happen, but we want to find a way to make sure that \\\\nall this new development connects with workers and improves the \\\\nlives of people in the city. So I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts \\\\non that.\\\\n    We don&#x27;t have time. We found--as I said, it took a while \\\\nfor that to occur. And so, Mr. Hawkins, if you could even maybe \\\\nprovide to the Committee, your recommendations of key changes \\\\nthat we should make, and then how do we----\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER [continuing]. Connect that to ensuring that \\\\nwe&#x27;re all residents, not just business owners.\\\\n    Because really, the purpose of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, \\\\nthe purpose of incentivizing business, is to create great jobs \\\\nand to raise the standard of living for the entire community. \\\\nThat&#x27;s what we want to get to. So I&#x27;d love to hear from both of \\\\nyou, maybe, how that&#x27;s worked here, and what ideas that we have \\\\nto ensure that happens. So, thank you. Sorry I went over time, \\\\nMr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. No, Mr. Smucker, you know, because we&#x27;re so \\\\nlimited, five minutes isn&#x27;t really enough, but I hope this just \\\\nbegins a dialogue that you feel comfortable doing with us. \\\\nBecause the Chairman&#x27;s idea to begin with was to take the \\\\nCongress out into the country so you could have a face-to-face \\\\ntalk back and forth. And I think what Mr. Smucker just talked \\\\nabout, there&#x27;s so much more that we have to be able to sit down \\\\nand talk about to see where you all are in this, and how we can \\\\nmake the government truly work for you.\\\\n    I now recognize the Gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Van Duyne.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much. It&#x27;s great to be here \\\\nin Erie today. And Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for \\\\nhosting us.\\\\n    Congressional Republicans know that pro-growth tax policies \\\\nwork for American families, for workers, and for small \\\\nbusinesses, and following the 2017 Trump tax cuts, individuals \\\\nand families reaped the benefits. Real wages grew by 4.9 \\\\npercent in 2018 and 2019. Fastest two-year growth in real wages \\\\nin 20 years.\\\\n    Similarly, from 2017 to 2019, more than 6.6 million people \\\\nwere lifted out of poverty, dropping the poverty rates to 10.5 \\\\npercent, the lowest level in U.S. history. The Real Median U.S. \\\\nHousehold Income in 2019 rose nearly 50 percent more than \\\\nduring eight years under President Obama&#x27;s leadership. And \\\\naccording to the Federal Reserve, low and middle-income \\\\nfamilies received the largest increase in wealth during 2018 \\\\nand 2019.\\\\n    And I don&#x27;t want to disagree with my Democrat colleague, \\\\nbut when they talk about the $400,000 that people make not \\\\nhaving taxes raised on them, I would argue that according to \\\\nthe Congressional Budget Office, that the tax cuts that were \\\\nsigned in the law by then President Donald Trump that are said \\\\nto expire, that if they do expire, the vast majority of U.S., \\\\nthe vast majority of U.S. households would see their payments \\\\nto the IRS increase. That the Trump&#x27;s 2017 overhaul cut the \\\\ncorporate tax rate of 21 percent, intending to make it more \\\\ncompetitive internationally. The law also temporarily cut the \\\\nincome taxes paid by most U.S. households, in part by trimming \\\\nmarginal tax rates and increasing the standard deduction.\\\\n    As a result of these changes, Non-Partisan Tax Policy \\\\nCenter estimated a family of 40th to 60th percentile of earners \\\\nwould average save $930 annually.\\\\n    And when we talk about the $400,000 as a mark, the fact \\\\nthat we&#x27;re facing now 20 percent inflation means that has \\\\neroded Biden&#x27;s promise on wage increases and it&#x27;s pushed more \\\\npeople from $400,000 tax bracket. So a salary of $330,000 now \\\\nwould be worth $400,000 in today&#x27;s dollars. So that needs to be \\\\ntaken into account. But in the face of major tax sites and \\\\nlooming sunsets, republicans will take action to ensure that \\\\nAmerican families and small businesses are not hit at higher \\\\ntax rates or watered-down guaranteed deduction in child tax \\\\ncredit that&#x27;s cut in half.\\\\n    I&#x27;m excited to work on the tax teams that this Committee \\\\nhas put together and ensure we help create growth for small \\\\nbusinesses, such as the ones we saw today. One of the areas I \\\\nwant to address is looking at how small businesses access \\\\ncapital and threats we see from this administration. We even \\\\nsaw this a few weeks ago from the Treasury, who repeated \\\\nmisguided attacks on carried interest loophole. We&#x27;ve also seen \\\\nin every single budget that&#x27;s been put out by this president.\\\\n    Mr. Whiting, you stated a venture fund--you started a \\\\nventure fund to help provide capital to small startup \\\\ncompanies, to start companies. Can you discuss the challenges \\\\nsome of these small businesses face and what would happen if we \\\\nallow the 2017 tax cuts to expire?\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. So the challenges that they face are in \\\\ngetting the risk capital needed to grow. Not at the very early \\\\nstage, not when they&#x27;ve reached a point of somewhat success in \\\\nproduct market fit, but it&#x27;s really in that--IN THAT space \\\\nwhere they need angel investors and community investors to come \\\\nto the aide of those companies. In 2014, I helped with some \\\\ndraft legislation for the Illinois Angel Investment Tax Credit, \\\\nand I brought that up to people in Pennsylvania when we were \\\\nthere down Harrisburg last week. That kind of tax credit could \\\\nbe something that&#x27;s really useful for everybody in this country \\\\nand could be a federal-type of thing.\\\\n    I would encourage additional investment in those businesses \\\\nat those times. As far as the sunsetting of some of the TCJA \\\\nprovisions, I think Opportunity Zone funds can be used as a \\\\npredicate to getting capital of any small businesses. It is not \\\\nlimited to real estate at the moment. There are restrictions, \\\\nbut I think that can be expanded.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. All right. Thank you. Mr. Tredway, we \\\\ncontinue to see proposals from this Administration, such as \\\\nchanging the long-term capital gains and qualified dividends of \\\\nthe ordinary income work for taxpayers, which could potentially \\\\ndouble the tax rate from 20 percent to 39.6 percent.\\\\n    How detrimental would this change be for small businesses \\\\nlooking to access capital?\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. I mean, it would be a significant impact on \\\\ncompanies like ours. You know, you&#x27;re--again, you&#x27;re taking \\\\nthat much capital, that much cash out of where we want to put \\\\nit back into business, back in our people, back in capital and \\\\nnow we have to give it to the federal government. And that&#x27;s \\\\nmoney we need to do to remain competitive, not against, just \\\\nagainst corporations who aren&#x27;t pass- through companies, but \\\\nalso, of course, international. We don&#x27;t compete in a vacuum, \\\\nwe compete globally. So it would be a major impact.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Spore, in the few seconds I have left, \\\\nwe&#x27;ve also seen interest rates at a 30-year high. Can you tell \\\\nme how that has affected your business in having given access \\\\nto capital?\\\\n    Mr. SPORE. I haven&#x27;t had to do that.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Okay.\\\\n    You haven&#x27;t had--Mr. Tredway, can you tell me how small \\\\nbusinesses have been affected by the highest interest rates \\\\nwe&#x27;ve seen in three decades?\\\\n    Mr. TREDWAY. It makes the loan payments a lot different. \\\\nAnd again, it&#x27;s factoring in the decisions that we&#x27;re--you \\\\nknow, borrowing a million dollars looks a lot different today \\\\nthan it does before, so, you know, a couple years ago. So now \\\\nwe have to--we aren&#x27;t investing probably quite as much as we \\\\nhave in the past, you know, before interest rates start to go--\\\\nhike up as much as they have.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you. The General Lady from New York, \\\\nMs. Malliotakis for five minutes.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. \\\\nOpportunity Zones and Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by the \\\\nRepublican Congress with President Donald Trump were pro-\\\\ngrowth, pro-jobs policies that benefit the American people and \\\\nbusinesses. We saw real wages grow by 4.9 percent in the first \\\\ntwo years that followed, making it the fastest two-year growth \\\\nin two decades. 6.6 million Americans were lifted out of \\\\npoverty, dropping the poverty rate to 10.5 percent, the lowest \\\\nlevel in American history. And in 2019, the Real Median \\\\nHousehold Income rose nearly 50 percent more than during the \\\\neight years of the Obama/Biden Administration.\\\\n    But state politics matter just as much, and according to \\\\nthe Tax foundation, state business climate in my home state of \\\\nNew York is number 49, 49th Worst out of 50. Here in \\\\nPennsylvania, it&#x27;s 31. My State, New York, is home to 514 \\\\nOpportunity Zones and my District is home to 13 Opportunity \\\\nZones; eight on Staten Island, five in Brooklyn. All of the \\\\nStaten Island&#x27;s Opportunity Zones are located in the lower \\\\nincome, mostly minority sections of the Staten Island&#x27;s North \\\\nShore, which can desperately use the private investment and \\\\nrevitalization, which is the exact point of the program. But \\\\nthe lawmakers in Albany have prevented New York&#x27;s Opportunity \\\\nZones from achieving their full potential.\\\\n    In 2021, New York stripped some of the state level tax \\\\nbenefits created under the federal program, but left in a tax \\\\nexemption on capital gains from opportunities on investments \\\\nthat were held for at least ten years. Last Monday, the State \\\\nSenate voted, however, 41 to 20, to approximately approve the \\\\nmeasure of fully decoupling the state from the Opportunity \\\\nZones program. And these are the same people that drove out the \\\\npotential Amazon headquarters out of, you know, Queens, even \\\\nafter the company said they would not reap the benefits of the \\\\ndeferred tax.\\\\n    So my question is to Mr. Hawkins, can you help my lawmakers \\\\nin the State of New York understand what they&#x27;re missing out \\\\non?\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Right. What I would impress upon the state \\\\nlegislature there is that it is absolutely critical for the \\\\nsuccess of the policy. And when I say success, I mean in terms \\\\nof benefiting the lives across a number of economic measures of \\\\nthe existing residents of Opportunity Zones, that they \\\\nimplement supportive local legislation to make sure that the \\\\npolicy is effective as possible.\\\\n    When Congress passed Opportunity Zones, they gave governors \\\\nwho were designating the zones, who were picking the places \\\\nwhere this investment could occur, three non-binding criteria \\\\nfor picking the zones. The first was an area where there was \\\\nsignificant economic distress, areas that have been disrupted \\\\nthrough technology changes or outsourcing or those kinds of \\\\nthings.\\\\n    Second, they asked--they asked governors to look for areas \\\\nwhere there was opportunity, where an investor could turn a \\\\ndollar into five dollars. And third, they asked governors to \\\\nlook at areas where there could be usually reinforcing state, \\\\nlocal and federal policy that could really help target these \\\\ninvestments in the area where they need it most. And so certain \\\\nstates have been very aggressive.\\\\n    Next door in Ohio, our government implemented a 10 percent \\\\nstate income tax credit that can be literally sold at 80 cents \\\\non the dollar for all investment in Opportunity Zones. That \\\\nallows us two things. One, it drives a lot of investment into \\\\nthe most distressed areas. But second, it allows the state of \\\\nOhio to track opportunities on investment all across the state \\\\nin the absence of federal reporting requirements.\\\\n    And so, I mean, I would emphasize the legislature there in \\\\nNew York that this is a great policy that&#x27;s changing lives and \\\\nthey should absolutely support it----\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. And the private investment outweighs the \\\\ncosts of the state, number one.\\\\n    Mr. HAWKINS. Absolutely.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. And you&#x27;re creating jobs in these \\\\ndepressed communities, number two. We saw Mr. Whiting today; \\\\nappreciate the tour you gave us. We&#x27;re seeing the private \\\\ninvestment, the buildings that have been revitalized now \\\\noccupied, the jobs, and the shops, and the housing and tax \\\\nrevenue is coming not by hammering people over the head like \\\\nthey&#x27;re ATM machines. It&#x27;s actually coming because the \\\\ncommunity is more prosperous and there&#x27;s more tax revenue as a \\\\nresult.\\\\n    So my last question is for Mr. Spore.\\\\n    You&#x27;re absolutely right when you say New York City has the \\\\nbest pizza. We&#x27;d love to know those two restaurants. You can \\\\ntell me after. You don&#x27;t have to say it on the mic. But thank \\\\nyou very much and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you for letting us know where the \\\\nbest pizza is.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. It&#x27;s got to be from Brooklyn and Staten \\\\nIsland, that&#x27;s for sure.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you, Ms. Malliotakis. Next, Ms. \\\\nMiller from West Virginia for five minutes, please.\\\\n    Ms. MILLER. Thank you. I think I&#x27;m at the tail end as a \\\\nmatter of fact.\\\\n    I&#x27;m Carol Miller from West Virginia. I was born and raised \\\\nin Columbus, Ohio. For those of you who think about that, for \\\\nsome strange reason, I think it must be Kismet, I decided not \\\\nto go to Ohio State, but to go to a small women&#x27;s college in \\\\nColumbia, South Carolina. I met my West Virginian in South \\\\nCarolina 51 years later. I love West Virginia. I love the \\\\npeople. And a lot of you in this room probably have relatives \\\\neither in Southern Pennsylvania or in West Virginia. We are \\\\nvery much the same people.\\\\n    I think we&#x27;ve established the importance of keeping the Tax \\\\ncuts and Jobs Act. It&#x27;s so important and what&#x27;s coming ahead. \\\\nI&#x27;m a small businessowner. I shake my head. I mean, I bought \\\\napartments when I still had kids in diapers. I painted them \\\\nwhen I couldn&#x27;t afford somebody else to do it. I&#x27;ve been ankle \\\\ndeep in sump pump water. I&#x27;ve had my hands down the back of \\\\ntoilets.\\\\n    I&#x27;m a businessowner. I&#x27;m an LLC. I am not a bad person for \\\\nbeing a corporation. And I can remember those huge printouts \\\\nevery time I had to make a payment, I&#x27;d mark it off. My \\\\ninterest was huge. My principal was like $45 month after month \\\\nafter month. People who make policy don&#x27;t often understand the \\\\nrisk that people in business take. Small businesses in \\\\nparticular. And those small business people are the ones that \\\\nsupport the Little League teams, that help the Boy Scouts and \\\\nGirl Scouts. They&#x27;re the ones that are reinvesting in their \\\\npeople and in their community.\\\\n    West Virginia is about 95 percent small businesses. So now \\\\nI&#x27;ll go back to my notes. I do represent rural West Virginia, \\\\nand we live in a community that&#x27;s very similar here. When I \\\\nmoved from Columbus, Ohio, we had 600,000 people and my \\\\ncommunity had about 90. And I thought, what a charming small \\\\ntown. There are 50,000 people in my city right now.\\\\n    We have suffered from bad policy and bad ideas, but like \\\\nthese Opportunity Zones, they have become a very effective tool \\\\nto help investment in our communities. I saw our glass plants. \\\\nI saw so many plants leaving in the 1980s and in the 1990s \\\\nbecause of policy. So it&#x27;s so important that we do what we do.\\\\n    I&#x27;m an original Co-sponsor of Chairman Kelly&#x27;s Opportunity \\\\nZones and Transparency Extension and Improvement Act, and I \\\\nstrongly support it. Mr. Hawkins, thank you for working to help \\\\ndevelop the Opportunity Zone policies. You know, we&#x27;ve seen the \\\\nimpact in our communities across the country, and it&#x27;s really \\\\ngreat to be here in Pennsylvania and drive around in this \\\\nbeautiful town and see the before, the during and the after. \\\\nI&#x27;m very impressed with that.\\\\n    So I do want you, Mr. Hawkins, to give us some of your \\\\nwonderful ideas on how we can do better and how we can target \\\\nin our communities. And I know we probably don&#x27;t have enough \\\\ntime for you to give us those pearls, because I&#x27;ve heard some \\\\nof the things you&#x27;ve said, but it&#x27;s just so, so important that, \\\\nyou know, we benefit from these Opportunity Zones.\\\\n    Mr. Whiting, thank you for being here. And I&#x27;m impressed \\\\nwhat I heard about Erie&#x27;s development today, and, you know, got \\\\nto be with you earlier in the day. We&#x27;re developing--\\\\nredeveloping Huntington and Charleston along our main streets \\\\nin our town. Can you explain how long it&#x27;s taken for Erie to \\\\nsee the benefits of the Opportunity Zone program and why it&#x27;s \\\\nso important that it should be extended?\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. We&#x27;re at the beginning of our seventh year of \\\\naction on this right now.\\\\n    Ms. MILLER. Seventh.\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. And I would say that we&#x27;re probably a year \\\\nand-a-half into seeing some of these benefits. It does take a \\\\nwhile. That&#x27;s because development takes some time and for the \\\\neffects to take hold after that, will take time as well. We \\\\nneed more time.\\\\n    Ms. MILLER. Well, housing is also a big issue in West \\\\nVirginia and in my district and we do have access to more \\\\nrecent data which indicates that OZ&#x27;s have had such a \\\\nsignificant impact on adding to our housing supply. And so, you \\\\nknow, it&#x27;s up from eight percent before designation. So we also \\\\nknow that this new activity has a positive spillover in our \\\\nneighboring communities.\\\\n    Can you also speak about your experiences of using OZ&#x27;s to \\\\naddress the housing shortage here in Erie?\\\\n    Mr. WHITING. Yeah. Our OZ work has resulted in about 110 \\\\nnew apartments where 14 existed prior. It&#x27;s also spurred on \\\\nadditional activity that has led to efforts at more supportive \\\\nand low-income affordable housing around the community. We have \\\\nsomething to work for here now. This is a place worth investing \\\\nin. This is a place worth creating new housing in now. And so \\\\nthe organizations like the Hammond Health Foundation, the \\\\nCommunity foundation are doing that work, and I&#x27;m not sure that \\\\nthere would be the impetus to do it ten years ago.\\\\n    Ms. MILLER. I agree with you. And Mr. Spore, I want some \\\\nIppa. Thank you all of you for being here and taking the time \\\\ntoday. We really appreciate it. God Bless you.\\\\n    Chairman KELLY. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. \\\\nJust before we quit, I was just talking with the Chairman. So \\\\nthis is a tenth meeting we&#x27;ve had. and his idea from day one \\\\nwas to take the Committee out of Washington and take it to the \\\\ncountry so that you can have face-to-face contact; you could \\\\nactually have dialogue, you could give us your true feelings on \\\\nthings. I think if there&#x27;s one thing missing today, it is our \\\\ninability to communicate with each other on a calm level, \\\\nactually exchange ideas. What&#x27;s in the best interest of people \\\\nwe represent?\\\\n    By the way, there are quite a few elected officials here \\\\ntoday. They&#x27;re all sitting in on this. I appreciate you all \\\\nbeing here. And where is Barry Copple? Barry&#x27;s in the back of \\\\nthe room. Raise your hand, okay, so we can say hi to you. There \\\\nhe is. There&#x27;s Barry Copple. Now why do I bring that up? We&#x27;ve \\\\nhad an opportunity to go through the most magnificent building \\\\nand people say, well, how the heck did they do this? Now \\\\nremember that the Warner Brothers started this in 1929. Not the \\\\nbest year for the economy in American history.\\\\n    Now I thought it&#x27;s fascinating because we talk about \\\\ninflation. The Warner Brothers invested $1.5 million in the \\\\nconstruction of this magnificent building with memories that \\\\nlast forever when they replaced the front marquee, the cost of \\\\nreplacing the marquee, just the marquee, was $1.5 million. So \\\\nthat&#x27;s inflation, but you all being here, the tenth meeting \\\\nwe&#x27;ve had around the country, I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ve had a \\\\nbetter turnout than this, and I want you to understand that if \\\\nyou have something to add----\\\\n    So we have--I&#x27;ll read this to you because it&#x27;s important \\\\nthat you know this. Please be advised that members have two \\\\nweeks to submit written questions and be answered later in \\\\nwriting. I want to tell the people that are here, we&#x27;re going \\\\nto be here for a few minutes. If you want to have any type of a \\\\nconversation with us, please don&#x27;t be shy. I&#x27;ve been in Erie. \\\\nI&#x27;m kind of used to this after 12 years, none of you are shy. \\\\nPlease don&#x27;t hesitate to interact with us.\\\\n    But to my colleagues, I thank you all for being here today. \\\\nThis was really, really important to us, important to this \\\\nCommittee and congratulations on everything you&#x27;ve done.

Before we get started, I would like to \\\\nrecognize myself. If you will rise, we will say the prayer and \\\\nthe pledge.\\\\n    Heavenly father, God of all people, thank you for allowing \\\\nus to meet today and the [inaudible.] to share great thanks for \\\\nour great country. Thank you for being with all of us the best \\\\nday of our lives. In your name we pray. Amen.\\\\n    Join me in the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the Flag of \\\\nthe United States of America, and to the Republic for which it \\\\nstands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and \\\\njustice for all.\\\\n    Good morning to everybody and I now call the Committee on \\\\nSmall Business to order. I am authorized to declare recess of \\\\nCommittee at any time.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for my opening statement and I want \\\\nto welcome today&#x27;s hearing all of you again for being here, \\\\nwhere we will be focusing on the current economic realities \\\\nimpacting Main Street America. These types of hearing are \\\\nespecially important to our Committee because we get the chance \\\\nto hear directly from our small businesses back home.\\\\n    First, I want to thank our witnesses for being here today. \\\\nI know all of you have traveled a long way, some as far as \\\\nTexas, to share your stories with us and everyone here greatly \\\\nappreciates it.\\\\n    This Committee serves as the voice for Main Street America \\\\nin Washington. Each and every day, we strive to learn more \\\\nabout the current state of small business from the people who \\\\nknow it best, our nation&#x27;s job creators. There is no doubt that \\\\nin the first half of 2024, they have experienced many ups and \\\\ndowns. I hold the opinion of starting a small business is the \\\\ndefinition of the American Dream. Part of what makes America so \\\\nspecial is it is a place where anyone from any background can \\\\ntake a risk, bet on themselves and bring a new service or \\\\nproduct to the marketplace.\\\\n    Our economy is dependent upon small businesses. And it is \\\\nour job here in Washington to ensure that they have a fighting \\\\nchance. Unfortunately, many small businesses are dealing with a \\\\nvariety of challenges, many of which are the result of a bad \\\\npolicy decisions.\\\\n    Main Street America has been getting bombarded with \\\\nregulations that are causing small business firms to play \\\\ndefense. Just look at the numbers. Since President Biden took \\\\noffice, his administration has instituted new rules that are \\\\nestimated to cost over $1.6 trillion. Every dollar spent on \\\\nadditional compliance staff could have been used to bolster \\\\ntheir core operations, and every hour dedicated to reading and \\\\nunderstanding the new regulations that have been used to \\\\ndiscover new growth and opportunities. And worst of all, when a \\\\nbusiness owner fears expensive new mandates just beyond the \\\\nhorizon they hold up hiring that extra employee, or buying that \\\\nnew piece of equipment.\\\\n    America&#x27;s entrepreneurs have had to confront historic \\\\nchallenges, the COVID-19 pandemic, out-of-control inflation, \\\\nbroken supply chains, high interest rates and labor shortages \\\\nis making it hard to find quality employees. But as small \\\\nbusinesses have done countless times before, they have endured. \\\\nThose of us here in Washington must fight back against these \\\\npolicies which have been strangling America&#x27;s job creators.\\\\n    As we listen to the state of small business in America, we \\\\nsalute the entrepreneurs who continue to fight and give \\\\nselflessly back to their communities. This committee is here to \\\\nhelp them and make life a little bit easier and we mean that, \\\\nwe really do.\\\\n    I am excited to have all of you here with us today. And I \\\\nam very much looking forward to today&#x27;s hearing.\\\\n    With that, I will yield for opening remarks. Congressman \\\\nChu, please.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for this important \\\\nopportunity to discuss the realities of our economy and hear \\\\nfrom those who do incredible work directly in the communities \\\\nwe represent. Hearings like this allows us to take stock of how \\\\nour efforts in Congress effect those on main street.\\\\n    Four years ago, small businesses had to navigate an \\\\nunprecedented array of challenges stemming from the COVID-19 \\\\npandemic from public health shutdowns to supply chain \\\\ndisruptions, labor shortages and rising costs. Yet, despite \\\\nthese obstacles, small businesses have demonstrated \\\\nextraordinary resilience.\\\\n    Obstacles remain, but our strong economic headline numbers \\\\nclearly show slowing inflation, low unemployment and sustained \\\\ngrowth. Looking around there is much to be proud of. We have \\\\nseen a remarkable surge in small business creation since 2020, \\\\nreversing decades of decline. It has become clear this isn&#x27;t \\\\njust an anomaly due to the pandemic, it is a trend that is \\\\ncontinuing, even today, 4 years later. This terrible small \\\\nbusiness boon shows that so many Americans still have hope for \\\\nthe future and trust that we are moving in the right direction.\\\\n    The ripples of the current startup boom will reverberate \\\\nfor decades, delivering wealth creation for families, \\\\nopportunities for its workers, and economic development for \\\\ncommunities across the country.\\\\n    This is especially significant because many who have \\\\nhistorically been underrepresented in the business community, \\\\nincluding women and minority business owners, are the ones who \\\\ndisproportionately power this small business boom, and reap the \\\\nbroad benefits delivered when we build the economy from the \\\\nbottom up and the middle out.\\\\n    The resilience in our economy continues to overcome \\\\nheadwinds, primarily because of investments made by the \\\\nDemocratic Congress and the Biden-Harris administration over \\\\nthe past several years. This transformational fiscal policy \\\\nstarted with the American Rescue Plan, which played a critical \\\\nrole in stabilizing our economy during the pandemic. By \\\\nextending support to small businesses and providing direct \\\\nstimulus to American families we kept millions of businesses \\\\nafloat, all while providing relief to the unemployed and \\\\ncutting child poverty in half through the expanded Child Tax \\\\nCredit.\\\\n    This was complemented by historic bipartisan legislation \\\\nwhen we passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and \\\\nthe CHIPS and Science Act--two landmark laws that are providing \\\\nlong-term investments to strengthen our supply chains, rebuild \\\\nour country&#x27;s road and bridges, and lay the foundation for a \\\\nmore resilient and inclusive economy. These investments are \\\\nsupporting the growth and the flourishing of small firms and \\\\nnew startups.\\\\n    Finally, Democrats and the Biden Harris administration pass \\\\nthe Inflation Reduction Act which included the largest ever \\\\ninvestment in fighting climate change and provisions to further \\\\nincentivize domestic manufacturing and lower cost for \\\\neverything from healthcare to electricity.\\\\n    While there is no doubt these laws will provide a boost for \\\\nsmall firms into the foreseeable future, there is still much \\\\nmore to be done.\\\\n    Access to capital remains a challenge, and the high cost of \\\\nborrowing poses a long-term threat to small businesses. In this \\\\nhigh interest rate environment, SBA&#x27;s capital access programs \\\\nare especially important for connecting small businesses to \\\\naffordable financing.\\\\n    Additionally, the government can continue to do more to \\\\nincentivize innovation from reversing disastrous provisions of \\\\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to extending our core SBA programs, \\\\nincluding SBIR and STTR.\\\\n    Finally, investments in families will continue to \\\\nstrengthen small businesses, whether it is the expanded Child \\\\nTax Credit or continued investment in childcare, these actions \\\\ncan help build a more sustainable and resilient business \\\\nenvironment, while delivering for American families. It is \\\\ncrucial that we continue to support these business through \\\\nthoughtful legislation.\\\\n    While the accomplishments of Democrats in Congress and the \\\\nBiden-Harris administration have provided a strong foundation, \\\\nwe must continue to build on this progress, ensuring that small \\\\nbusinesses can thrive in a stable and supportive economic \\\\nenvironment.\\\\n    Thank you, and I look forward to our discussion today. And \\\\nI yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    And I will now introduce our witnesses. Our first witness \\\\nhere with us today is Ms. Hazel Davis. Ms. Davis is the vice \\\\npresident, compliance manager and corporate responsibility \\\\nofficer for Jefferson Bank, located in San Antonio, Texas. Ms. \\\\nDavis joined Jefferson Bank in 2013 as vice president of fair \\\\nlending and CRA officer before transitioning to her current \\\\nposition because of her regulatory compliance expertise.

I want to thank you for \\\\nbeing with us today and I am looking forward to today&#x27;s \\\\nimportant conversation.\\\\n    Our next witness here with us today is Mr. Steve Martinez. \\\\nMr. Martinez is the president of Tradewinds and General \\\\nContracting, Incorporated located in Boise, Ohio. Founded by \\\\nhis parents in 1980 Tradewinds and General Contracting has \\\\nalways been a part of Mr. Martinez&#x27;s life, whether it was \\\\ncompleting a small task as a kid, up to framing houses in \\\\ncollege.\\\\n    After graduating from college, Mr. Martinez began working \\\\nfor the business full-time, becoming president after 6 years \\\\nwith the company. Mr. Martinez has won numerous awards, \\\\nincluding builder of the year multiple times from both local \\\\nand State building associations, and has received recognition \\\\nfrom the National Association of Home Builders. Mr. Martinez \\\\ngraduated from Boise State University, home of the Broncos, \\\\nright, with a bachelor of business administration. I want to \\\\nthank you for being here today and I look forward to our \\\\nconversation.\\\\n    Our next witness here with us today is J.D. Ewing. Mr. \\\\nEwing is the Chairman and CEO of COE Distributing, located in \\\\nSmock, Pennsylvania. COE Distributing is the largest wholesale \\\\noffice furniture distributor in the U.S. and the Caribbean.

Mr. Ewing graduated from \\\\nPenn State University where he studied business. Thank you for \\\\njoining with us today and look forward to our conversation.\\\\n    And I now recognize the Ranking Member Chu to introduce the \\\\nlast witness appearing before us today.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am so honored to introduce \\\\nour final witness today, my constituent, Tom McCarthy, the co-\\\\nfounder and vice president of business development at Motiv \\\\nSpace Systems, which is located in Pasadena, of course, in my \\\\ndistrict. Tom spent 11 years at NASA&#x27;s JPL, also in my \\\\ndistrict. And he is an electronics engineer designing motion \\\\ncontrol systems for rovers and robotic systems for extreme \\\\nenvironments. He then spent 4 years as the director of business \\\\ndevelopment at the Missile Defense Agency before cofounding \\\\nMotiv in 2024.\\\\n    Motiv was founded on the belief that space-based robotic \\\\nsystems could be produced more efficiently and with a higher \\\\nlevel of quality by a small business and they were quickly \\\\nproven right. They earned and successfully executed a range of \\\\ncontracts at NASA, including designing the robotic arm used on \\\\nthe Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover. They are also the recipients \\\\nof several SBIR awards from the SBA and are using that \\\\ninvestment to innovate the next generation of space \\\\nexploration.\\\\n    Thank you for joining us, Mr. McCarthy.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. And again, thank you all for being here \\\\ntoday. And before recognizing the witnesses, I would like to \\\\nremind them that oral testimony is restricted to 5 minutes in \\\\nlength. That is a big number for us, we want to stick with \\\\nthat.\\\\n    If you see the light turn red in front of you, that means \\\\nyour 5 minutes is up. And you should conclude your remarks \\\\nimmediately. And if you keep going, you are going to hear this. \\\\nThat means stop, okay? And so with that in mind, I now \\\\nrecognize Ms. Davis for her 5-minute opening remarks.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENTS OF HAZEL DAVIS, VICE PRESIDENT, COMPLIANCE MANAGER &amp; \\\\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY OFFICER, JEFFERSON BANK, ON BEHALF OF \\\\n    TEXAS BANKERS&#x27; ASSOCIATION; STEVE MARTINEZ, PRESIDENT, \\\\n  TRADEWINDS GENERAL CONTRACTING, INC., ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL \\\\n  ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS OF THE UNITED STATES; JAMES D. \\\\n  EWING, JR., CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, COE DISTRIBUTING, ON BEHALF OF \\\\n   JMJS, INC AND COE DISTRIBUTING; AND TOM MCCARTHY, VP, CO-\\\\nFOUNDER, MOTIV SPACE SYSTEMS, ON BEHALF OF MOTIV SPACE SYSTEMS.\\\\n\\\\n                    STATEMENT OF HAZEL DAVIS\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Thank you, Chairman Williams, distinguished \\\\nMembers of the Committee, my name is Hazel Davis, I am vice \\\\npresident, compliance manager and corporate responsibility \\\\nofficer for Jefferson Bank, a cornerstone of the San Antonio \\\\ncommunity since 1946. With assets totaling approximately $3 \\\\nbillion, we serve the dynamic and growing region of San \\\\nAntonio-Austin, which encompasses 4.8 million people. We \\\\nspecialize in commercial lending and consumer mortgages.\\\\n    San Antonio, a city where 64 percent of residents are \\\\nHispanic, thrives on the entrepreneurial spirit of 34,000 small \\\\nbusinesses and 145,000 sole proprietorships. These businesses \\\\nare the lifeblood of our economy, facing challenges such as \\\\nworkforce shortages, rising costs of materials, and housing \\\\naffordability constraints. And yet, despite these hurdles, we \\\\ncontinue to see robust demand for credit, although higher \\\\ninterest rates have impacted some of our price sensitive \\\\ncustomers.\\\\n    As a compliance officer and advocate for the community I \\\\nhave witnessed firsthand the profound impact that economic \\\\nshifts and regulatory measures have on access to credit. Today, \\\\nI am before you not only as a representative of a small \\\\nbusiness, but also as a voice for the Texas Bankers Association \\\\nwhich represents 375 banks across our State, employing over \\\\n218,000 individuals. Community banks like ours play a pivotal \\\\nrole in supporting small businesses. We understand the local \\\\nlandscape intimately, offering personalized service and \\\\nflexible terms that larger institutions often cannot.\\\\n    Our commitment goes beyond transactions, it is about \\\\nfostering relationships and ensuring our borrowers succeed. \\\\nThis approach not only drives economic growth, but also, \\\\nstrengthens the social fabric of our communities. In my opinion \\\\nfinancial literacy remains a significant barrier for aspiring \\\\nentrepreneurs. In my experience many start with personal funds \\\\nbefore seeking formal credit, often unaware of the long-term \\\\nramifications if not utilized appropriately.\\\\n    As a fair lending officer, I have reviewed numerous loan \\\\napplications where a lack of financial acumen has proven \\\\ndetrimental. Community banks are dedicated to bridging gaps \\\\nthrough education and targeted support programs, ensuring that \\\\nall entrepreneurs have the tools required to succeed.\\\\n    The Community Reinvestment Act is instrumental in our \\\\nefforts emphasizing the importance of equitable and fair access \\\\nto credit. Proposed revisions must strengthen, not dilute, \\\\nsupport for underserved communities and foster small business \\\\ngrowth.\\\\n    In San Antonio, historical disinvestment in specific areas \\\\nhas left lasting scars, breeding mistrust of traditional \\\\nfinancial institutions and minority communities.\\\\n    Through proactive engagement and targeted investments, we \\\\nwork tirelessly to rebuild trust and forge lasting \\\\npartnerships. However, escalating regulatory burdens and \\\\ncompliance costs threaten our ability to continue these efforts \\\\nas every dollar devoted to regulatory compliance is a dollar \\\\nless reinvested into our community businesses.\\\\n    In conclusion, I urge the committee to consider the \\\\nunintended consequences of regulatory actions on small \\\\nbusinesses by fostering a regulatory environment that supports \\\\nfair lending access, as well as small businesses, such as my \\\\ninstitution, and recognizing the unique needs of commercial \\\\nlending and promoting financial literacy. Together, we can pave \\\\nthe way for vibrant small business ecosystems to continue to \\\\ngrow.\\\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am \\\\ncommitted, along with you, to enabling, rather than hindering, \\\\nthe success of small businesses across our great nation.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Let me just say one thing to all of you, \\\\nyou are going to see Members move in and out, it has no effect \\\\non your testimony or anything, we have other hearings they will \\\\ngo to and come back, so that is the reason you may see that.\\\\n    Next, I want to recognize Mr. Martinez for his 5-minute \\\\nopening remarks.\\\\n\\\\n                  STATEMENT OF STEVE MARTINEZ\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Thank you, Chair. Chairman Williams and \\\\ndistinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to testify on the current economic landscape in \\\\nAmerica. Housing is, by far, the largest single expense for the \\\\nAmerican household. And rising costs are putting the nation in \\\\nan ever-worsening situation.\\\\n    A 2024 report by Harvard&#x27;s Joint Center for Housing Studies \\\\nfound that record high 22.4 million Americans are paying more \\\\nthan 30 percent of their income on rent. And more than 12 \\\\nmillion are paying more than half of their incomes.\\\\n    A newly released housing affordability index by NAHB shows \\\\nthat in the first quarter of 2024, 38 percent of a typical \\\\nfamily&#x27;s income was needed to make a mortgage payment on a \\\\nmedium-priced single-family home. Shelter inflation and rent \\\\nand ownership cost is still rising well above a 5 percent rate \\\\ndriven, in large part, by a nationwide shortage of about 1.5 \\\\nmillion housing units. The only way to tame inflation and ease \\\\nthe nation&#x27;s housing affordability crisis is to build more \\\\nhomes.\\\\n    In order to increase the inventory of a single-family home \\\\nand multifamily housing we must remove more barriers; \\\\nregulatory barriers, labor barriers and supply chain barriers, \\\\nthat are preventing home builders from increasing housing \\\\nproduction.\\\\n    Regulatory barriers, which include complying with building \\\\ncodes make up nearly 25 percent of the cost of a single-family \\\\nhome, and more than 40 percent of an apartment home. Without \\\\nadequate review or consideration of how it will affect home \\\\nbuyers or renters, HUD and USDA recently issued a mandate that \\\\nwill require all HUD and USDA financed housing to be built to \\\\nthe 2021 energy code. This will do little to curb overall \\\\nenergy use, but will worsen the housing affordability crisis \\\\nand hurt the nation&#x27;s most vulnerable house hunters and \\\\nrenters. It will also compel more buyers and renters to stay in \\\\ntheir much older, less-efficient homes.\\\\n    More concerningly, the Federal Housing Finance Agency is \\\\nconsidering applying similar standards to those adopted by HUD \\\\nand USDA for homes financed by Fannie and Freddie, which \\\\nprovides 72 percent of the financing for new home purchases. \\\\nThis would set a de facto national energy code severely \\\\ndisrupting new home construction, increasing the housing supply \\\\nshortage and negatively impacting affordability. The adoption \\\\nof this 2021 energy code can add $31,000 to every new home. In \\\\nmy home State of Idaho, every $1,000 that you raise the price \\\\nof a house, 800 households are priced out of the market. All \\\\nregulations should be designed with small business and their \\\\nconsumers in mind, and should consider the true real-world cost \\\\nof these regulations.\\\\n    Labor barriers are also contributing to the housing \\\\naffordability crisis through higher home-building costs, and \\\\nconstruction delays. In the construction industry a shortage of \\\\nskilled labor means that we can expect almost 400,000 open jobs \\\\nin any given month. And NAHB research suggests that we will \\\\nneed 2.2 million workers in the next 3 years to meet existing \\\\nhome-building demand.\\\\n    This places upward cost pressures on existing home prices \\\\nand rents and pushes the dream of homeownership out of reach \\\\nfor potential homeowners. Policymakers at all levels of \\\\ngovernment can help by supporting full funding for building and \\\\nconstruction trades education including the DOL&#x27;s Job Corps \\\\nprogram.\\\\n    Since the pandemic, the cost of materials has surged 38 \\\\npercent. Building materials, supply-chain barriers, are harming \\\\nhousing affordability as the cost of lumber, steel, aluminum \\\\nand other imported materials and equipment increased price \\\\nvolatility and drive up housing costs. Of particular concern, \\\\ncurrently, is the price of the availability of distribution \\\\ntransformers. Since February of to 2020 the price of \\\\ndistribution transformers is up 72 percent and NAHB&#x27;s members \\\\nreport that wait times for transformers range from 12 to 36 \\\\nmonths.\\\\n    One of my recent condo projects was facing a potential \\\\ndelay of 18 months because we couldn&#x27;t get the right \\\\ntransformer. We were forced to modify the product at a cost of \\\\nan additional $60,000 on just six condos. These added costs are \\\\npricing local Idahoans out of the dream of homeownership.\\\\n    Congress must help ease supply chain barriers by investing \\\\nin the domestic production of sorely needed distribution \\\\ntransformers. The current economic landscape for the home \\\\nbuilding industry is challenging without question. It is a \\\\ngenerational policy challenge that we can solve. We must solve \\\\nit. And it begins with continually removing barriers to \\\\nincrease housing production.\\\\n    Thank you again for this opportunity. And I look forward to \\\\nyour questions.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.\\\\n    I now recognize Mr. Ewing for his 5-minute opening remarks.\\\\n\\\\n                STATEMENT OF JAMES D. EWING, JR.\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. EWING. Thank you, Chairman Williams, Ranking Member \\\\nChu, and Members of the Committee, good morning. Thank you for \\\\nthe opportunity to testify at today&#x27;s hearing on state of the \\\\nsmall business economy. My name is J.D. Ewing, Chairman and CEO \\\\nof COE distributing, a national office furnishings, wholesale \\\\ndistributor and contract manufacturer based in Fayette County, \\\\nPennsylvania. COE Distributing is a family-owned business, it \\\\nhas operated since 1947 when my grandmother started the \\\\nbusiness in a basement of a tavern out of the necessity to \\\\nsupport her two sons. I am the third-generation owner of COE \\\\nDistributing after taking over the business at age 19 in 1989. \\\\nAt that time, I was COE&#x27;s only employee.\\\\n    Through an enormous amount of hard work and dedication from \\\\na number of dedicated and talented team members, COE has grown \\\\nto over 120 employees with distributions centers in Charlotte, \\\\nNorth Carolina; Houston, Texas; and southwest Pennsylvania; \\\\nwhere our corporate headquarters are located.\\\\n    At COE, we have cultivated and continuously strived to grow \\\\na robust culture, which is fundamental in the success of our \\\\nand any small business. We take immense pride in fostering an \\\\ninclusive environment or input from all team members at every \\\\nlevel of the organization. It is not only encouraged, but \\\\nactively sought. We are also proud to provide our team members \\\\nwith extensive benefits and career development programs, \\\\nincluding health and retirement benefits, formal profit \\\\nsharing, 401(k) plans, quarterly cash bonuses and personal \\\\nbenefits, such as financial workshops and volunteer paid time \\\\noff.\\\\n    In addition, we are the official engagement partner of the \\\\nPittsburgh Penguins, and hold monthly peer-to-peer recognition \\\\nprogram awarding a game worn Penguins helmet to the employee \\\\nwho embodies COE&#x27;s core values of customer service, respect, \\\\nteamwork, quality, safety, innovation and transparency. This \\\\nand other employee engagement focus efforts allow our unique \\\\nworkplace culture to grow stronger every day.\\\\n    Today, we see many challenges in the economy, including \\\\nrising costs and supply chain disruptions, looming tax \\\\nincreases on small businesses and compliance costs with new \\\\nregulations. Although the country has recovered from the \\\\npandemic, many of these same supply chain challenges we face \\\\nthen are beginning to reemerge today. Major ports are again \\\\nbeginning to see severe backlogs due to congestion and delays. \\\\nThe disruption in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal due to \\\\nterrorist activity has had a material impact on shipping costs \\\\ndelivery time, adding up to 4 weeks to some shipping lanes. \\\\nThis disruption has led to substantial increase in the cost of \\\\nshipping containers, with the average cost of the shipping \\\\ncontainer increasing over three times in the past 90 days \\\\nalone.\\\\n    In April, a container from Asia to the U.S. was \\\\napproximately $2,500. By July, now the cost is over $8,000 and \\\\nexpected to rise to over $10,000 in the coming months because \\\\nof the peak season that we are now entering. Many home \\\\nfurnishing retailers have already implemented ocean freight \\\\nrelated surcharges to their goods reminiscent of the COVID \\\\nsupply chain consequences.\\\\n    While small businesses like mine are already seeing the \\\\nimpact of the supply chain disruption, it will soon impact the \\\\nentire economy as it did 2 years ago. In addition to rising \\\\ncosts, small businesses are also seeing their near-term \\\\nchallenge of potential tax increases. The 2017 tax reform \\\\nreduced taxes for small businesses through the reduction in tax \\\\nrates and the creation of the 199A small business deduction.\\\\n    This tax cut helped us reinvest in our workers by giving us \\\\nmore resources to hire, raising wages and provide benefits and \\\\ntraining as well as devoting more resources toward expanded the \\\\nbusiness and contributing to our local communities. Not only \\\\ndoes this looming expiration of these tax reforms threaten our \\\\nability to continue reinvesting the workers in the communities, \\\\nbut it also makes it more challenging to compete with large \\\\nbusinesses, especially in attracting and retaining talent given \\\\ntoday&#x27;s job market.\\\\n    A longer-term tax challenge for family-owned businesses \\\\nlike mine is planning for the death tax, which makes businesses \\\\nvulnerable by acquisition by large corporation or foreign \\\\nentities and often forces family-owned businesses to liquidate \\\\na portion of the business or the entire business to pay this \\\\ndeath tax.\\\\n    Small businesses are also disproportionately hit by \\\\nregulatory requirements. As a small-business owner, the time \\\\nand cost to keep current on these issues is overly burdensome \\\\nfrom the time and resource standpoint. While regulations are \\\\ninevitably a cost of doing business, we must ensure together \\\\nthat all businesses are not unduly impacted by red tape and \\\\ndisproportionate cost.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, Small \\\\nBusiness Committee. I hope my insights on the economy are \\\\nhelpful and I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I now recognize Mr. McCarthy for his 5-minute opening \\\\nremarks.\\\\n\\\\n                   STATEMENT OF TOM MCCARTHY\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. Good morning, Chairman Williams, Ranking \\\\nMember Chu, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank \\\\nyou for the opportunity to testify in this hearing about the \\\\ncurrent economic landscape in America.\\\\n    I appreciate the opportunities that allow a small business \\\\nlike mine to participate in a setting like this in our Nation&#x27;s \\\\nCapital. Special thank you to Congresswoman Judy Chu who has \\\\nworked tirelessly to support us and thousands of small \\\\nbusinesses achieve success and thrive in today&#x27;s economy.\\\\n    My name is Tom McCarthy, I am a cofounder and the vice \\\\npresident of business development for Motiv Space Systems \\\\nlocated in Pasadena, California. We support the civil national \\\\nsecurity and commercial space sectors by enabling \\\\nmaneuverability in complex environments primarily in space.\\\\n    Over the past 10 years, our company has grown from a team \\\\nof three people to almost 80 employees just last year. In \\\\npreparation for this hearing, I looked at our subcontractor \\\\nlist and the results were pretty remarkable. Throughout our \\\\nhistory, Motiv has utilized almost 800 suppliers across 42 \\\\nStates and four countries. Small businesses have a larger \\\\neconomic impact than most people realize. We started the \\\\ncompany because we believed that we could develop and build \\\\nspace-based robotic systems more efficiently, with a higher \\\\nlevel of quality and capability than our competitors in a \\\\nglobally competitive aerospace market.\\\\n    And we were right, we successfully won and have executed \\\\nmultiple NASA contracts for a range of missions including a \\\\nrobotic arm and science camera systems on the Mars 2020 \\\\nPerseverance Rover. From our beginning, innovation has been \\\\ncrucial for thriving in the highly competitive aerospace \\\\nenvironment. Our company&#x27;s long-term health relies on \\\\nconsistently incorporating new technology for our mission \\\\npartners, this means continuously expanding our research and \\\\ndevelopment.\\\\n    I would like to discuss a few topics related to small \\\\nbusiness in the United States, and our relationships with \\\\nvarious government partners today. With regard to the small \\\\nbusiness innovative research programs we have developed a chart \\\\nthat shows how SBIR contracts have been fundamental to \\\\ninnovating our technology. I think that may be how we got \\\\ninvited today. But the key here is we don&#x27;t live off the \\\\nrevenue of SBIR contracts. We convert those SBIR investments \\\\ninto seeds to grow new commercial products and close technology \\\\ngaps for our partners to enable new and exciting scientific \\\\nmissions continuing the pulse of scientific discovery.\\\\n    We have won a total of 18 Phase I and Phase II SBIR awards, \\\\nand leverage those awards into eight commercialized program \\\\nawards. And then historically, that has amounted to about 25 \\\\npercent of our revenue over the course of business.\\\\n    As you look at the SBIR reauthorization next year, I would \\\\nencourage you to absolutely keep this vital program alive. Talk \\\\nwith the small businesses in your community who leverage these \\\\nprograms, and then engage with those who are not aware of them.\\\\n    With regard to consistent predictable budgets, many of our \\\\ncustomers are dependent on federal budgets and the effects of \\\\nbudget delays to those customers amplified within the small \\\\nbusiness community. Over the last decade, I believe every \\\\nsingle fiscal year started off under a continuing resolution. \\\\nCRs only delay programs and forces our partners to make \\\\npremature decisions, much like we saw with the Mars Sample \\\\nReturn Campaign. The aerospace industry has faced worsening \\\\nsupply chain disruptions and rising prices due to recent \\\\nevents. And on top of that, the cost and lead time for raw \\\\nmaterials have doubled, and our suppliers have had to \\\\nsignificantly increase their prices and that ripples through or \\\\ncommunity as well.\\\\n    With regard to the research and development tax credit, I \\\\nwould also like to raise the importance of the R&amp;D tax credit \\\\nthat has expired. It is extremely important for a small \\\\nbusiness like mine that operates on tight budgets. I have heard \\\\nthe discussions in press related to Fortune 500 companies but \\\\nrarely from the small business perspective. Let me be clear: \\\\nThe R&amp;D tax credit allowed us to reinvest into further R&amp;D and \\\\nother business operations to encourage innovation, and allows \\\\nyou to tackle more ambitious projects. Investing in R&amp;D allows \\\\nsmall technology businesses to develop new products and improve \\\\nexisting ones, helping us stay competitive in the global \\\\nmarket.\\\\n    In conclusion, small businesses are leading contributors to \\\\nthe economic success of this country. We cannot take this \\\\nlightly and must consider all the tools in the toolbox when it \\\\ncomes to incentivizing the backbone of this great nation which \\\\nare our small businesses.\\\\n    Again, thank you for inviting Motiv to participate in this \\\\nhearing, and to discuss how our small businesses is literally \\\\nallowing our nation to do things out of this world while \\\\nbringing jobs and economic prosperity to our hometown. I look \\\\nforward to today&#x27;s dialog and answering any questions you may \\\\nhave. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back. And those are \\\\ngreat testimonies. We will get started now and I recognize \\\\nmyself for 5 minutes.\\\\n    This Committee has routinely heard from small business \\\\nowners that Bidenomics has not been working for Main Street \\\\nAmerica. As we have seen the cost of capital increase in this \\\\nhigh interest rate environment, small businesses have become \\\\nincreasingly reliant on credit cards which carry high interest \\\\nrates, and traditional bank loans to finance their operations.\\\\n    I am very concerned that we are approaching a cliff with \\\\nthis mounting credit card debt piling up, but that is a \\\\nconversation for another day. However, it is not just interest \\\\nrates that are increasing the cost of borrowing, regulations \\\\nadd significant costs to financial institutions, which are \\\\nultimately passed along to their customers.\\\\n    Ms. Davis, first question, you previously served as \\\\ncompliance officer to your bank and are very aware of the \\\\nimpact that regulations have on the price of various financial \\\\nproducts. So can you tell us how increased compliance burdens \\\\nare negatively affecting the access to capital in your \\\\ncommunity? And which customers are most impacted by this \\\\nincreased cost?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Thank you, Chair. Yes, related to compliance \\\\ncosts, as I said in my statement, every dollar spent takes away \\\\nfrom an investment in the community either through a loan, or \\\\nthrough direct capital program investments to improve those LMI \\\\nindividuals lives specifically related to the increase in \\\\ncosts. It overhead costs the same amount to originate a $5,000 \\\\nloan versus a $100,000 loan, but the cost ratio of what has had \\\\nto be implemented is less proportional to the smaller-dollar \\\\nloans. So it tends to affect our low- and moderate-income \\\\nborrowers the most, because they are those that are looking for \\\\nthe smaller-dollar business loans.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The recent report projected that the \\\\nhousing industry will need an additional 500,000 workers \\\\nannually to meet the demands of the market. This is an \\\\nunfortunate reality for many industries across the country. \\\\nWhen I served as Secretary of State of Texas, I was charged \\\\nwith overseeing the infrastructure projects in the State. And \\\\neventually we had to delay a bunch of these projects we had \\\\nplanned because we couldn&#x27;t find enough qualified welders to do \\\\nthe work.\\\\n    With this large infrastructure project to brand new homes, \\\\ndelays in work have drained local economy. So Mr. Martinez, how \\\\nhas a lack of skilled workers impacted your business?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Absolutely, thank you, Mr. Chair. We \\\\ncontinue--Idaho is a small State, and so, we compete with labor \\\\nfrom States like California, Washington and Oregon. We aren&#x27;t \\\\nable to find the labor that we need to complete our projects. \\\\nAnd when we do, I feel like we are overpaying for the quality \\\\nof work that we are getting. We do high-end residential and so \\\\nin order to find the qualified worker that we need to do the \\\\nproject that we are talking about, we either have delays in \\\\ntime, we have delays in quality, we have a delay in trying to \\\\nget somebody at a market rate that we feel is appropriate. And \\\\nwe continue to work with our--the Job Corps, we continue to \\\\nwork the Pell grants, we are working with the high schools. We \\\\nare trying to find a way to funnel kids into our industry in a \\\\nway that provides an incredible opportunity for them. It is a \\\\nshorter route.\\\\n    In Idaho, our Governor worked on lowering the requirements \\\\nto get a journeyman&#x27;s license because we can&#x27;t--we just don&#x27;t \\\\nhave enough bodies and the barriers to entry are so high that \\\\nwe are continually working on making it easier, fast-tracking, \\\\ntrying to get these kids in our industry.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. That is good.\\\\n    Mr. Ewing, the story of your family-owned business really \\\\nhits home for me. I have been in the car business for over 52 \\\\nyears, still am. And I took my father&#x27;s business over, now my \\\\ndaughters are third generation, and they are currently running \\\\nits operations back in Texas. It is real rewarding--as it is--\\\\nas rewarding as it has been to keep this business in the \\\\nfamily, it comes with many unique challenges. So my question is \\\\nto you, can you talk about some of the issues that your \\\\nbusinesses faced, much like mine, as it has transitioned from \\\\ngeneration to generation?\\\\n    Mr. EWING. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Our business, thankfully, \\\\ndid not have a transition challenge. I have been running it for \\\\n35 years. My dad&#x27;s still around, but he&#x27;s not involved in the \\\\nbusiness. The challenge that we have in the business today, I \\\\ntouched on the rising costs, particularly in the supply chain, \\\\nand you get a 3- to 4x increase in the cost of moving product \\\\nthat you need for inventory or product that you need to build \\\\nhouses; that is a very difficult situation to react to and pass \\\\nthe costs along, particularly as a small business.\\\\n    That is the biggest challenge that we have today in my \\\\nopinion, reining in costs and trying to understand how we can \\\\nreact to them appropriately and not overburden our customers at \\\\nthe same time.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. That is a big deal. You just can&#x27;t pass \\\\neverything on to the customer.\\\\n    Mr. EWING. No, sir.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS.--because if it rolls back on business.\\\\n    So with that in mind, I now recognize the Ranking Member \\\\nfor 5 minutes for her questions.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Mr. McCarthy, thank you for being here today to \\\\nshare your experience as a high-tech small business. I was so \\\\nimpressed when I visited your facility last year and was able \\\\nto see how remarkable Motiv&#x27;s success and growth has been over \\\\nthe past decade.\\\\n    Can you tell us more about Motiv&#x27;s story, how you came to \\\\nfind success in Pasadena and build a customer base nationwide? \\\\nAnd also, I was able to see your robotic arm, why was that so \\\\ninnovative allowed for the Mars Perseverance Rover to survive \\\\nthe harsh weather conditions on Mars.\\\\n    And also, actually can you address this issue, we talk a \\\\nlot about space, but do space programs help us here on Earth? \\\\nSpace programs have routinely returned some of the most \\\\nadvanced technology on the market to consumers. So can you talk \\\\nabout the next generation of products that will be coming from \\\\nthese small businesses to us?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. Thank you, yes. So I think in terms of \\\\nMotiv&#x27;s success, I think the primary function that has made \\\\nMotiv successful in building up and surviving and thriving over \\\\nthe last decade is really staying true to a particular common \\\\nthread. For us, it is the robotics, it is the motion control \\\\nand having the skilled expertise and constant workforce labor \\\\ndevelopment in order to deliver that to our customer. We have \\\\nto differentiate, we have to invest in ourselves constantly, we \\\\nhave to develop new technologies. We are creators and inventors \\\\nall in a small building or a couple of buildings.\\\\n    And so, that is important to us. And maintaining that \\\\nenergy, staying hungry and pushing and engaging with our \\\\ncustomer base is the value proposition. And it makes us good \\\\npartners to those groups. And so, I think that is primarily key \\\\nto our success.\\\\n    So, some of these programs that I talked about in my \\\\ntestimony or the predictable budgets for our customers and \\\\nmaking sure that those are operating on a certain cadence allow \\\\nus not to engage in disruption, allows us to keep working in \\\\nthose arenas.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. And again, why was your robotic arm for the Mars \\\\nPerseverance Rover so innovative that it allowed to you survive \\\\non Mars?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. And what is really interesting about the \\\\nthings that we worked on, we look at the landscape of what NASA \\\\nor other government agencies want to do in space, and what we \\\\ntry to do is we try to predict from a technological position. \\\\nWe try to understand and anticipate what they are going to \\\\nneed, and that is where our investments go, is to hone those \\\\nskills and then apply them and test them and validate them so \\\\nthat the reliability and quality is high and the customer is \\\\ngoing to get a good solid product that they know is going to \\\\nwork year in and year out. And fortunately we have had that \\\\nsuccess on the programs that we supported in the Mars&#x27; \\\\nactivities and that has been very rewarding for us.\\\\n    You asked another question, I think, which was related to \\\\nhow does space benefit the rest of us? Space, it is \\\\ninteresting, sometimes we feel very disconnected to what \\\\nhappens in space, but the reality is we use it every day. It is \\\\npart of our GPS activities, most of the functions on your phone \\\\nhave some origins or some biproduct that feeds into its utility \\\\nthrough a space capability. Our weather predicting comes from \\\\nspace, our early warning systems from solar activity that could \\\\ndisrupt networks, power stations, distribution centers and that \\\\nkind of thing come from space observation. So space, whether it \\\\nis pursued for science or it is pursued for economic benefit, \\\\ncommerce, utility is really valuable. And it is easy to \\\\noverlook because we are often doing things very terrestrially, \\\\nif you will, but it is a huge contributor to the success of \\\\nour----\\\\n    Ms. CHU. And let me follow up on SBIR itself because you \\\\nhave a remarkable 18 contracts with SBIR, which of course is \\\\nthe program administered by the SBA. How do SBIR grants \\\\nrepresent an opportunity for the American taxpayers and the \\\\nfederal government to see a return on their investment with \\\\nthese small businesses? And also, it was only reauthorized for \\\\n3 years in 2022. When it comes around next year, should we \\\\nconsider a long-term extension or even permanency?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. So, I will answer the back half of that \\\\nfirst, yes, please. I think long-term extension and permanency \\\\nof that program is extremely valuable. I think it is something \\\\nthat for businesses that are in the high-tech arenas and are \\\\nlooking to serve different government agencies and help them \\\\nclose technical gaps, it is extremely valuable. Sometimes gaps \\\\nexist in conceptual mission or technology development. And it \\\\nis really that distilled talent that resides within America&#x27;s \\\\nsmall business force that sometimes is able to execute those \\\\nfunctions, and that then makes future missions, future \\\\ntechnologies, future capabilities viable.\\\\n    So I think that SBIR program has shown its worth by those \\\\ninvestments turning into the things that we see on a daily \\\\nbasis.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back. I now \\\\nrecognize Representative Luetkemeyer from the great State of \\\\nMissouri for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    My questions today will be with regards to tax cuts and \\\\nregulations, you know. I think the tax cuts of 2017 showed that \\\\nleaving money in people&#x27;s pockets, leaving money in business&#x27; \\\\npockets so they can reinvest it as they see fit, whether it is \\\\nto expand your lines, to go expand your business, pay \\\\nemployees, buy more product whatever it is seems to work and \\\\ngenerated a revolution in entrepreneurship during the 16, 17, \\\\n18, 19, 20-year cycle, where suddenly it went from more \\\\nemployees than jobs to over $1 million--a million more jobs \\\\nthan employees in just a short period of time.\\\\n    So Ms. Davis, quite frankly as a former banker, you have \\\\ngot the toughest job at the became as a compliance officer. I \\\\nempathize with you. You have a tough job, especially with the \\\\nrules and regulations pouring out of Washington and the cost of \\\\ncomplying with those. My question today is with regard to the \\\\ntax cuts, you see it every day with the businesses that you \\\\nfinance in the bank. Have you seen those businesses take those \\\\ndollars and reinvest them or do you see them sticking in their \\\\npocket and running off and vacationing with those things?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Most small businesses are members of their \\\\ncommunities. So they are going to take those dollars that they \\\\nhave been able to accumulate and reinvest not only to grow \\\\ntheir businesses, but also in their employees. A lot of them \\\\nsmall businesses provide additional services, volunteer hours. \\\\nSmall businesses really are the lifeblood of all of our \\\\ncommunities. And so, when they have dollars available they can \\\\nexpand their businesses.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. You have to remember too, those are their \\\\ndollars, not the government dollars.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, the other three of you have lived the \\\\nAmerican Dream. You started from basically nothing and built \\\\nyour companies. I admire you beyond what you know. Tell me \\\\nwhenever you got the tax cuts in 2017 what did you do with \\\\nthose dollars? How did it affect your business?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Absolutely, thank you, Representative.\\\\n    Our business relies on debt. We have to procure debt in \\\\norder to do more projects. And so, we were able to--and with \\\\nthat debt comes investment that we have to make, it comes with \\\\ndollars that we have to come up with from a downpayment \\\\nperspective.\\\\n    So when we are doing lots, when we are doing a subdivision, \\\\nwhen we are doing an apartment project, we have to come up with \\\\nthat additional money. And that was more money in our pocket to \\\\ncontinue to grow the economy in our local market. It allowed \\\\nus, it fast-tracked us an opportunity to be able to do projects \\\\nthat we had on the shelf that had been moth-balled waiting on \\\\nfunds to come in. And so it absolutely projected our company \\\\nforward in those years after that.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Mr. Ewing, same question to you, how \\\\ndoes the tax cuts affect you? And I would argue that since the \\\\npandemic, it actually is underpinning the growth of our economy \\\\nby allowing businesses to keep their own money and then \\\\nreinvest as you see fit. How did the tax cut affect you and \\\\nyour business? And how are you managing those dollars today?\\\\n    Mr. EWING. Thank you for the question. You mentioned that \\\\nthe reinvestment into our team members through raising wages, \\\\nadditional training, creating a better environment for them is \\\\nreally where we focused. Our business is also built on \\\\ninventory and having product on the shelves so we were able to \\\\nexpand the amount of inventory that we had in our facilities \\\\nand our distribution centers and therefore we could react to \\\\nthe market and our clients quicker. So it was really about \\\\nreinvesting into the company mainly with the people.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. McCarthy, you talked about the \\\\nresearch and development tax credit, that is a huge deal for \\\\nsmall business especially, and especially in your situation \\\\nwhere you are doing a lot of research and development. The \\\\ncontinuation of that is going to be very, very important, you \\\\nknow, we had tax cut, this 2017 tax cut is coming up for \\\\nrenewal next year. It is a really, really big deal that we make \\\\nsure that happens. Can you talk about the impact on that?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. Yeah, absolutely. So just like my colleagues \\\\nhere said the reinvestment is critical to success. In the past \\\\nwhen those credits have been available, we have been able to \\\\nput that into our facilities, put that into capital equipment, \\\\nput that into capability. And those become again \\\\ndifferentiating tools for us going forward and allow us to grow \\\\nour company, train workforce, or, again, plan for the future.\\\\n    So we try to develop a roadmap on how to better serve our \\\\ncustomer base and that is a constant activity. And so those \\\\ngive us one more tool just like other programs to help us \\\\nexecute.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, I think you talked about the 2021 energy code \\\\nthat is very difficult to comply with. I have got a limited \\\\namount of time, can you just, very quickly, give us a little \\\\nbrief problem that you have there?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes. My concern is in my very limited time. \\\\nThe State of Idaho has done their own energy code that makes \\\\nsense for Idaho. Through the negotiated rule-making process, we \\\\nhad the opportunity to take things out that don&#x27;t make sense \\\\nand add things that do make sense. With the national \\\\nstandardization of code, we are now I feel like taking States \\\\nrights away on their ability to make changes on the energy \\\\ncode.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Thank you very much. My time has expired. \\\\nWith that, I yield.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Scholten from the great \\\\nState of Michigan for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thanks so much, Mr. Chair. And thank you to \\\\nour witnesses for coming here today and for all of your \\\\nincredibly valuable testimony. So proud of the small business \\\\nfootprint in my district, actually 99 percent of businesses in \\\\nthe State of Michigan are classified as small, if you can \\\\nbelieve that. When I speak with businesses in my district, \\\\nrising costs are the biggest concern that they have. Many of \\\\nthem say supply-chain bottlenecks concentrated market power as \\\\na primary cause.\\\\n    My first question is for Mr. McCarthy. In your testimony, \\\\nyou emphasized how important it is to ensure small businesses \\\\ncan compete with larger companies, agree. In addition to \\\\nfunding mechanisms such as R&amp;D Tax credit, are there other ways \\\\nCongress can encourage competition to keep prices low \\\\nthroughout the supply chain?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. I think one thing that we have seen that has \\\\nbeen difficult is that coming out of COVID with the supply-\\\\nchain issues we saw that buying power changed dramatically, \\\\nspeaking to our particular supply-chain semiconductor industry.\\\\n    What we started getting from the sellers of semiconductors \\\\nwas different requirements on how much you could buy, prices \\\\nwent way up, lead times got excessively long, and then in some \\\\ncases, there was no guarantee of the price that you were \\\\nactually being quoted as being the final price. I have never \\\\nseen that before in my life, my entire career where there is an \\\\nunstable price basis. And so, I think something needs to be \\\\nlooked at there. I don&#x27;t know if that is all COVID-related or \\\\njust a global economic situation, but that really hurts the \\\\nbuying power for small businesses that are trying to be \\\\ninnovative and are trying to compete against a variety of \\\\nentities.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you, that is really helpful.\\\\n    Another top concern among small business owners in west \\\\nMichigan is the need for skilled labor. Some small-business \\\\nowners tell me they have had to reduce hours and service \\\\nbecause of the labor shortages they face. Our country has had \\\\nlow unemployment for several years now, a low unemployment rate \\\\nfor several years now. Usually is a very good thing, right? But \\\\nwe know that our small businesses are looking for the workers \\\\nthat they need. This has benefited our economy in some ways. \\\\nHowever, unique circumstances brought on by the pandemic have \\\\nmeant that small businesses are now trying to grow without a \\\\nworkforce that can meet the demand that they have.\\\\n    The next question is for Mr. Martinez. Are there additional \\\\nfactors that you see that are contributing to the labor \\\\nshortages and actions that we specifically in Congress can take \\\\nto meet those needs?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes, absolutely. So as we are facing a \\\\nshortage of labor, the Job Corps funding, the $1.2 billion Job \\\\nCorps funding got cut this year. We were jumping up and down \\\\nsaying, We are trying to train our workforce and you cut Job \\\\nCorps funding. It did get reinstated fortunately and it did get \\\\nreallocated for next year, but you have to remember through Job \\\\nCorps, through Pell grants, we have to be able to fund these \\\\nprograms that are funneling kids into the trades. They are not \\\\neven just kids, people that retraining our military, those that \\\\nhave been in the correctional system. We really are trying to \\\\nretrain a group of people. I would say the last part of this is \\\\nnot everybody is made for college, and we keep pushing that \\\\nnarrative. And we are finally getting kids that are saying I \\\\ncan go for 2 years, I can work the whole time I am doing that 2 \\\\nyears, make money and come out with a trade or a skill set. But \\\\nnow, you have got to convince their parents that they are not \\\\ngoing to college. And I think that is the next hurdle that we \\\\nhave to jump. So I think we have a cultural shift that needs to \\\\nbe made at the national level.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more. I have got a \\\\ngreat bill, The Honoring Vocational Education Act, many of my \\\\ncolleagues here are cosponsors. It is a bipartisan bill, and it \\\\nactually changes the way the United States Census tracts what \\\\nconstitutes higher education. Currently, you only get to check \\\\nthat box if you completed a 4-year college degree. I know the \\\\nvocational centers around my district. I go in and I see how \\\\nthese auto mechanics are trained. That is higher education. I \\\\ncouldn&#x27;t do that work. So I completely hear you. I think more \\\\nthan, you know, funding which we absolutely need, there has to \\\\nbe a cultural shift around this in the United States. And I \\\\nthink it comes and starts by honoring, you know, all different \\\\ntypes of education as being higher education. So one very small \\\\nthing we are trying to do here, but I appreciate you bringing \\\\nthat up. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back. I now \\\\nrecognize Representative Van Duyne from the great State of \\\\nTexas for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    I continue to hear countless stories about how this \\\\nadministration has hampered the ability of small businesses to \\\\ngrow due to its reckless spending and taxing and \\\\noverregulating. Throughout President Biden&#x27;s administration, \\\\nfederal agencies have finalized, get this, 996 new regulations. \\\\nIt costs about $1.7 trillion to American businesses. Listening \\\\nto small businesses in my district, that is a cost they can&#x27;t \\\\nabsorb. It must be passed down to the consumer. And this isn&#x27;t \\\\nso these companies or these company owners can get rich, but it \\\\nis just to be able to survive in a burdensome regulatory \\\\nenvironment. Now this is part of the reason why earlier this \\\\nyear this Committee passed my bill, the Small Business \\\\nRegulatory Reduction Act. And this bill requires that the Small \\\\nBusiness Administration ensure for each fiscal year that the \\\\ncost of small businesses at the administration&#x27;s rulemaking is \\\\nnot greater than zero, which also requires the SBA to issue a \\\\nreport on any regulations issued by other federal agencies that \\\\nimpact small businesses. That is the role of the SBA, to \\\\nactually be a champion of small businesses. And I look forward \\\\nto seeing this bill move forward and to working to ensure that \\\\nCongress reins in on the power of out of control, regulatory \\\\nglutton executive branch. And I also look forward to continuing \\\\nto work with this Committee to strengthen small businesses \\\\nacross the country. I appreciate all of the witnesses being \\\\nhere this morning.\\\\n    Along with serving on this Committee, I also serve on the \\\\nWays and Means Committee which has established 10 tax teams in \\\\nApril to study key tax provisions from the 2017 Trump tax cuts \\\\nset to expire in 2025, and to identify legislative solutions \\\\nthat will protect Americans from President Biden&#x27;s multi \\\\ntrillion-dollar tax increase.\\\\n    I am going to ask--basically I will go ahead and start with \\\\nyou, Ms. Davis. Can you tell me how the uncertainty in the tax \\\\nworld impacts your planning for the future?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Uncertainty in the tax world, specifically I \\\\ncan&#x27;t answer that. From a regulatory perspective what I can \\\\ntell you is that when small businesses don&#x27;t have additional \\\\ncapital available, they are unable to support their \\\\ncommunities. Providing tax credits and relief to small \\\\nbusinesses allows them to thrive as well as our financial \\\\ninstitution as a small business.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Appreciate that.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yeah, thank you. I think as we all know on \\\\nthis Committee, business doesn&#x27;t do well with uncertainty. And \\\\nso we start to horde cash when we feel that we have got a wave \\\\nof regulation coming along.\\\\n    The State of Idaho, Governor Little enacted a bill that for \\\\nevery one piece of regulation, two had to be stricken from the \\\\nlegislature. In doing so in the year of post-COVID we had a \\\\nrecord surplus of $2 billion. Now that might not sound like a \\\\nlot of money for some States where the Police Department&#x27;s \\\\nbudget might be $2 billion, but in a State of 1.5 million \\\\npeople a $2 billion surplus is a huge number. And I think we \\\\nare seeing the effects of some States taking that anti-\\\\nregulation or deregulation stance. And Idaho has, by far, \\\\nbecome the most deregulated or unregulated State. Some may \\\\nargue that is a good thing and some argue that is a bad thing. \\\\nBut we have seen the consequence of that with a 99.2 percent \\\\nsmall business community there was explosive growth in Idaho.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Can you also, Mr. Martinez, I wanted to \\\\nexpand on this, in 2022 I hosted a program called the Texas 24 \\\\nWorks, and it brought together high school and middle school \\\\ncounselors. We took them around the district and we them there \\\\ncan be great careers that can be had where you are making six \\\\nfigures without a college degree. Can you talk about how the \\\\ncareer in the technical education, vocational training and \\\\napprenticeships can play a great role in addressing our labor \\\\nshortage?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Absolutely, thank you. We have partnered with \\\\nthe high schools as well. We brought in high schools through \\\\nthe Home Builder Institute that does receive funds from Job \\\\nCorps, it has created a curriculum to bring kids into the \\\\ntrades. We started bringing them in. We have what we call the \\\\nParade to Homes for Pets, where they are building dog houses \\\\nand they are engaging them. They are excited to work with their \\\\nhands. It has essentially replaced shop that got cut out of the \\\\nschool program so long ago. And it is incredible as we meet \\\\nwith the youth, the excitement they have, the pride of doing \\\\nsomething with their hands. So it is just getting the hook in \\\\nand engaging them. And they see the potential for the growth is \\\\ngreat so----\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. In the 20 seconds I have got left, Mr. \\\\nEwing, would you like to expand on any of the questions that I \\\\nhave asked?\\\\n    Mr. EWING. Just reinforcing the uncertainty creates a \\\\nhoarding of cash and resources, which doesn&#x27;t allow us to \\\\ninvest in our employees and the business. So that uncertainty \\\\nis a challenge.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative McGarvey from the great \\\\nState of Kentucky for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. McCarthy, we will start with you today. Talking about \\\\nthe SBIR program that is known as America&#x27;s Seed Fund, not only \\\\nis it a vital program for research and development, but it also \\\\nawards small businesses like yours with access to the federal \\\\ngovernment as a partner. The federal government must fulfill \\\\nits purpose and invest in our communities, our constituents, \\\\nand their ideas. Mr. McCarthy, your company has received both \\\\nPhase I and Phase II SBIR awards. But Phase III is especially \\\\nimportant because it encompasses two of the sort of primary \\\\nobjectives in the program, the commercialization transition of \\\\ntechnologies. Have you had any trouble transitioning from Phase \\\\nII of the program into Phase III?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. So actually we have been awarded a couple of \\\\nPhase III programs. And in my testimony, I referred to Phase I \\\\nand II, because those are the allocated funds, whereas the \\\\nphase three is the programmatic funds, the customer funding \\\\nthat utilizes that connection from the Phase I&#x27;s and II&#x27;s, the \\\\nsuccess from there, and then bridges the gap to development, \\\\nthe execution, the production of the technology into regular \\\\nuse case.\\\\n    So we have had some success there and, I think, to your \\\\npoint, it has helped us develop that relationship stronger \\\\nwithin the federal agencies in terms of those who want to \\\\nutilize that technology. So I think that has been very \\\\nsuccessful.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Is there anything else helpful that we could \\\\ndo in these types of instances, like a centralized database for \\\\nall the projects in Phase III that eligible agencies could use \\\\nto shop for their needs?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. That is an interesting idea. I think \\\\nsocializing that is a good thing.\\\\n    I usually find that there is always a reeducation, even \\\\nwith customers, making sure that everybody is communicating \\\\nabout what the benefits are of the program. People who haven&#x27;t \\\\nused it before, haven&#x27;t utilized it, even as a monitor of the \\\\nprogram, they may be somewhat unfamiliar.\\\\n    So I think any time there is more opportunity for education \\\\nand awareness, I think those are wins.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I am going to switch topics here a little bit. Going to Mr. \\\\nMartinez.\\\\n    I appreciate all your comments today. I enjoyed your \\\\nwritten testimony as well. And obviously agree that we should \\\\nall continue working to lower costs.\\\\n    I really like what you said about promoting careers in the \\\\nskilled trades to address the labor shortage. This is something \\\\nthat we have worked on in multiple Committees here.\\\\n    And I love the line in there where you say, ``America \\\\nshould have a choice in securing safe, decent, and affordable \\\\nhousing.&#x27;&#x27; And I think that that is something, affordable \\\\nhousing, I think we are ready for a Marshall Plan of affordable \\\\nhousing, not just in my community, but in this country.\\\\n    What I want to go to for a second, though, is in your \\\\nwritten testimony you said that ``increased regulations, \\\\nespecially energy building code requirements, are making it \\\\nharder and harder for home builders and multifamily developers \\\\nto build housing that is attainable and affordable for American \\\\nfamilies.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    But when I went to your website--which is amazing. The \\\\nhomes are incredible on there. If you guys haven&#x27;t checked out \\\\nthis website, it has absolutely stunningly beautiful homes.\\\\n    You have advertised an incredible commitment to \\\\nsustainability. In fact, it says on your website that, quote, \\\\n``Commitment to sustainability is woven into every aspect of \\\\nour construction process.&#x27;&#x27; Quote, ``We strive to minimize our \\\\nenvironmental impact while maximizing energy efficiency and \\\\nincorporating ecofriendly materials that set the standard for \\\\nsustainable luxury living.&#x27;&#x27; And, quote, ``We are leading the \\\\nway in sustainable luxury home construction.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    And so this is not going to--I don&#x27;t want this--this is not \\\\na ``gotcha&#x27;&#x27; question. It is really a question.\\\\n    When we have these--you complain about the regulations, but \\\\nthen obviously are building homes, I am guessing, because \\\\npeople want those. It makes having that home cheaper and more \\\\naffordable.\\\\n    How do we square that with the opposition then to the \\\\nregulations that are encouraging that efficiency for every \\\\nAmerican who does deserve and want to have a home?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. I actually really appreciate this question, \\\\nbecause I get it asked at the legislature all the time at the \\\\nState level, because nothing I build is affordable or cheap. \\\\nAnd I am always, always, always advocating on the first-time \\\\nhome buyer.\\\\n    What we don&#x27;t understand is, if we don&#x27;t have a first-time \\\\nhome buyer who is then able to sell their home and increase \\\\ntheir wealth to become a second-time home buyer and a third-\\\\ntime home buyer, eventually I lose clients.\\\\n    So, selfishly, I am trying to advocate on behalf of just \\\\ngetting people into a home initially who then will turn into \\\\ncustomers down the road.\\\\n    But I also--I was a first-time--we all were first-time home \\\\nbuyers in this room. And there is a difference of a mandate and \\\\ngiving people the choice.\\\\n    My clients can afford to choose some of those things. They \\\\nare willing to pay for those things. But if you have somebody \\\\nthat is trying to get into their home for the first time--and \\\\nit is death by a thousand cuts.\\\\n    It is not just the energy code. The energy code is a low-\\\\nhanging fruit. But it is every jurisdiction, from the local to \\\\nthe State to the national, that ends up blowing that budget out \\\\nof whack to where people can&#x27;t afford their home.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. We are out of time. I would love to ask you \\\\nmore questions about this, particularly for first-time home \\\\nbuyers. As competing Committee schedules go up here, I have a \\\\nbill up in another Committee. But I really appreciate your \\\\ntestimony.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Maloy from the great State \\\\nof Utah for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Mr. Martinez, I was going to ask you something \\\\nalong the same lines, so let&#x27;s just continue.\\\\n    You said that a de facto national energy code sets pricing \\\\nhouseholds out of the market.\\\\n    I represent Utah&#x27;s Second District, and Idaho&#x27;s Number One \\\\nbeing just north of Utah. So we have a lot of the same housing \\\\nissues and affordability issues.\\\\n    If an energy code isn&#x27;t mandated by the federal government, \\\\ndo you have faith that the State of Idaho can figure out how to \\\\nbuild homes that are right for Idahoans?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes, thank you for that.\\\\n    I think when you talk the body of codes, it is not a \\\\nfederal code. It is actually a private group that puts these \\\\ncodes. There is an energy code, the residential code, the \\\\ncommercial code, the remodel code.\\\\n    And so understanding kind of how this body puts it \\\\ntogether, as you can imagine, lots of special interests: ``You \\\\ncan only get to this level of insulation value by using my \\\\nproduct. So I am advocating special interest on my product.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Versus the State of Idaho, which is also in the same \\\\nclimate zone as Boston, Massachusetts, doesn&#x27;t quite make sense \\\\non some of the things. It is 108 degrees today in Boise. I \\\\nthink probably really similar.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. But it is a dry heat.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yeah.\\\\n    But the point is, is that we are involving the \\\\nprofessionals. So we are sitting around the table with the \\\\nbuilding officials, with the State officials, with the \\\\nbuilders, with the remodelers, and we are coming to a consensus \\\\nof what makes the most sense.\\\\n    So I absolutely believe that as a State we can regulate \\\\nourselves better, because we are looking at all of the pieces. \\\\nWe don&#x27;t have our blinders on of what gets us the max amount of \\\\nenergy efficiency. We are looking at: How do we even get people \\\\nin these homes to begin with? What are easy upgrades down the \\\\nroad? What are things we can&#x27;t upgrade down the road?\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. I agree. I admire your dedication to \\\\nsustainability. I think sustainability is a great goal. I don&#x27;t \\\\nthink the federal government needs to mandate it for home \\\\nbuilders or States to figure out how to do sustainability.\\\\n    Go ahead.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Real quick. I think the federal government&#x27;s \\\\nregard is in life safety. So I am not against building code and \\\\nthe things that progress building code for life safety. I have \\\\ngot a great relationship with the fire officials, with building \\\\nofficials. I think energy is a separate concept and an idea. \\\\nAnd I agree with you there.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Davis, you talked about self-funded entrepreneurs in \\\\nyour testimony and how making small loans and large loans cost \\\\nthe same amount but it ends up being more burdensome to the \\\\nsmall loans.\\\\n    I have good relationships with the regional banks in Utah, \\\\nand one of the things they have expressed concerns about to me \\\\nis that they don&#x27;t always recommend federal small business \\\\nprograms. They specialize in main street businesses. They are \\\\ninvesting in their communities.\\\\n    But the programs that we are in charge of that are supposed \\\\nto help small businesses have so much red tape and such an \\\\nupfront cost and barriers to entry that they don&#x27;t always \\\\nrecommend them to the same businesses that they are designed to \\\\nhelp.\\\\n    What has your experience been with that?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Thank you. That is a great point.\\\\n    To many of our customers, it is more expensive to go \\\\nthrough SBA loan programs and other federal programs because \\\\nthere is so much red tape.\\\\n    Our experience is that we are able to meet those needs \\\\nbetter, faster, cheaper. And we don&#x27;t have prepayment \\\\npenalties. You can pick up the phone and you can call someone \\\\ndirectly. You don&#x27;t have to go through specific \\\\nrepresentatives.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Yeah. Thank you. That squares with what I am \\\\nhearing from folks in Utah. And that is something that we as a \\\\nCommittee need to be aware of and be addressing that. We can \\\\ndesign programs, but if they don&#x27;t work for the people they are \\\\ndesigned for, we are wasting our time and the taxpayers&#x27; money.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, I want to come back to you for a second.\\\\n    You are talking about skilled labor and working with high \\\\nschools. And I know not everybody needs college, but over the \\\\nlast couple of generations I think college has become the way \\\\npeople get into the workforce, the way they find jobs.\\\\n    How are you finding laborers for your industry?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yeah. I think the Band-Aid to the fix is \\\\nimmigration. Immigration through the visa program. The work \\\\nvisa is definitely a Band-Aid. And I think that is one, \\\\nunfortunately, that just doesn&#x27;t get enough attention.\\\\n    Really it is identifying now this youth group that again \\\\nwouldn&#x27;t really go down the college route. In fact, I just \\\\ntalked to a guy the other day that is trying to--he has got all \\\\n8,000 of his hours to become a journeyman for HVAC and just \\\\nhasn&#x27;t finished his schooling.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. So they are putting in the time, but the \\\\nrequirement from the schooling perspective is so hard that it \\\\nis a barrier to the entry.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Yeah. I worry about main street businesses that \\\\nhave labor needs, and people are willing to do it, but they \\\\ndon&#x27;t have a mechanism for connecting with each other.\\\\n    Mr. Ewing, I had questions for you, but I am out of time. \\\\nThanks for being here.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlewoman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Thanedar from the great \\\\nState of Michigan for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. THANEDAR. Thank you, Chairman Williams. Thank you for \\\\nthis hearing. And I appreciate all of our witnesses here.\\\\n    I want to start with SBIR.\\\\n    When I started a small technology business way back in \\\\n1990, one of the things that I did was I came across the SBIR \\\\nproposals, request for proposals.\\\\n    And I was excited. There were so many opportunities, \\\\ninnovative opportunities for me. As a Ph.D. scientist, I was \\\\nexcited to see and be able to solve some of those problems.\\\\n    And so I wrote my first Phase I grant myself, but I \\\\nrealized the odds were so high back then. I don&#x27;t know what \\\\nthey are today. Back then I was told that there is a 1 in 25 \\\\nchance of me winning a Phase I SBIR grant, Phase I.\\\\n    Is that true today, or is it better, worse?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. It is definitely competitive. I think that \\\\nwhat we see in our area is maybe it is closer to 20; 20 percent \\\\nchance of success is pretty typical.\\\\n    But I think it goes to the competitiveness and in the value \\\\nproposition and so forth and answering the call, understanding \\\\nthe fit of your technologies or the science you are trying to \\\\nsecure and understand research.\\\\n    So I think it would be great if that program could be \\\\nexpanded, that would be amazing, so we could offer more \\\\nopportunity, because I am sure there are plenty of excellent \\\\nproposals that are submitted but aren&#x27;t funded just due to the \\\\nlimitation of what the pool is.\\\\n    Mr. THANEDAR. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. But it definitely is competitive.\\\\n    Mr. THANEDAR. Let me stop you there.\\\\n    So what I noticed again was the competitiveness of it. And \\\\nso in 3 years we will be--in 2025 we will have to reconsider in \\\\nterms of renewing this.\\\\n    And I see no downside to not only renewing this program, \\\\nbut making it permanent, because it is the small businesses \\\\nthat are responsible for most of the innovation in technology. \\\\nAnd these innovations are something that is needed.\\\\n    And I was later on able to get other similar grants. And \\\\nwhile I was still running my technology business, I got my last \\\\npatent on electric batteries in 2016.\\\\n    And after that I said I want to go help others, other small \\\\nbusinesses, because the small businesses in Michigan--Michigan \\\\nis one of the most innovative States in the country.\\\\n    And our small businesses are--one, they do not know about \\\\nmany of the SBA programs, including don&#x27;t know much about the \\\\nSBIR. It is really a best kept secret. It is not marketed. It \\\\nis not talked about. So many innovative companies do not know \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Secondly, there are not enough grants available.\\\\n    And thirdly, there seems to be a huge shortage of highly \\\\nskilled engineers, scientists that small businesses could hire.\\\\n    And I would like any of you to comment on this.\\\\n    But this is stifling innovation in America. This is hurting \\\\nAmerica&#x27;s ability to stay on the forefront of innovation and \\\\ndiscoveries.\\\\n    And what can small business do in terms of promoting \\\\ninnovation, helping, getting this skilled workforce?\\\\n    Often we have skilled workforce Ph.D.s, engineers who are \\\\nhighly skilled in American universities, who can&#x27;t just get a \\\\nwork visa to stay in this country and continue to help American \\\\nbusinesses, to help our innovation.\\\\n    I want to just kind of get some idea on, some of you, on \\\\nwhat we could do to improve America&#x27;s position in innovation.\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. Well, just quickly.\\\\n    I think for us from a small business perspective, I mean we \\\\nhave to make ourselves attractive to that workforce as well.\\\\n    So it is a really a two-way street. We have to develop \\\\nourselves, invest in ourselves in order to make that happen. \\\\nAnd I think that is a critical element of operating to improve \\\\nthe workforce and meet those challenges head on that you \\\\nbrought out.\\\\n    Mr. THANEDAR. Thank you.\\\\n    I am out of time, so I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Stauber from the great State \\\\nof Minnesota for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Since President Biden took office, as we have heard, over \\\\n900 new regulations have been passed, costing nearly $440 \\\\nbillion and climbing. And it has added more than 236 million \\\\npaperwork hours to American small businesses.\\\\n    Over the next decade compliance with Biden&#x27;s regulations \\\\nwill cost Americans more than 1.5 trillion.\\\\n    Regulations such as these are unacceptable and often take \\\\nfunding away from growth opportunities for your businesses.\\\\n    Further, businesses should not need teams of compliance \\\\nofficers just to be able to compete in the marketplace. The \\\\ncosts alone are enough to force many of these small businesses \\\\nto close, further harming our economy. We must and can do \\\\nbetter for the small businesses in our communities.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, how big is your company&#x27;s regulatory \\\\ncompliance division?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. You are talking to it. So I would be \\\\ncompliance, I would be HR, I would be legal. We have four \\\\nemployees, period.\\\\n    And so to your point, I read a great book called, ``Buy \\\\nBack Your Time.&#x27;&#x27; And reading through that, is the highest and \\\\nbest use of my time figuring out compliance? Is the highest and \\\\nbest use of my time figuring out regulatory burdens? Or should \\\\nI be out selling homes and building communities?\\\\n    And so I love the fact that you keyed in on that because \\\\nfor a small business, we have been kind of a mom-and-pop \\\\nbusiness for 44 years. You are talking to every one of those \\\\nsilos here at this table.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. And how does the avalanche of regulations \\\\ncoming out of Washington make your job more difficult?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. I can tell you that because we are talking \\\\nenergy codes, because we are talking building codes, when we \\\\nget a new wholesale set of codes, it is a six to eight hundred \\\\npage document that we have to peruse through oftentimes in our \\\\ntruck as we are trying to figure out a code change.\\\\n    And that is just on the building code side of things. When \\\\nyou add OSHA, when you add EPA, when you add Army Corps of \\\\nEngineers, I mean, the list goes on and on.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Local planning and zoning.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yeah. Not to mention the anti-growth \\\\nsentiment that we are getting now because of the amount of \\\\ngrowth.\\\\n    And so we are fighting it on all fronts. And, \\\\nunfortunately, it is just making the problem worse.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. And so reference the 2021 International Energy \\\\nConservation Code that is coming without amendment. What impact \\\\nwill these changes have on your business, and how might they \\\\nimpact potential home buyers?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yeah, we already have a pricing problem. I \\\\nmean, we have already priced in Boise the local buyer. And I am \\\\nborn and raised--I am one of the few that is born and raised in \\\\nmy hometown. But we are pricing the local buyer out of the \\\\nmarket.\\\\n    And I think when a regulatory agency comes out and says, \\\\nwell, it is only $200 here, and it is only $300, they don&#x27;t \\\\nrealize the total impact. Going from our current energy code to \\\\nthe 2021 code will be almost $30,000 for Idahoans. And that is \\\\na number I can&#x27;t stomach.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. I mean, the median income in the district that \\\\nI represent is a little over $55,000. It is unbelievable when \\\\nthis comes down on you.\\\\n    Ms. Davis, what effect does increased regulations have on \\\\ninflation?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Well, I can speak directly to the costs that \\\\nhave to be passed to borrowers. You asked the size of the \\\\ncompliance departments. We have four full-time compliance \\\\npeople just to read the regs. We have one full-time person just \\\\nto deal with the data collection efforts on CRA and HMDA. We \\\\nwill definitely have to add to staff with 1071. We have got two \\\\nfull-time CRA individuals; more than that on the BSA side. And \\\\nthen, of course, we have to invest in systems. So all the \\\\nfrontline individuals are part of our compliance team too.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. It is just amazing the number of people you \\\\njust mentioned you have to hire to keep up with these rules and \\\\nregulations that are just crushing small businesses across \\\\nAmerica.\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Correct. It is part of our overhead, and we have \\\\nhad to pass that down in origination charges.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. Ewing, I am very happy that you are bringing your best \\\\nemployees to the Pittsburgh Penguins games. Minnesota is the \\\\nState of hockey. And when I heard you testify, I said that is \\\\nawesome. So I appreciate that.\\\\n    Listen, I am almost out of time. I want to ask every one of \\\\nyou the question: Has Bidenomics and inflation affected your \\\\nbusiness?\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, your business?\\\\n    Mr. EWING. Inflation absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. Inflation.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. So here is the issue. There is not one person \\\\nthat has come in front of this Committee that has said, ``We \\\\nwant more regulations. Please put more regulations on them.&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nEvery single Member that I have asked, witness at a hearing, \\\\n``No more. We are done. We can&#x27;t handle it.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I am a small business owner for 31 years. We sold our \\\\nbusiness. It is unbelievable, unacceptable what this \\\\nadministration is doing to you all.\\\\n    Mr. Chair, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Gluesenkamp Perez for 5 \\\\nminutes from the great State of Washington.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, I wanted to talk with you a little bit about \\\\nhousing. I appreciate your perspective on the economic \\\\nlandscape for small businesses, including contracting companies \\\\nlike your own.\\\\n    We have also talked in this Committee about how we feel the \\\\nlack of affordable housing can actually be a barrier to small \\\\nbusinesses being able to hire and retain quality employees. \\\\nSomeone isn&#x27;t going to move to a new town for a job if there is \\\\nno place to live. So this is especially a challenge in \\\\nincentivizing business development in rural communities.\\\\n    I agree with you completely that we need to boost the \\\\nhousing supply to address this issue of housing affordability. \\\\nAnd this means in some cases tackling--in many cases--tackling \\\\nburdensome local zoning regulations, shoring up the supply \\\\nchain for materials, and promoting careers in the skilled \\\\ntrades so there is ample labor.\\\\n    But I also wanted to talk about regulations. In November, \\\\nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission proposed a rule that \\\\nwould mandate finger detention technology on all consumer and \\\\ncommercial table saws, which sounds like it made for good \\\\nreading.\\\\n    But the reality is there is just one company that owns the \\\\nmonopoly on that patent technology, and effectively enforcing \\\\nthat would have been a government-mandated monopoly.\\\\n    Your organization commented on the proposed rule that the \\\\ncost of table saws has more than doubled, small manufacturers \\\\nmay be forced to exit the market, and businesses may be unable \\\\nto operate.\\\\n    I believe that if the Commission had had somebody who has \\\\nworked in construction on the body, they would know that if you \\\\nraise the cost of a table saw by $400, people are just going to \\\\nput a circ saw on a sheet of plywood, and more people are going \\\\nto end up hurt.\\\\n    So that is why I introduced a bill to help maintain access \\\\nto lower-cost table saws and prevent the proposed rule from \\\\nleading to a monopoly on table saws with that kind of \\\\ntechnology.\\\\n    So my question, Mr. Martinez. Do you believe it would be \\\\nhelpful to have people in the decisionmaking room who have \\\\nhands-on-the-ground knowledge about the potential impacts of \\\\nrulemaking like this.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes, Representative. I really appreciate that \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    One, you have got way more common sense than a lot of the \\\\njurisdictions that we work with. We get excluded out of \\\\nconversations all the time about growth, about safety, about \\\\nthe things that directly affect us.\\\\n    I was at a summit a couple weeks ago, and even the members \\\\nin that summit, they were activists, they were academics, they \\\\nhad never worked in our industry, and yet were proposing laws \\\\nand regulations and rules that I just kept scratching my head.\\\\n    I am a framer. I was telling my team the other day when we \\\\nwere talking about the table saw issue, I know ways around all \\\\nof that safety. I am worried that we are going to use a SKIL \\\\nsaw as a table saw to get around that.\\\\n    So it is very similar on the energy code side again where \\\\nyou have got one company that provides that product. They are \\\\nthe ones advocating on it. They go, advocate on behalf of that.\\\\n    So I appreciate the commonsense approach to that. We should \\\\nalways be at the table on anything housing.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Yeah. Board tables, table saws, \\\\nwhatever it is, we need to be there, you know.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Absolutely.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. I also recently visited a \\\\ntransformer distributor in my district, and we talked about \\\\ntheir concerns about the implementation of DOE&#x27;s recently \\\\nfinalized rule regarding efficiency standards for transformers.\\\\n    I know this is a particularly salient issue in your \\\\nindustry due to the significant delays and high costs for \\\\ntransformers that you have outlined in your testimony as a \\\\nbarrier in the supply chain.\\\\n    Could you elaborate on this and speak about what you think \\\\nshould be done to ease supply chain challenges for transformers \\\\nand other building materials? What other checkpoints are you \\\\nseeing?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yeah, absolutely.\\\\n    So you can&#x27;t just do--just to define transformers for a \\\\nminute, because it is not the movie--but when you do a \\\\ntransformer on a project, that is what brings power to your \\\\nproject, power to your home, power to a subdivision.\\\\n    It was a very ill-timed rule in that we already had a \\\\nshortage on a product, and then we were going to make it more \\\\nenergy efficient, which just made the supply chain side a \\\\nbigger problem.\\\\n    So we were able to defeat the efficiency standard of DOE, \\\\nbut we still have a shortage. And it is not the transformer \\\\nitself, it is the alloy and the components that go into it.\\\\n    But it continues to be a huge challenge. It is just the \\\\nchallenge of the day. Lumber was the challenge of the day 3 \\\\nyears ago. And coming from a lumber State, you have probably \\\\nheard that a lot.\\\\n    And so transformers just happen to be that, the issue of \\\\nthe day that we are really trying to solve. And there is such a \\\\ncost impact to getting them. And kind of to your point, I don&#x27;t \\\\neven know what I am going to pay for them. I will put money \\\\ndown, just get it here, I need it, I can&#x27;t do my project \\\\nwithout it.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Yeah, and we are not going to \\\\nelectrify without them either.\\\\n    Thank you very much. Thank you all for your testimony.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Molinaro from New York for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that.\\\\n    I appreciate you all being here.\\\\n    And I do appreciate my colleague&#x27;s common sense. In fact, \\\\nwe often, even this week, get ridiculed for having to draft \\\\nlegislation to preserve the rights of American citizens to buy \\\\ntheir own home appliances as if that isn&#x27;t the most significant \\\\nissue facing Americans.\\\\n    And here we are faced with bureaucrats establishing rules \\\\nand regulations that make it difficult to purchase a table saw \\\\nor a dishwasher or a refrigerator.\\\\n    And it is often those faceless bureaucrats that establish \\\\npolicy that, frankly, make it so damn expensive for all of you. \\\\nAnd then, of course, those costs either get passed down to your \\\\ncustomers, our constituents, or you fold up your tent and stop \\\\nworking. And that to me is the great crisis that is facing main \\\\nstreet.\\\\n    Mr. McCarthy, you had offered earlier that it was good to \\\\nhave small businesses at the table and the voice of small \\\\nbusinesses being heard in tax policy, what have you. I do want \\\\nto credit this Committee in a bipartisan way under the \\\\nChairman&#x27;s leadership. We give voice to small businesses every \\\\nweek.\\\\n    The problem is that small businesses often might make it to \\\\na White House roundtable, but they are not the ones at the \\\\ntable, as Mr. Martinez has offered, and you all have kind of \\\\nreferenced in your testimony, they are not the ones at the \\\\ntable when it comes to policymaking.\\\\n    Yesterday, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee \\\\nheld a hearing on new emission standards in California that \\\\nCalifornia acknowledges would have an $86 billion disruption to \\\\nsupply chain and then went on to suggest that that would have \\\\nnominal impact to American customers, whether they are buying \\\\nfood products or construction material.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, I wanted to return to you and give you an \\\\nopportunity to kind of expand on some of the regulatory \\\\nburdens.\\\\n    You summed it up pretty well. You are all of the silos in \\\\nyour business. We know that in small businesses that is the \\\\ncase. For you it is a burden.\\\\n    At times, it would be great if Washington or the federal \\\\ngovernment didn&#x27;t have so many silos. In fact, it would be nice \\\\nif one entity knew more about other challenges so we wouldn&#x27;t \\\\nhave this regulatory regime that creates such a crisis.\\\\n    The Biden administration consistently has ignored the voice \\\\nof small businesses. We can pretend that sounds partisan, but \\\\nit is not. Consistently, small businesses have been burdened \\\\nwith regulation because the left hand not only doesn&#x27;t know \\\\nwhat the right hand is doing, sometimes the left hand doesn&#x27;t \\\\neven know there is a right hand. And so what the EPA says might \\\\ncontradict with the Department of Labor, might contradict with \\\\nsome local zoning practice.\\\\n    This administration finalized in 2023 alone more than $451 \\\\nbillion in final rules--imagine that--$451 billion in new costs \\\\nbecause of regulations established in 2023 requiring 286 \\\\nmillion paperwork hours. I can&#x27;t even fathom calculating that.\\\\n    I introduced the POST IT Act. Why? Because it would force \\\\nthe federal government to simplify regulations and require \\\\naccess transparency, small businesses having access to those \\\\nregulations.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, in a real world sense just talk a little bit \\\\nabout how providing greater transparency might at the very \\\\nleast provide some benefit to your business, but also perhaps \\\\nhold the federal government a bit more accountable.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, Representative.\\\\n    Really knowing the basis for a rule, knowing why we are \\\\ndoing this, like what is the end goal in this rule. Is it to \\\\nsave money? Is it to save lives? Tell us what it is.\\\\n    You had the EPA that had a waters of the U.S. standard. It \\\\nwas being challenged in the Supreme Court. And yet they still \\\\nmoved forward, the EPA kept moving forward with their rule, \\\\nknowing that they stood on very--and it was an Idaho case. Of \\\\ncourse, I was a little sensitive to it.\\\\n    But that Sackett case reversed the waters of the U.S. rule, \\\\nand yet the EPA kept moving forward. And we as a small business \\\\nwho deal with the EPA and Army Corps, one or the other, kept \\\\nsaying this standard stopped, like let&#x27;s wait till the Supreme \\\\nCourt rules, because we are going to just go right back and \\\\nstart all over again.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. I am glad you brought that up, because \\\\nactually there are Members like me from New York. I have spent \\\\nmy entire life trying to preserve watersheds, wetlands in the \\\\nHudson River Estuary. And the fact that that particular \\\\ndetermination by EPA, by rolling it back, some of my colleagues \\\\non the other side of the aisle suggest that somehow we are not \\\\ninterested in protecting water.\\\\n    That couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. We have \\\\nenvironmental standards, federal and state environmental \\\\nstandards that provided those protections. The EPA overstepped.\\\\n    I am going to run out of time because of my own fault. But, \\\\nMs. Davis, I recall some years ago in the 1980s when my parents \\\\nwere thrilled that they finally got a mortgage at under 11 \\\\npercent.\\\\n    Can you talk about what the highest rate of inflation in \\\\nthe last 40 years has meant to lenders?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Well, for starters, the rates have been up. When \\\\nI was in banking school, the Capstone Project provided this \\\\nscenario that could never possibly happen to ensure that \\\\nbankers were prepared. And, yet, we have see it rapidly \\\\nincreasing rates. And it surpassed even that.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you, Ms. Davis. I apologize. That was \\\\nmy fault.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Bean from the great State of \\\\nFlorida for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. A very good \\\\nmorning to you.\\\\n    Good morning, Small Business Committee.\\\\n    And to our all-star panel, welcome to your Nation&#x27;s \\\\nCapital, and thank you for your testimony. You will always \\\\nremember this day, the day you testified before Congress.\\\\n    There is no hiding it anymore: Bidenomics is not working \\\\nfor America, for main street. And your testimony today really \\\\nis in sync with the business owners of northeast Florida, in \\\\nClay County, in Jacksonville, that are just struggling with \\\\ncurveball and fastball and just an environment that makes it \\\\nextremely difficult.\\\\n    In a perfect world, it is extremely difficult to run a \\\\nsmall business. But when government is just throwing things in \\\\nyour way left and right, I know it is a struggle.\\\\n    We have had dozens of people sit in the same chairs that \\\\nyou are sitting in right now. All--many--have testified that \\\\nthey have never--they have been in business a long time. They \\\\nhave never seen the regulatory environment, the new regulations \\\\ncome down more than right now.\\\\n    Ms. Davis, would you agree with that? This is the most \\\\nregulated environment we have ever seen? It is breaking the \\\\nbacks of small business? Would you agree with that statement?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. I would agree with that.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Very good.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, jump in. Tell us.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Yes. And I lived through a once-in-a-lifetime \\\\nfinancial meltdown of 2008 to 2012 that I thought, okay, now I \\\\nam good, I am back to being in business. And I do feel like we \\\\nare in an environment now that is harder than it was in that \\\\nfinancial meltdown.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. I am going to put you down a yes, because you \\\\nagree with that, for sure.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. A long way around it.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. No, no, I am with you.\\\\n    Mr. Ewing, welcome. Glad to have you here.\\\\n    What say you? Is it the most regulated? Is the federal \\\\ngovernment just throwing things at you left and right that you \\\\nhave never seen before?\\\\n    Mr. EWING. For our business, I can&#x27;t speak to that \\\\ndirectly. But any time the federal government or any government \\\\nadds cost of doing business to the business, it takes away from \\\\nthe employees and our ability to treat them better.\\\\n    And that trickles down. And I think that is one of the \\\\neffects that aren&#x27;t recognized on regulatory burdens. \\\\nAdditional costs of running a business is--it is going to \\\\naffect a business, but it is also going to affect the tens, \\\\ndozens, hundreds of employees of those businesses which impact \\\\nmain street even further.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. It sounds like a yes to me. So thank you very \\\\nmuch.\\\\n    Mr. McCarthy, I haven&#x27;t forgot about you. What say you? \\\\nTrying to get to Mars, but it is hard to do so when the federal \\\\ngovernment throws all these monkey wrenches in the spaceship. \\\\nWhat say you? Is it being overregulated right now?\\\\n    Mr. EWING. I think there are a couple of things that have \\\\nimpacted us. I mean, as we mentioned before, inflation has. \\\\nDefinitely, we feel that. We feel that. That is our buying \\\\npower.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. But you don&#x27;t have to--do you have to have a \\\\ncircular saw or a stove to get to Mars?\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. No. No. I don&#x27;t--correct. I don&#x27;t have the \\\\nsame situation there.\\\\n    But I will say something that is important that is coming \\\\non that does affect us, is there are standards associated with \\\\nNIST and security and so forth.\\\\n    And those are things that for small businesses to start up \\\\nwith those compliances and so forth, that is something that is \\\\na new activity, a new burden for us. But I am not saying that \\\\nit is not important.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. No. I got you.\\\\n    Mr. EWING. But those are--those are things--those are----\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. So it is a challenging environment, and I will \\\\ntake that as a very strong maybe from you.\\\\n    Mr. MCCARTHY. A very strong maybe.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Ms. Davis, I was a banker too. You have the \\\\nheartbeat of main street, and hopefully every small business. \\\\nGet to know your banker or a banker that can help you navigate \\\\nthe tough environment.\\\\n    What are you seeing? What are you seeing right now at the \\\\nbank? What are your customers doing to try to keep up with \\\\nregulations and a rising interest rate?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Well, I think many of them are trying to cut \\\\ncosts. They are trying to figure out ways to continue to move \\\\nforward.\\\\n    Again, we have demand for credit, but that liquidity is \\\\nsuch a big deal.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. It is. It is tough.\\\\n    Mr. Martinez, what would you say if you could talk directly \\\\nto the Chairman of the K-12 Subcommittee on Education on how do \\\\nwe pivot to a more society focused on teaching kids a skill? \\\\nWhat would you say to that Chairman? How do we do it? What \\\\nshould you advise Congress? How do we have a new conversation?\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. I say reengage the industry. You walked away \\\\nfrom the industry a while ago. It is time to come back. And \\\\ndoing that, there are plenty of programs, there are plenty of \\\\nfunds now. Like, there is no reason they can&#x27;t be doing this.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Very good. You just told the Chairman. I am the \\\\nChairman of that Committee.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. Oh.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. We have had multiple Subcommittee--you did a \\\\ngreat job by the way.\\\\n    Mr. MARTINEZ. You are supposed to let me know.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. You did a great job. That is a little curveball \\\\nhere we can throw you to. But listen, thank you. You did a \\\\ngreat job.\\\\n    And we are having that conversation. We welcome input, and \\\\nwe are going to have to do it together. And I think it is \\\\nchanging. I think kids are realizing, ``I can make more money \\\\nwithout going into this debt&#x27;&#x27;--which is a whole nother topic \\\\naltogether.\\\\n    Look at me, ran out of time. But I am grateful for each of \\\\nyour coming. Thanks for your testimony today.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    And I now recognize Representative Meuser from the great \\\\nState of Pennsylvania for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you to all of you. My apologies for being late. I had \\\\nan earlier Committee. And as my colleague just said, good luck \\\\nfollowing that.\\\\n    Thank you, Representative Bean.\\\\n    So I am a small business person as well for well over 20 \\\\nyears, helped grow a small business into what eventually became \\\\na large business. What is being faced today is really \\\\nburdensome, to say the least, to put it in the nicest way \\\\npossible. And, boy, oh, boy, we hope to correct that come next \\\\nyear.\\\\n    But from energy, we in northeast Pennsylvania call it gas \\\\nbackwards energy policy, taxes, regulations, crime, interest \\\\nrates, inflation. The regulations that seem endless. I start \\\\nlisting them here. It is a long list, from the beneficial \\\\nownership rule to 1071 coming out of the CFPB.\\\\n    So I will start with you, Mr. Ewing. And you are from \\\\nFayette County?\\\\n    Mr. EWING. Correct.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Great. Well, that is a beautiful spot in the \\\\nworld.\\\\n    Mr. EWING. That it is.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I will be heading that way at the end of the \\\\nweek. But anyway--or in our great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\\\\n    So you mentioned--well, first off, the sunsetting of the \\\\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act, R&amp;D tax credits, potentially the 199(A) \\\\nsmall business deduction, which has been stated by President \\\\nBiden, doing away with that, all the tax relief that occurred.\\\\n    So how do you all feel about that, Mr. Ewing?\\\\n    Mr. EWING. Well, the 199(A) is going to eliminate a lot of \\\\ninvestment that small businesses are able to make, and that is \\\\na problem. And we can&#x27;t--we talked about it earlier. Not being \\\\nable to plan to invest in your business, you start to pull \\\\nback. Innovation is squashed a bit.\\\\n    And for us, as I mentioned earlier in testimony, the \\\\ninvestment into our people is really what is going to be \\\\nchallenging if the cost of doing business rises substantially \\\\nbecause tax cuts go away.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. That is devastating. I hear from my friends who \\\\nown small businesses and my constituents, and all devastating.\\\\n    So I read your OSHA officer issue, and in my district--and \\\\nI have a conference call with them on Friday with OSHA--they \\\\nseem to have this new walk-around rule where they stopped on a \\\\nconstruction site the other day, just small putting up \\\\nSheetrock for people, and the ladder was over 15 feet high. And \\\\nthey said it wasn&#x27;t secure enough.\\\\n    So after 4 hours of interrogation and permits and getting \\\\ntheir licensing, they informed--they wrote them a warning and \\\\nstated that the fine will be anywhere from zero dollars to \\\\n$14,500. Unbelievable. Walk-around. So-called walk-around by \\\\nOSHA. So we are going to have a little conversation there.\\\\n    Tell us a little bit more about your interlude with the \\\\nOSHA officer.\\\\n    Mr. EWING. It was in our Charlotte facility. And it was--I \\\\ndon&#x27;t know that it was a walk-around, but it was an unexpected \\\\nvisit. And the officer identified what they believed to be a \\\\nproblem with stability of product on racking. All our racking \\\\nwas installed according to code. But this officer, who we found \\\\nout much later in the process--this was a 6-month ongoing \\\\nprocess--was new and very aggressive and wanted to put a name \\\\nin the local agency for themselves.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Right, mount on the wall. Right.\\\\n    Mr. EWING. Yeah.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Allow me to move on. I appreciate that.\\\\n    Ms. Davis, do you think that the CFPB&#x27;s 1071 rule will harm \\\\nor help your ability to serve your customers?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. It will absolutely harm it.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Can you elaborate?\\\\n    Ms. DAVIS. Plain and simple.\\\\n    As part of my testimony, we are able to meet the small \\\\nbusiness needs by being effective and fast and efficient. That \\\\nadded cost that we are going to have to tack on for all those \\\\ndata collection points is going to hinder the expediency of our \\\\nlending efforts.\\\\n    In addition, for every compliance officer that we have to \\\\nhire to manage those data points and the examination \\\\nramifications, that is one fewer banker that we have out in the \\\\ncommunity serving our customers&#x27; needs.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Martinez, has there been anything done over \\\\nthe last three and a half years that has been a positive \\\\ndevelopment? I know inflation, everything else. Is there any \\\\npolicy? And we are going to work on this. Believe me. That is \\\\nwhy most of us are in Congress, to be advocates for small \\\\nbusiness.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I have run out of time. But maybe we could \\\\ntalk afterwards. I appreciate it. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I would like to thank our witnesses today for your \\\\ntestimony. It has been a great hearing. I think you have seen, \\\\nunlike you see in many other hearings, we do have a lot of \\\\nbipartisan agreement on where we need to take main street. And \\\\nI want to thank you all for being here.\\\\n    Without objection, Members have five legislative days to \\\\nsubmit additional materials and written questions for the \\\\nwitnesses to the Chair, which will be forwarded to the \\\\nwitnesses. So I ask the witnesses to please respond promptly if \\\\nthat happens.\\\\n    And if there is no further business, without objection the \\\\nCommittee is adjourned. Thank you.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 11:42 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]\\\\n                           \\\\n                           A P P E N D I X\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73171/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"02/14/2024\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"MARKUP OF: BUDGET VIEWS AND ESTIMATES 2025\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73171, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"Small Business\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                     MARKUP OF: BUDGET VIEWS AND ESTIMATES \\\\n                                     2025\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n                                HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                      COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS\\\\n                             UNITED STATES\\\\n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             SECOND SESSION\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                              HEARING HELD\\\\n                              \\\\n                           FEBRUARY 14, 2024\\\\n\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]                               \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n            Small Business Committee Document Number 118-042\\\\n             Available via the GPO Website: www.govinfo.gov\\\\n             \\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                   U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE                    \\\\n54-879                  WASHINGTON : 2024                    \\\\n          \\\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------                \\\\n          \\\\n                   HOUSE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS\\\\n\\\\n                    ROGER WILLIAMS, Texas, Chairman\\\\n                      BLAINE LUETKEMEYER, Missouri\\\\n                        PETE STAUBER, Minnesota\\\\n                        DAN MEUSER, Pennsylvania\\\\n                         BETH VAN DUYNE, Texas\\\\n                         MARIA SALAZAR, Florida\\\\n                          TRACEY MANN, Kansas\\\\n                           JAKE ELLZEY, Texas\\\\n                        MARC MOLINARO, New York\\\\n                         MARK ALFORD, Missouri\\\\n                           ELI CRANE, Arizona\\\\n                          AARON BEAN, Florida\\\\n                           WESLEY HUNT, Texas\\\\n                         NICK LALOTA, New York\\\\n                          CELESTE MALOY, Utah\\\\n               NYDIA VELAZQUEZ, New York, Ranking Member\\\\n                          JARED GOLDEN, Maine\\\\n                         KWEISI MFUME, Maryland\\\\n                        DEAN PHILLIPS, Minnesota\\\\n                          GREG LANDSMAN, Ohio\\\\n                  MARIE GLUESENKAMP PEREZ, Washington\\\\n                        SHRI THANEDAR, Michigan\\\\n                       MORGAN MCGARVEY, Kentucky\\\\n                       HILLARY SCHOLTEN, Michigan\\\\n                          JUDY CHU, California\\\\n                         SHARICE DAVIDS, Kansas\\\\n                      CHRIS PAPPAS, New Hampshire\\\\n\\\\n                  Ben Johnson, Majority Staff Director\\\\n                 Melissa Jung, Minority Staff Director\\\\n                           \\\\n                           \\\\n                           C O N T E N T S\\\\n\\\\n                           OPENING STATEMENTS\\\\n\\\\n                                                                   Page\\\\nHon.

And to the Republic for which \\\\nit stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and \\\\njustice for all.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Good morning. This Committee will come \\\\ntogether in order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized \\\\nto declare a recess of the Committee at any time.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s first order of business is to consider the views \\\\nand estimates on the priorities of the Committee on Small \\\\nBusiness for fiscal year 2025. Then we will briefly adjourn to \\\\nreset the room for a full Committee hearing, which will take \\\\nplace immediately following this meeting.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for an opening statement.\\\\n    It is no secret to anyone that small businesses are the \\\\nengines of our economy, and we rely on them heavily. In my \\\\nopinion, a key component of the American dream is the ability \\\\nto start your own business, to take a risk, work hard, and be \\\\nrewarded for that hard work. It is this Committee&#x27;s job to \\\\nensure the SBA&#x27;s programs are working efficiently and \\\\neffectively to the benefit of all of our small businesses, and \\\\nto ensure there is a positive ROI, return on investment, for \\\\nthe American taxpayer.\\\\n    The budget views and estimates presented today for this \\\\nupcoming fiscal year note the SBA faces a significant number of \\\\nchallenges. We as a Committee commit to conducting oversight \\\\nover systematic failures in the SBA and to promote legislative \\\\nchange that will ensure small businesses have access to the \\\\ncapital assistance they need to succeed.\\\\n    With that, I yield to distinguished Ranking Member, Ms. \\\\nVelazquez, for 5 minutes for any remarks she may wish to make \\\\non the budget views and estimates.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this \\\\nmarkup today on the Committee&#x27;s views and estimates of the \\\\nSmall Business Administration.\\\\n    Our nation&#x27;s 33 million small businesses are the heart and \\\\nsoul of our nation. They employ 46 percent of our nation&#x27;s \\\\nworkers, creating good paying jobs in our communities. They get \\\\nmore money circulating the local economy, lifting up \\\\nneighborhoods, restaurants, and retail shops. And they increase \\\\nthe tax base, leading to community improvements, like better \\\\nschools, roads, and greenspaces. But more work needs to be \\\\ndone, and I am committed to working with Chairman Williams to \\\\nmake important budgetary decisions for the SBA programs.\\\\n    The submission of this document to the Budget Committee is \\\\nan important aspect of the Committee&#x27;s work, and I am sure my \\\\ncolleagues will agree that it would have been better to wait \\\\nuntil we pass a full and complete budget for our current fiscal \\\\nyear of 2024. It would also be incredibly helpful to wait for \\\\nthe President to submit his proposed budget for fiscal year \\\\n2025, so we can appropriately react to those requests. Having \\\\nthe agency&#x27;s up to date information and projections would \\\\nenhance our recommendations to the Budget Committee.\\\\n    While not ideal timing, I appreciate the bipartisanship to \\\\nfind agreement on improving programs and oversight at the Small \\\\nBusiness Administration. We agree with much of the majority&#x27;s \\\\nviews. For example, recommending that SBA take steps to improve \\\\nits capital access, procurement, and entrepreneurial \\\\ndevelopment programs is prudent governance. federal funding for \\\\nSBA&#x27;s entrepreneurial development programs to provide free or \\\\nlow-cost counseling and training to more than a million \\\\nentrepreneurs each year is an area we both remain committed to. \\\\nI look forward to working with the Chairman to reauthorize this \\\\nprogram.\\\\n    We also agree that SBA procurement programs maximize small \\\\nbusiness participation in the federal marketplace, which in \\\\nturn boosts competition, lower prices, and expands our nation&#x27;s \\\\nsupplier base. Robust funding is imperative if we want to \\\\nprovide this program with the personnel and resources needed to \\\\nadequately meet their intent.\\\\n    Despite much consensus, there are still areas we differ, \\\\nwhich is perfectly normal. For instance, it is a Democratic \\\\npriority to do more to provide working families and \\\\nentrepreneurs with resources like childcare, give second \\\\nchances to returning citizens who were previously incarcerated, \\\\nand provide robust oversight funding to our OIG to ensure we \\\\nare holding fraudsters accountable.\\\\n    And finally, we do not dispute that agencies need to follow \\\\nthe process to reduce regulatory burdens for small firms, but \\\\nwe oppose a blanket rejection of regulations that safeguard \\\\nhealth, safety, and environment. Instead, we must proceed with \\\\nthoughtful deliberation to tailor regulation for small \\\\nbusinesses and provide compliance assistance.\\\\n    I thank the Chairman again for holding this markup and look \\\\nforward to working together in a bipartisan way to further \\\\nfoster entrepreneurship. Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back. And are there any \\\\nother Members who wish to be recognized for a statement on the \\\\nviews and estimates on the priorities of the Committee for \\\\nfiscal year 2025?\\\\n    Seeing none, the Committee now moves to consideration of \\\\nthe views and estimates. A copy of the proposed views and \\\\nestimates has been distributed to Members in advance. Without \\\\nobjection, the views and estimates are considered read and open \\\\nfor amendment.\\\\n    Does any Member seek recognition for the purpose of \\\\noffering an amendment?\\\\n    Seeing no amendments, the question is on adopting the views \\\\nand estimates on the priorities on the Committee for fiscal \\\\nyear 2025.\\\\n    All those in favor, say aye.\\\\n    All those opposed, say no.\\\\n    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the \\\\nviews and estimates are agreed to.\\\\n    If there is no further business, this concludes today&#x27;s \\\\nmarkup. Without objection, the staff is authorized to make \\\\ntechnical and confirming changes, and Members have until \\\\nFebruary 29 to submit the additional supplemental dissenting \\\\nand minority views.\\\\n    I would like to thank everyone for participating today. \\\\nWithout objection, the Committee stands adjourned.\\\\n    Members, please stay seated. We will bring in the witnesses \\\\nfor today&#x27;s hearing, which will start momentarily.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 10:00 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]\\\\n                           \\\\n                           A P P E N D I X\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73170/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"05/11/2023\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"AMERICAN CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS: PROTECTING POLITICAL SPEECH\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73170, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"House Administration\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n                    AMERICAN CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS:\\\\n                      PROTECTING POLITICAL SPEECH\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n                                HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                           COMMITTEE ON HOUSE\\\\n                             ADMINISTRATION\\\\n\\\\n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             FIRST SESSION\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                              MAY 11, 2023\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                              PART 2 OF 2\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n      Printed for the use of the Committee on House Administration\\\\n      \\\\n      \\\\n                  [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]      \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                             www.govinfo.gov\\\\n                           www.cha.house.gov\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE\\\\n                    \\\\n56-269                     WASHINGTON : 2024   \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                   COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION\\\\n\\\\n                    BRYAN STEIL, Wisconsin, Chairman\\\\n\\\\nBARRY LOUDERMILK, Georgia            JOSEPH MORELLE, New York,\\\\nH.

The hearing on the Subcommittee on Health, \\\\nEmployment, Labor and Pensions will come to order. I note that \\\\na quorum is present. Without objection, the Chair is authorized \\\\nto call a recess at any time.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis, as you near the end of your 5-year term as \\\\nthe Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or \\\\nPBGC, the day has come for--finally come for appropriate \\\\noversight and accountability. The 31 million Americans with \\\\nprivate pension plans deserve to hear from the top government \\\\nofficial responsible for safeguarding their retirement.\\\\n    The PBGC was created to be the insurance company for \\\\nprivate pension plans. If the employer is unable to payout the \\\\nbenefits by the time a worker retires, that worker should have \\\\nconfidence that he or she will still receive their benefits \\\\nbecause of the PBGC&#x27;s protection.\\\\n    Under the law, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was \\\\ncreated to be self-sustaining, meaning that it should operate \\\\nunder Congress&#x27;s oversight, but independent of taxpayer funds. \\\\nThe pension insurance in PBGC operations is supposed to be \\\\nfunded primarily through employer premiums not covered by the \\\\nU.S. Treasury. However, this all changed under the Biden \\\\nadministration.\\\\n    The so-called American Rescue Plan Act gave a 91-billion-\\\\ndollar bailout to the failing multi-employer pension fund. The \\\\nneed for the bailout underscores the ongoing mismanagement of \\\\nfunds at the PBGC. Mr. Hartogensis, your time at PBGC has been \\\\nmarked by waste, fraud, and neglect. In disbursing funds made \\\\navailable to you by the American Rescue Plan, PBGC sent almost \\\\n127 million dollars to fund pensions for nearly 3,500 dead \\\\npeople.\\\\n    This happened under your watch, despite the Office of \\\\nInspector General&#x27;s warning to cross check these payments with \\\\nthe Social Security Administration&#x27;s death master file. Then \\\\nyou refused to claw back or collect those funds. In January and \\\\nFebruary, Chairwoman Foxx and I sent you letters detailing the \\\\nCommittee&#x27;s concerns and seeking answers from PBGC.\\\\n    Unfortunately, the responses that were received from your \\\\nagency were inadequate and failed to provide clear answers. I \\\\nhope you will take the opportunity today to be more forthcoming \\\\nand come clean about PBGC&#x27;s implementation of the American \\\\nRescue Plan and its inexcusable payments to multi-employer \\\\npension plans for dead people.\\\\n    I think we can all agree this should come as no surprise \\\\nthat dead people do not need pension checks. Additionally, the \\\\nPBGC has also looted the Treasury of over 4.6 billion dollars \\\\nby intentionally lowering interest rate data below the \\\\nstatutory limit. This willful misuse of data is another afront \\\\nto taxpayers and goes against the PBGC&#x27;s initial evaluation and \\\\ncalculation which stated that, ``PBGC does not have the \\\\nauthority to provide a different rate or bifurcate the \\\\nstatutorily mandated interest rate.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Finally, while PBGC has loosely handled taxpayer dollars by \\\\nbailing out failed multi-employer pension plans, it has given \\\\nno such relief to businesses with solvent plans. Single \\\\nemployer programs have consistently paid high insurance \\\\npremiums and consistently avoided insolvency.\\\\n    The single employer pension surplus is 44.6 billion. I \\\\nthink it is time to come to the table with policymakers and \\\\nlegislators to reward these plans for their good stewardship by \\\\nlowering premiums. For many to achieve the American dream of a \\\\ncomfortable, and secure retirement, they need to rely on \\\\npersonal savings, social security and a pension.\\\\n    Sadly, the government today poses a threat to all three. \\\\nBiden inflation is devaluing personal savings. Social Security \\\\nfaces a 23 percent benefit cut if Congress does not act to make \\\\nit solvent. The security of pension programs is at the mercy of \\\\nbureaucrats like those at PBGC.\\\\n    Retirement security is quickly eroding thanks to \\\\nbureaucrats like yourself. We must hold these retirement \\\\npromises made to the 31 million Americans with pension plans \\\\nwithout sacrificing the promises made to the other 310 million \\\\nAmericans. Today that means embracing accountability and \\\\noversight, and with that, I yield to the Ranking Member for his \\\\nopening statement.\\\\n    [The Statement of Chairman Good follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I totally \\\\nagree with oversight, but from a completely different \\\\nperspective. It may not be surprising. Thank you, Director, \\\\nthank you for your service. Thank you for being here today and \\\\nthank you for the job you have done under extremely difficult \\\\ncircumstances.\\\\n    When President Biden came into office, he inherited a \\\\nmultiemployer pension system on the brink of collapse. Many \\\\nplans were failing, and some like Central States, were \\\\nprojected to run out of money in the next few years. More than \\\\n1 million folks who spent their careers working in trucking, \\\\nconstruction and other back breaking industries, were at risk \\\\nof losing nearly everything they worked so hard to save for \\\\ntheir families and for themselves.\\\\n    At the same time, PBGC insurance program backstopping these \\\\nplans was heading toward insolvency in 2026. That was before \\\\nyou became Director. If plans failed, and the PBGC backstop was \\\\nnot there, these retirees would have, as the Director has said \\\\nin his written testimony, received pennies on the dollar.\\\\n    It was not just retirees who were threatened by this \\\\ncrisis. Active workers were contributing to failing plans \\\\nwithout any real help for their retirement, and without \\\\ncommensurate benefit once they retired. Due to the underlying \\\\npension rules, employers in failing plans were having trouble \\\\ngetting access to credit, and having their creditworthiness \\\\nquestioned, threatening their businesses and their employees \\\\nand the retirees.\\\\n    Let us be clear, if the multiemployer pension crisis went \\\\nunaddressed, it would not have been just workers, retirees, and \\\\nemployers who would have been harmed. Taxpayers were also on \\\\nthe hook. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was among those to note \\\\nthat the downstream impact of plans failing, and the \\\\nmultiemployer pension system collapsing, would be an increased \\\\nreliance on social programs and declining tax revenue.\\\\n    According to one estimate, it would cost the Federal \\\\nGovernment at least 170 billion dollars over 10 years, just in \\\\nlost tax revenue, and increased spending on social programs, if \\\\nyou had done nothing, and stayed with the status quo.\\\\n    The picture was bleak and rapidly getting worse. \\\\nFortunately, President Biden and congressional Democrats made \\\\nit a priority to solve the multiemployer pension crisis as \\\\nquickly as we could in a financially responsible way. The \\\\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act established a Special Financial \\\\nAssistance program that provided sufficient assistance to \\\\nfailing plans to fully protect participants&#x27; and our economy. \\\\nIt earned pensions benefits.\\\\n    The SFA program was widely supported by a very diverse \\\\ncoalition of stakeholders, including the AFL-CIO, AARP, UPS and \\\\nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce. How often does the U.S. Chamber \\\\nof Commerce and the AFL-CIO come together to work on problem \\\\nsolving? That was successful because of that broad coalition.\\\\n    It also included scores of employers, businesspeople, small \\\\nand large. They wanted to do what they were required to do and \\\\nalso be able to attract and retain good employees with \\\\nreasonable retirement benefits. To date the SFA program has \\\\nsaved over 775,000 pensions, and protected 3,000 American \\\\nbusinesses, and it is still going.\\\\n    Unfortunately, although impacted workers, retirees and \\\\nemployers reside in states represented by both political \\\\nparties, not one congressional Republican voted in favor of the \\\\nAmerican Rescue Plan. Some of my colleagues continue to \\\\ndisparage the SFA program.\\\\n    Accountability? Yes. PBGC deserves credit for effectively \\\\nand expeditiously implementing the SFA program and being \\\\nresponsive to issues raised by its Office of Inspector General \\\\nregarding the program&#x27;s operation. One such issue, which I \\\\nsuspect we will hear today, already heard about it from my \\\\nRepublican colleagues, pertains to the increased SFA amount of \\\\n127 million that Central States received.\\\\n    First, as the Director notes in his testimony, his written \\\\ntestimony, that PBGC did not make any payments to deceased \\\\nindividuals. Let me repeat that. The PBGC did not make any \\\\npayments to deceased individuals. No Inspector General report \\\\nhas alleged that it has.\\\\n    Second, I understand that PBGC has addressed this issue on \\\\na going forward basis and is working with plans that receive \\\\nSFA to see if anything needs to be fixed retroactively, and \\\\nobviously prospectively.\\\\n    Third, in respect to the Central States issue specifically, \\\\nthe Biden administration&#x27;s announcement from last week should \\\\npave the way for the 127 million to be returned to the U.S. \\\\nTreasury. That 127 million will be returned to the U.S. \\\\nTreasury. I join with Ranking Member Scott in applauding the \\\\nBiden administration&#x27;s announcement, and their continued \\\\nresponsible stewardship of the SFA program.\\\\n    With the Special Financial Assistance Program, President \\\\nBiden and congressional Democrats delivered a historic solution \\\\nto an urgent crisis for American workers, retirees, employers, \\\\ntaxpayers, and business owners. I want to thank the Director \\\\nand the hardworking folks at the PBGC for their efforts to \\\\nimplement and administrate the SFA program.\\\\n    I want to congratulate you for your dedication to solving \\\\nthis difficult problem, and I look forward to a productive \\\\ndiscussion, and yield back.\\\\n    [The Statement of Ranking Member DeSaulnier follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman Good.

I recognize Director Hartogensis for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. GORDON HARTOGENSIS, DIRECTOR, PENSION BENEFIT \\\\n            GUARANTEE CORPORATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Can you hear me now? There we go. Thank \\\\nyou, Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and members of \\\\nthe Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify \\\\ntoday about the important work of the Pension Benefit Guaranty \\\\nCorporation to protect millions of workers and retirees in \\\\nmulti-employer pension plans who face significant cuts to their \\\\nretirement benefits.\\\\n    Before the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act in \\\\n2021, our multi-employer insurance program covering 11 million \\\\nworkers and retirees was facing a solvency crisis. The failures \\\\nof numerous and larger multi-employer plans were imminent, and \\\\nthose failed plans would have turned to PBGC for financial \\\\nassistance.\\\\n    PBGC&#x27;s multi-employer insurance program had a small asset \\\\nbase, and little premium income. Those plan insolvencies would \\\\nhave exhausted the assets of our insurance program in 2026, \\\\nleaving retirees in failed plans with only pennies on the \\\\ndollar. Before ARP, workers and retirees in more than 200 \\\\nseverely underfunded, multi-employer plans faced the loss of \\\\npension benefits they earned and needed to support them and \\\\ntheir families in retirement.\\\\n    They live and work all across the country in industries \\\\nthat include transportation, manufacturing, printing, services, \\\\nconstruction, fishing and hospitality. These plans are \\\\nheadquartered in 31 states including Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, \\\\nIllinois, Texas, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Florida, and \\\\nTennessee. The risk of widespread plan insolvencies, and steep \\\\nincreases in pension costs threaten the viability of many of \\\\nthe tens of thousands of companies that participate in multi-\\\\nemployer plans, most of which are small businesses.\\\\n    The economic shocks resulting from the pandemic made the \\\\ncrisis even more acute. Implementation of SFA is PBGC&#x27;s highest \\\\npriority. Working closely with our board agencies we moved \\\\nexpeditiously and responsibly to implement this unprecedented \\\\nprogram.\\\\n    PBGC is committed to effective stewardship of taxpayer \\\\nfunds and has identified and implemented ongoing improvements \\\\nto the SFA program to further that goal. It is important to \\\\nnote that under this program PBGC does not make any payments to \\\\nindividuals living or deceased.\\\\n    Furthermore, there is no evidence that any of the applicant \\\\nplans intentionally misled PBGC. PBGC has addressed OIG&#x27;s \\\\nrecommendations and are resolving the issue of inaccurate \\\\nparticipant census data in SFA applications. PBGC strongly \\\\nsupports payment of any SFA amount that was paid based on \\\\ninaccurate census data.\\\\n    In November 2023, we took steps to remove deceased \\\\nparticipants from the census data of current and future SFA \\\\napplications by expanding census data requirements for all \\\\nplans, applying to SFA, and by matching this data against the \\\\nSocial Security Administration&#x27;s full file of death \\\\ninformation.\\\\n    PBGC is now conducting full census data audits using the \\\\nSSA&#x27;s full death file for plans that previously received SFA. \\\\nThis process requires that plans verify the SSA death record \\\\nmatches and determine how many beneficiaries or deceased \\\\nparticipants should be reflected in the calculation of the \\\\namount of SFA to which the plan is entitled.\\\\n    Working with our executive branch partners, we are \\\\nimplementing a repayment mechanism for any SFA amounts that \\\\nwere paid based on inaccurate census data. Central States is \\\\ncurrently working cooperatively with the Department of Justice \\\\nCivil Division to agree on the terms and conditions of \\\\nrepayments of the 127 million dollars and are optimistic that \\\\nrepayment will be complete in the very near term.\\\\n    As a result of the ARP&#x27;s Special Financial Assistance \\\\nProgram, PBGC is providing crucial, financial relief to \\\\nstruggling multi-employer pension plans, ensuring that millions \\\\nof America&#x27;s workers, retirees and their families received \\\\ntheir hard-earned pensions.\\\\n    To date, PBGC has approved approximately 53.6 billion \\\\ndollars in SFA to 71 plans that cover around 776,000 workers, \\\\nretirees and beneficiaries. We are prepared for the work ahead \\\\nto complete the application and approval process for the \\\\nremaining eligible plans. The SFA program has turned around the \\\\ncrisis that threatened the retirement security of millions of \\\\nworkers and retirees.\\\\n    Now, through this program, the workers, retirees, and \\\\nbeneficiaries of SFA eligible plans can rely on receiving their \\\\npension benefits far into the future. This concludes my \\\\nremarks. Thank you again, and I am happy to answer your \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    [The Statement of Hon. Hartogensis follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you. Under Committee Rule 9, we will \\\\nnow question witnesses under the 5-minute rule. I will wait to \\\\nask my questions at the end, and then I will therefore \\\\nrecognize Mr. Walberg from Michigan for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you Mr. \\\\nHartogensis for being here. It gives us a chance to seek for \\\\nthe truth, find answers because I am hearing things that I do \\\\nnot perceive to be as accurate to my understanding. Coming from \\\\nMichigan and having met with countless number of Central \\\\nState&#x27;s pensioners, as well as employers, I understand the \\\\nreal-world consequences that would have taken place had the \\\\nfund gone under.\\\\n    However, we in Congress are charged with being responsible \\\\nstewards of taxpayer money, and taxpayers who did not \\\\nparticipate in the pension have now been asked to take care of \\\\nfooting the bill to prop it up, so learning that the PBGC \\\\nissued Central States 127 million dollars overpayment based on \\\\ndata that included dead participants, data that the PBGC did \\\\nnot doublecheck, I would consider that negligence.\\\\n    Let me ask you this question. On February 9th, PBGC said \\\\nthat it could not recover it is special financial assistance \\\\noverpayments, yet on March 14th, the Department of Labor posted \\\\na statement that says plans must repay overpayments made based \\\\non dead participants on the multi-employer plan census rolls.\\\\n    Could you please explain by PBGC&#x27;s response differs from \\\\nDOL&#x27;s statement, and what is the PBGC&#x27;s current stance on \\\\nwhether it will recover the 127 million?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Okay. I will start with the second \\\\nquestion first. Our current stance is that we are committed to \\\\nrecovering 127 million as well as any other money that was paid \\\\nto any other plan for the, you know, for the same reason.\\\\n    Stepping back a bit. When we, you know, back in 2021, when \\\\nwe were charged with implementing the SFA program, we went \\\\nthrough a process where we had--the law gave us 120 days to \\\\nlisten to stakeholders, to come up with ideas of standing up \\\\nthe program, write the regulations, come up--get those \\\\nregulations through, you know, Board and OMB approval, and then \\\\nget the program going.\\\\n    It was, the program was designed to get up and running very \\\\nquickly because we, you know, we were in the middle of a multi-\\\\nemployer crisis. There were many plans that had gone insolvent. \\\\nPeople had--participants had taken benefit cuts. There were \\\\nplans where the participant had taken steep cuts under----\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. I am certainly aware of that.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. We--as we went to stand up the program, we \\\\nlooked at how what data could we use to cross check in that \\\\ndata, and it made the most sense at the time to look at \\\\ngovernment data that the 5,500 in premium filings that had been \\\\nreported to us before the enactment of ARP.\\\\n    The idea is to make sure that they--we are looking at data \\\\nthat cannot be changed after the enactment. We then we stood up \\\\nthe program. At the time the complexity of using the social \\\\nsecurity death master file is that plans themselves did not \\\\nhave access to that data.\\\\n    Fast forward when our IG asked us to use the social \\\\nsecurity death master file, you know, to you know, to basically \\\\ncross check the information, we agreed to do that. We ran into \\\\na--and we fixed the problem going forward. We ran into a legal \\\\nsnag in terms of going backward.\\\\n    The legal snag was our Office of General Counsel in \\\\nconcurrence with the--\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. They told you--you have been told now to pay \\\\nit back.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. What is that?\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. You have been told now to pay it back.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes----\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. Have you started discussions with the Central \\\\nStates about how they are going to return the taxpayer money? \\\\nThat is my key question.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. We--the legal snag that we ran into was \\\\nthat our Office of General Counsel said that we could not \\\\ndirectly, ourselves, recoup that money, the 127 million \\\\ndollars. What we did is we worked, we reached out to executive \\\\nbranch partners, and the Department of Justice, Department of \\\\nLabor, and worked with them to find a collaborative solution \\\\nwhere we could in fact recoup the money.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. What I understand now, and I have 8 seconds, \\\\nbut so far you have approved 53.6 billion in special financial \\\\nassistance?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. What are you doing to ensure the same error \\\\nwas not also made with respect to the other payments that were \\\\nprevious? It does not look like we are learning from it. We are \\\\nstill expending.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. What we have done is--so for the payments \\\\nthat have gone before, what we have done is, at this point, we \\\\nhave actually reached out to all the plans, so in total 67 \\\\nplans have been paid special financial assistance, before we \\\\nstarted doing a full death master file scrub, if you will. One \\\\nof those is Central States. There are 66 others.\\\\n    Mr. Walberg. Mr. Chair, I know my time is over, and we will \\\\nlook for further background information on it because this just \\\\nis not cutting it. The answers here and saying that we did not \\\\npay out to dead people, and now seeing that we are going \\\\nforward still doing it is a concern. Thank you, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Walberg. I will now recognize \\\\nMr. Courtney from Connecticut for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis: You cannot hear me? Okay. Is that better?\\\\n    Ms. Foxx. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis: No problem.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Mr. Courtney.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Madam \\\\nChairwoman for getting the audio where it should be, and to our \\\\nwitness for being here today. When we talk about what is not \\\\ncutting it, this Committee actually going back, really to the \\\\ntwenty-teens, has been the place where the multiemployer \\\\npension crisis has been playing out year in and year out.\\\\n    I think it is important for the record to reflect that in \\\\n2014 there was an attempt, and it was well-intentioned. The \\\\nmultiemployer pension assistance bill was enacted to try and \\\\ngive the multiemployers what was hoped for, flexibility to try \\\\nand rescue their financial crisis.\\\\n    As your chart on page 2 of your testimony pretty powerfully \\\\ndemonstrates, is that it really was not cutting it. I mean \\\\nthese plans were still sort of cascading in a negative \\\\ndirection, and the authorities that were given in that 2014 \\\\nlaw, which basically allowed plans to cut benefits to retirees. \\\\nI mean that--actually was where the burden hit, was actually \\\\nretired workers who had paid in faithfully to their pensions, \\\\nhad negotiated in good faith over the years, giving up wage \\\\nincreases, et cetera.\\\\n    Clearly with COVID, as your chart shows, I mean we had to \\\\nact, or these plans just would have gone belly up. I mean your \\\\ntestimony is that if we had done nothing, it would have been \\\\n2026 before we would see sort of large numbers of bankruptcy. \\\\nIs that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. That is correct, 2026 was the projected \\\\ninsolvency of the PBGC, based on large insolvencies at Central \\\\nStates and other plans.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. Which would have affected single employer \\\\nplans as well as multi-employer plans. I mean it just would \\\\nhave been----\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, it would not have. The two programs \\\\nare legally separate.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. Separate. That is right, thank you. Okay. \\\\nThat is good to get that clarification. The U.S. Chamber of \\\\nCommerce, who came forward to support the ARPA bill and this \\\\nprogram, they actually took a look at the question of taxpayer \\\\nimpact, and their estimate was is that if again, the \\\\ncatastrophe had happened, and the multi-employer plans would \\\\nhave been basically bankrupt, that the impact in terms of \\\\ntaxpayers would be 170 billion dollars.\\\\n    That was a conservative estimate in terms of just payments \\\\nfor social assistance programs. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. If you evaluate what the choice was before \\\\nCongress, and your agency, the fact is that the ARPA was the \\\\nmore cost-effective solution in terms of rescuing these plans, \\\\nand not putting the hardship on retirees. Is that also correct?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I think it is a combination of the \\\\nstress on social safety net, the social safety net. Then the \\\\nhuman toll of people losing their pensions, and then \\\\nbankruptcies by employers. I think there are a lot of, there \\\\nare a lot of collateral damage would have happened.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. I know Ranking Member reiterated twice in his \\\\nopening remarks that no payments were made to estates of \\\\ndeceased retirees directly from your Agency, and in fact, the \\\\nmoney is still being--is still held within the Central States \\\\nplan, is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, it is.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. This is not a situation where, you know, \\\\nsometimes Social Security overpays a recipient at time of \\\\ndeath, maybe a month or two where they have to claw it back. I \\\\nmean this is really a negotiation that is happening between the \\\\nFederal Government and the Central State plan in terms of \\\\nrecoupment. Is that?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. It is. That 127 million dollars is in \\\\na ``lock box,&#x27;&#x27; so to speak, and we are currently negotiating \\\\nwith them over the return.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. Again, it is really just a question of who is \\\\ngot the lines of authority on the Federal Government side, so \\\\nit is the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor \\\\nthat are the primary entities that are engaged in that \\\\nrecoupment?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. They are right now. The main, the \\\\nlead is the Department of Justice at this point.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. You totally cooperated with the Inspector \\\\nGeneral&#x27;s Office once they flagged, or identified this issue? \\\\nMaybe with your assistance, identified this issue? I mean this \\\\nhas not been a contested process.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. No. Not at all. We cooperated immediately, \\\\nand we fixed the problem going forward as quickly as possible \\\\nbecause that was the priority. To kind of stem the problem as \\\\nquickly as possible, and then work with our executive branch \\\\npartners on recovering going backward, which was more \\\\ncomplicated.\\\\n    Mr. Courtney. I mean based on what your data shows, this \\\\nhas been a win/win for the taxpayer. It has been a win/win for \\\\nthe retiree, and it has been a win/win for the employers. \\\\nAgain, despite the best efforts that Congress made in 2014, \\\\nwhich was not working, this really ended up, again, rescuing \\\\nthe financial security of hundreds of thousands of Americans \\\\nand their families, and protected this program in terms of its \\\\nfuture existence. With that, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Courtney. I now recognize \\\\nChairwoman Foxx for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am really deeply \\\\ndisappointed that it took dogged work from Chairman Good and me \\\\nto get you and the Department of Labor to see reason, and to \\\\nrecover the Federal payments for dead people. It is outrageous \\\\nthat this took any time whatsoever, and that PBGC did not \\\\nimmediately own up to its mistake and recover taxpayer funds.\\\\n    In your comments you talked about getting the money out to \\\\nthe pension people, and you talk about their being taxpayers, \\\\nbut this money is coming from other taxpayers who do not have \\\\nthe benefit in many cases, of having a pension. You are worried \\\\nabout that.\\\\n    I support what my colleague from Michigan was talking \\\\nabout. You say you have paid out the 62 plans. Did you follow \\\\nthe rules on those other 62 plans that were in place that you \\\\nfailed to follow on the Central States, or are you going to get \\\\nthe money back that has been improperly paid there probably?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. We are going to get the money back on all \\\\nof them. That is----\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Okay. Well, my question is why did you not \\\\nfollow the plan to begin with? You had rules on what you were \\\\nsupposed to do, and you ignored them.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Are you speaking about the 2018 OIG \\\\nreport?\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Well, yes. You did not follow what the rule was \\\\nfor how to do this for looking at the death rolls. Why did you \\\\nnot do that? What was your interpretation that allowed you to \\\\nignore that?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. We first of all standing up this program \\\\nin 2021 was an unprecedented program. When we looked at it \\\\nthere was a recommendation from our IG to use the social \\\\nsecurity death master file in our regular financial assistance \\\\nprograms, those are direct payments to beneficiaries. This \\\\nprogram was not as easy to use that because the plans \\\\nthemselves don&#x27;t have access to that file.\\\\n    For us to require them to use it, they could not do it. If \\\\nwe cross checked with that they would have all failed because \\\\nwe would have found dead people they did not find. When our IG \\\\nrecommended that we do it, we said okay. We will work and make \\\\nthis program better. As an improvement, what we had to do was \\\\nwe had to get their census data ahead of time, have a pre-\\\\napplication process, cross check it.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. You were supposed to do that at the beginning. \\\\nMy understanding was that you were supposed to do that before \\\\nyou turned out the money. I understand you have said census \\\\ndata is just one of the multiple factors that contributed to \\\\nthe imprecision of assumptions, so participant rolls and census \\\\ndata from multi-employer pension plans are fact, not \\\\nassumptions.\\\\n    I am asking you what authority did you have for the novel \\\\ninterpretation that payments for dead people were actuarial \\\\nassumptions?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, there was no blueprint for standing \\\\nup this program. In fact, we used the data that we had. Our IG \\\\ndid not recommend that we cross check with the social security \\\\ndeath master file until March 2023. Almost 2 years into the \\\\nrunning of the program, and it was recommended as an \\\\nimprovement to the program, and we agreed, and we said we will \\\\nimprove the program.\\\\n    We, you know, made efforts to agree with the \\\\nrecommendations from the IG going forward. Then looking \\\\nbackward, it was more complicated to retroactively fix this, \\\\nand audit the plans and recover the money.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Well, in your opening statement it sounded like \\\\na lot of excuses for what has happened with the PBGC, and \\\\nthankfully the IG was on top of this, and found 127 million \\\\ndollars that belonged to the taxpayers of this country, not \\\\njust the people that were getting it. We want the PBGC to do \\\\nwhat it is supposed to do, and follow the rules in the future.\\\\n    We want you to go back to these other plans, which you \\\\nindicated earlier that where you did not follow the rules \\\\neither. It is important. This money is important. We should not \\\\nbe--you all acted like 127 million dollars was not significant. \\\\nDo we have a commitment from you that you are going to pay \\\\nattention to all of the money?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, absolutely. You do have a commitment, \\\\nand 127 million dollars is very significant to us. It is \\\\nimportant to the reputation of the PBGC and the program, and we \\\\nintend to go after all of the money.\\\\n    Mrs. Foxx. Mr. Chairman, one quick point of personal \\\\nprivilege please. We have two guests in the room that I would \\\\nlike to recognize, Sarah Holland, who is the Principal Clerk \\\\nfor the North Carolina Senate, and Julie Bradburn, the Counsel \\\\nfor the Rules Committee are here. They are visiting with our \\\\nparliamentarian, and attending, and I thank you for your \\\\nindulgence. Thank you so much.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. We will now \\\\nrecognize Mr. Norcross from New Jersey for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Thank you, Chairman. Director, can you remind \\\\nus of what year you were appointed to your position?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. 2019.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Who was President at the time?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. President Trump.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Okay. For the record, because apparently we \\\\nare missing some of this. Did you make any payments to dead \\\\npeople?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. No.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Any pensions? No. I did not think so. We are \\\\nlooking at 127 million. Myself, Ranking Member Scott, back in \\\\nthe 116th Congress served on a Joint Commission of \\\\nMultiemployer Pensions, along with many others who brought \\\\nincredible testimony about the complexity of the multiemployer \\\\nsystem, a system that employed a--previous to that point, and \\\\nhad looked at ways of how we could fix the system that had \\\\ninherent problems.\\\\n    I might remind people on this Committee that multiemployers \\\\nare very different than a single employer. A single employer \\\\ndefaults, it goes under, it is pretty simple. The multiemployer \\\\nsystem was set up so groups of employers could gather together \\\\nto cover their employees.\\\\n    Unlike other systems, if an employer of the group would go \\\\nbankrupt, the other employers picked up the unfunded balance. \\\\nLet me repeat that. No government within themselves picked up \\\\nwhen another employer went under. That is a fundamental issue \\\\nof a multiemployer plan, and one of the complexities.\\\\n    It also has saved thousands of employer plans over the \\\\nyears. However, there were major issues with the returns and \\\\nthings that went on after this. At the end of the joint session \\\\nthere were recommendations made that were not enacted. Then \\\\ncame ARP, and what we saw because through no fault of their \\\\nown, employees put aside their wages into a pension system that \\\\nwas collapsing.\\\\n    PBGC had indicated that if things continued the way it was \\\\nthen in 2026 the system would then collapse. Is that your \\\\nunderstanding?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. It would have.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Then in fact, I think Bobby Scott actually \\\\ncame up with a study that close to 170 billion dollars of \\\\ndirect cost to our economy would go along with that. I think \\\\nthat was low, and that could be much higher. There was 127 \\\\nmillion in question whether or not it should have gone because \\\\nof the use of an improper data base.\\\\n    That has now been corrected. That has now been pointed out, \\\\nwhich is exactly what should have been done. You are not going \\\\nto get an attaboy for using the other system, but it was fixed. \\\\nThe money is coming back, is it not?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, it is.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Okay. In your time that serving in PBGC, have \\\\nyou ever had a pensioner call you up and say, ``Do not send me \\\\nmy check. I do not deserve it?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. It has not happened yet.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Has not happened yet. Do you think it might \\\\nhappen?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Probably not.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. I do not think so either. This is about \\\\nhelping ordinary Americans, the ones who want to work their \\\\nlives, play by the rules, and have a little nest egg at the \\\\nend. That is what we are talking about here. They want to turn \\\\nthis into something it is not, and that is incredibly hurtful. \\\\nIf you sat through the hearings that Mr. Scott and I did, to \\\\nhear when a person loses their pension, which is their \\\\nlifeline, something that they saved for their entire life.\\\\n    The sense that workers in both blue and red states got \\\\npension checks, did they not?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Okay. I am just trying to understand where \\\\nthe hell this hearing is going, other than the money is going \\\\nto get paid back. It was identified, and we are following the \\\\nrules. The fact of the matter is, there is still a lot of \\\\npeople out there in systems that are going to be helped by the \\\\nSFA, are they not?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Norcross. Okay. It might sound a little rhetorical, \\\\nwhich is what I think this hearing is, a little rhetorical. \\\\nInstead of trying to band together to help those who are \\\\nretiring, that cannot go back out to work necessarily. I want \\\\nto thank you for what we are doing to fix the system, what you \\\\nare doing to get the money out each and every day, and most \\\\nimportantly, that together for pensioners whose money was saved \\\\nbecause of what we did in Congress, I think it is incredibly \\\\nimportant to point out.\\\\n    I implore to this Committee to remember that, and I would \\\\nlike a point of personal privilege to point out we have Michael \\\\nScott, who testified a while back in with the NCCMP, and we \\\\nhave Jared Karbowsky from NECA who was instrumental in helping \\\\nget these along, and just many people in this room helped us \\\\nhelp those pensioners. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Norcross. We will now \\\\nrecognize Ms. McBath from Georgia for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mrs. McBath. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member \\\\nDeSaulnier, and thank you, Director, for being here with us as \\\\nwell. I am glad to be here today to discuss one of \\\\ncongressional Democrats&#x27; and President Biden&#x27;s greatest \\\\nachievements, savings the pensions, and the hardworking earned \\\\nretirements of over a million working families in this country.\\\\n    Working families that have done everything right, and they \\\\nhave contributed to their pensions for years, they deserve the \\\\npeace of mind that what they have worked so hard for is safe. \\\\nToday&#x27;s hearing just really gives us an opportunity to raise \\\\nawareness about this incredible achievement.\\\\n    When you spend enough time in Washington, or even listening \\\\nto the news, it is very, sometimes it is just very \\\\ndisheartening to hear about at times the lack of progress, but \\\\nthis was different. Saving the pensions of so many Americans, \\\\nthis was truly a great achievement.\\\\n    We got to ensure that over a million people that we have \\\\nsworn to protect and to serve, will be able to enjoy their \\\\ngolden years at home, and I am one of those too that looks \\\\nforward to receiving a pension. Will be able to, you know, to \\\\nspend their golden years with their families in comfort, and \\\\nnot have to worry about being forced to go back to work at the \\\\nage of 70, or possibly lose the house that they raised their \\\\nkids in, and that is truly not lost on me.\\\\n    The White House and Congress, we understood this urgency, \\\\nand the magnitude of the crisis, in particular, coming through \\\\nCOVID19, and we sprang into action, and we passed the American \\\\nRescue Plan. Unfortunately, some of our congressional \\\\nRepublicans opposed this effort, and failed to protect \\\\nhardworking Americans and their retirement security.\\\\n    If this was just about union members, as some have \\\\nsuggested, who let me be clear, also deserve our support, and \\\\nshould not be wrongly vilified the way that they have been \\\\nbefore this Committee time and time again, then why did the \\\\nUnited States Chamber of Commerce support it?\\\\n    You may hear differently from my colleagues today, but \\\\nemployers strongly supported these provisions of the American \\\\nRescue Plan, and we should not forget that. According to them, \\\\nwithout Federal assistance, there would have been 1.3 million \\\\nAmericans who would have seen their retirement benefits cut by \\\\nas much as 98 percent within the next few years.\\\\n    I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record two \\\\nendorsement letters signed by dozens of companies, including \\\\nUPS, who has a big presence in my district in Georgia, and \\\\nthroughout the entire State of Georgia. I am proud to represent \\\\nthis company, and the workers who get up every single day, and \\\\nthey move this country forward.\\\\n    UPS was one of the leading voices urging Congress to \\\\naddress the multiemployer crisis. In 2018, they testified \\\\nbefore us here in Congress, and mentioned that UPS began \\\\ncontributing to multiemployer pension plans and contributes 2 \\\\nbillion dollars per year to 27 different plans across the \\\\ncountry. UPS understood what was at stake, and for years they \\\\nwere demanding that Congress act, and I am so grateful that we \\\\ndid.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Without objection.\\\\n    [The information of Mrs. McBath follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mrs. McBath. Director, can you talk about the importance of \\\\nthe American Rescue Plan Act to employers like UPS, and all the \\\\nother employers that have worked so hard to help support their \\\\nemployees?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. What the, you know, the SFA program \\\\nas part of the American Rescue Plan Act did was it provided \\\\nstability for employers that use union labor. Those that \\\\ncontribute to multiemployer plans. There was a real risk of \\\\ninsolvency of these plans, which creates withdraw liability.\\\\n    It creates a bill coming due, and that withdraw liability \\\\nand it creates an overhang, so for a lot of employers it makes \\\\nit harder for them to borrow money because the banks when they \\\\nare looking at making a loan to them, see this huge obligation \\\\nthat is growing and growing from having to contribute to these \\\\ninsolvent plans.\\\\n    It becomes harder for them to get loans, and a lot of small \\\\nand large businesses that cannot get loans when they otherwise \\\\nwould have been able to, and it creates bankruptcies in some \\\\ncases. I mean there is a lot of collateral damage that was \\\\navoided by rescuing the multiemployer pension system.\\\\n    Mrs. McBath. Is there anything going forward you believe \\\\nthat we here in Congress can do to continue to make sure that \\\\nwe are sufficiently supporting families and our workers?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I think there is the possibility for \\\\nfuture reforms to the multiemployer system. The ARP, you know, \\\\nthrough the SFA program within ARP was designed to essentially \\\\nrescue the program for 30 years, but looking out beyond that, \\\\nthere are reforms that we could work on with you that, you \\\\nknow, some things that came out of the 2018 Joint Select \\\\nCommittee, and other efforts that could make it even more \\\\nsolvent.\\\\n    Mrs. McBath. Thank you so much. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. The gentlelady&#x27;s time is expired. I now \\\\nrecognize Ms. Hayes from Connecticut for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. Director, were you finished with \\\\nyour answer to the last question?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. Well, my remarks are similar to many \\\\nof my colleagues, so your answer probably would have probably \\\\nanswered my questions as well because the efforts by House \\\\nDemocrats to save multiemployer pensions are important, and \\\\nthey bear repeating.\\\\n    I actually am happy that we are holding this hearing, so \\\\nthat the American people can really, truly appreciate and \\\\nunderstand all of the work that we did to make sure that their \\\\npensions remain solvent, and that these plans that they paid \\\\ninto they could expect a return on them.\\\\n    The challenges facing multiemployer pension systems are not \\\\nnew. Democrats in the House and Senate passed the American \\\\nRescue Plan, which created the Special Financial Assistance \\\\nProgram, and provided the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \\\\nwith the resources to save the multiemployer pension programs.\\\\n    Without the American Rescue Plan, nearly 1 million workers \\\\nand retirees could have seen their pensions and benefits that \\\\nthey earned and contributed to disappear. In rescuing these \\\\nfailed pension plans, we saved at least 170 billion dollars \\\\nover 10 years in lost tax revenue, and increased spending to \\\\ncare for retirees.\\\\n    Again, not a single Republican supported the American \\\\nRescue Plan. My question to you is how would the economic \\\\nrecovery from the COVID-19 pandemic have looked if the Special \\\\nFinancial Assistance Program had not been established?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I think No. 1, as I commented in my \\\\nprevious answer, there would have been more bankruptcies of \\\\nsmall businesses. I think there would have been a lot of \\\\nretirees that would have lost their pensions, or been stuck \\\\nwith severe cuts, and I think there would have been more draws \\\\non the social safety net programs.\\\\n    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I mean what I try to do on this \\\\nCommittee, a lot of our work is supporting employers, but also \\\\nmaking sure that we are mindful of the needs of employees. We \\\\nhave to balance our legislation to make sure that we are \\\\nmeeting the needs of everyone that we serve.\\\\n    The multiemployer pension crisis harmed not only retirees \\\\nand businesses, but also active workers. For instance, \\\\nemployers in failing plans like the Central States pension \\\\nfund, were making pension contributions for active workers who \\\\nwould never receive a benefit equal to what they paid, and \\\\nthat&#x27;s just unfair. A 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report \\\\nfound workers were less likely to stay with their employer when \\\\nthey understood their pension would be less than expected.\\\\n    Director, can you explain how the multiemployer pension \\\\ncrisis negatively impacted workers, and additionally, how are \\\\nworkers today benefiting from the Special Financial Assistance \\\\nProgram?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I think that you, it is obviously it \\\\nis a retention problem if you are earning a pension, and the \\\\nyou know, the pension is, you know, 20 percent funded, or you \\\\nknow, you get to the point where you do not believe the money \\\\nis going to be there when you retire, so you are less likely to \\\\nstick with that company, or stay with that union, or pay into \\\\nthat pension plan.\\\\n    Mrs. Hayes. Right. I guess I would say that the people who \\\\nrely the most on their pension plans are generally people who \\\\nhave no other income sources, or are planning for retirement \\\\nand looking at every dollar that they&#x27;ve paid in. We are not \\\\ntalking about the wealthiest people who do not care what they \\\\nare going to collect in retirement.\\\\n    We are talking about people who work every day, who pay \\\\ninto these pension programs, who understand at the time they \\\\nare hired what their pension portfolio will look like, and make \\\\nintentional investments into these programs throughout their \\\\nentire careers with the expectation that they will get that \\\\nmoney back when they retire.\\\\n    I am very proud of the work that we did as House Democrats \\\\nto save those pension plans, and ultimately protect the \\\\nretirement of American workers. With that, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, and we will now recognize my \\\\nfriend from Virginia, Mr. Scott, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. \\\\nDirector, as I understand it the plans were entitled to support \\\\nfrom the Rescue fix based on the number of participants they \\\\nhad. Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Some of those participants may have died \\\\nrecently unbeknownst to the plan. Did the plans have access to \\\\ndata to get the most recent update, and when you are talking \\\\nabout tens of thousands of people, did the plans have access to \\\\ndata that could have revealed the number of people that have \\\\ndied?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. The plans have access to private sector \\\\ndeath audits, which are not as accurate as the Social Security \\\\nfull death master file.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. They got--some got a little more than they were \\\\nentitled to. Now, the 170 million dollars that is frequently \\\\ntalked about, that was, as I understand it, it was about one \\\\nthird of 1 percent of the total payment to the plan. Is that \\\\nright?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. The Central States payment was .35 \\\\npercent.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Okay. You have, as I understand it, fixed this \\\\nby requiring all future applications to send you their list of \\\\nparticipants that you can run through the Social Security \\\\nsystem to get any recent deaths, and cover this problem?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, we have.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. You are working to get information from those \\\\nplans that have already been helped to make sure that they were \\\\nnot overpaid by running their lists through the Social Security \\\\nsystem to get the most accurate data? Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. We are looking back at all of those \\\\nplans.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Okay. We have fixed it prospectively, and we are \\\\nworking retroactively to fix this problem?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes, we are.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Okay. We have heard a lot about the 170-billion-\\\\ndollar cost, not to the economy generally, but to the Federal \\\\nbudget based on decreased tax revenue and increased social \\\\nsafety net if we let these plans fail, and that is without \\\\nconsidering the pain suffered by people who lose their \\\\npensions, by businesses going broke trying to keep the plants \\\\nafloat.\\\\n    Small towns suffering by decreased real eState taxes, banks \\\\nsuffering by people not being able to pay their loans, 170 \\\\nbillion dollars in the first 10 years, and a lot more after \\\\nthat. What was the cost of fixing the problem?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Our latest projection is 79.7 billion \\\\ndollars.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Less than half of the cost of doing nothing, and \\\\navoiding all of that pain? Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Okay. We have obviously been focused on the \\\\nimpact on the pensions themselves. What impact would the \\\\nfailure of these plans have on businesses?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. The, like in my earlier remarks, they \\\\nwould have trouble getting loans. That is the biggest problem. \\\\nThe overhang and withdrawal liability from insolvent or \\\\ndeclining multiemployer plans would make it hard for them to \\\\nget loans, which could, which would rescue them if these \\\\nbusinesses got into a pinch.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. The banks would know that they have a potential \\\\nliability more than they would ever be able to pay.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Their loan would be behind that, so they are not \\\\ncredit worthy, so the businesses could not operate as a normal \\\\nbusiness because they cannot, if they ever had a shortfall in \\\\ncash-flow, they cannot borrow money?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. That is probably why there was \\\\nChamber of Commerce support for this.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Chamber of Commerce supported the plan?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. How many businesses have you saved already?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I think it is about 3,000 businesses that \\\\nare involved with the 71 plans that were approved.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Do you expect more businesses to be saved as you \\\\ngo forward?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Scott, and now we will \\\\nrecognize our Ranking Member from California for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director, thanks \\\\nagain for being here. Just to followup on the excellent 5 \\\\nminutes by my friend from New Jersey, who has a lot of \\\\nexperience in this field. You were nominated by the ex-\\\\nRepublican President for this position, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Um-hmm.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. You were confirmed by the Republican \\\\ncontrolled Senate, Senator Hatch I believe was the Chair of \\\\nCommittee of Jurisdiction. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. It was, yes. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. You were confirmed by the Republican \\\\nmajority. This is the same time, just if memory serves me, that \\\\nthat same majority passed the largest tax cut for the top 1 \\\\npercent in the history of the country, and that money is all it \\\\nturns out, according to the CBO, has not trickled down, has not \\\\ngone out in the economy. It has largely been retained by that \\\\ngroup. That is just an editorial comment from me.\\\\n    We have talked a lot about the top line members. We have \\\\ngot lots of stories to this Committee, and from the Select \\\\nCommittee. Testimony about individual people, individual \\\\nstories. Those numbers. I read about a couple, a truck driver \\\\nin North Dakota, who said, well, what am I going to do if I do \\\\nnot have my retirement?\\\\n    Another freight truck driver in the Midwest who said how am \\\\nI going to get a job in my 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s driving a truck when I \\\\nneed to get a knee replacement? I cannot make my mortgage. Tell \\\\nme what is the average that these people are getting in pension \\\\nbenefits, in a year based on what you did, and what the average \\\\nwould be if you did not have done what you did?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Okay. We--let us take Central States, for \\\\nexample. The truck drivers, I think the average across the \\\\nboard is about $16,000.00 a year in terms of the pension \\\\nbenefit that they would have gotten. For long-term workers it \\\\nis close, it is somewhere between $25,000.00 and $30,000.00 a \\\\nyear. That is the approximate range.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Let us, maybe we can give you a few minutes \\\\nhere, or moments, to just we have reiterated this over and over \\\\nagain about some of the accusations about mismanagement about \\\\npaying checks to deceased people.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Do you want to add anything either on that, \\\\non what you did as you look back on it, and anything that has \\\\ncome up in this hearing that you would like to clarify further \\\\nabout what your actions were able to accomplish given, that you \\\\napproach this from my view, from being very, very fiscally \\\\nresponsible?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I think to add to your comment that \\\\nyou said, I mean this program has gone out to help people in \\\\nthe $15,000.00 to $30,000.00 a year pension range. These are \\\\nhardworking folks. I think the one takeaway from the theme of \\\\nthis is No. 1, the SFA Program, the PBGC did not make any \\\\npayments to participants, so there has been some press that we \\\\nare--the program has been used to pay dead people. That is not \\\\ntrue at all.\\\\n    All the money from this program has gone to plans based on \\\\na 30-year projection. We do understand that the way the program \\\\nwas set up, if we knew 3 years ago what we know now, we would \\\\nhave used the Social Security death master file from the get-\\\\ngo. It is a more accurate data base.\\\\n    We did not, our IG flagged it for us in 2023. We have fixed \\\\nthis, you know, we fixed our procedures and our review process \\\\nto use the social security death master file going forward, so \\\\nany improvements and any approvals going forward will be using \\\\nthat. We ran into some complexities in terms of going backward, \\\\nand recovering the money, which should be recovered for the \\\\ntaxpayer.\\\\n    We believe that we have got it fixed. We have worked with \\\\nthe Department of Labor and Department of Justice, and we \\\\nbelieve we have a solution and we will be able to take care of \\\\nit in the near term.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Wonderful response, the IG and you working \\\\ntogether to correct something that was identified with no loss.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. You inherited all that situation, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. The multiemployer crisis?\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Um-hmm?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Yes. I, when I came in I think my first \\\\nyear the net position of the multiemployer program was about \\\\nnegative 65 billion dollars.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. I might add, this is something that the \\\\nSelect Committee put a lot of time into but was a national \\\\nproblem. I know Western States, for instance, I am a former \\\\nTeamster, you know, the different financial situations for \\\\ndifferent parts of the country and plans are interesting to \\\\nlook back at.\\\\n    This was all inherited in a very difficult, complex \\\\nsituation that you fixed, so thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you to the Ranking Member. We will now \\\\nrecognize Mr. Banks from Indiana for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Banks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being \\\\nhere today. From time to time, I hear from constituents who \\\\nthese days are concerned with high interest rates, and what \\\\nthat is doing to the value of their pension plans. I am \\\\nwondering if you can talk about how can policymakers like us \\\\nprovide solutions, and work with you to address some of those \\\\nconcerns that employers and constituents have about the value \\\\nof their pension plan due to high interest rates?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, that is a great question. I think \\\\nhigh interest rates actually have been generally a good thing \\\\nfor defined benefit pension plans. The way that the liabilities \\\\nare measured, the higher interest rates shrink the calculation \\\\nof the liabilities. It makes the plan more solvent. In fact, as \\\\na very recent study, the multi-employer pension system, \\\\nincluding the SFA Rescue is now about 89 percent funded.\\\\n    It has improved the funding ratios, and it has actually \\\\nmade defined benefit pension plans easier for employers to \\\\noffer, because they essentially, they can lay off the \\\\nliabilities hedge more easily with fixed income because they \\\\ncan get more return for the money.\\\\n    Mr. Banks. You are talking about pension smoothing? What \\\\ndoes that mean, and what is the difference between pension \\\\nsmoothing for multi-employer plans versus single employer \\\\nplans?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. That is a good question. The idea of \\\\npension smoothing is that as interest rates kind of they go up, \\\\nthey go down, you know, if you look back to between the early \\\\n2000&#x27;s to, I guess 2021, interest rates were very low, near \\\\nzero. The idea behind that is to because the way that \\\\ncalculations are done within defined benefit pension plans, for \\\\nthe purposes of, I guess funding, like the funding rules that \\\\nthe Congress passes on them.\\\\n    Smoothing means you can kind of look back at average rates \\\\nover a longer period of time, so that the calculations that \\\\nhappen do not jump up and down as quickly. They are more \\\\ngradual. Then obviously when rates rose more recently, the \\\\nsmoothing makes that rise in rates as it is appreciated by \\\\npension plans more gradual.\\\\n    Mr. Banks. What happens when rates go down?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. It is the same thing.\\\\n    Mr. Banks. It is good for high rates, but when the rates go \\\\nback down.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. It keeps the calculation of rates, you \\\\nknow, higher for longer, and then they fall more slowly.\\\\n    Mr. Banks. Okay. Interesting. Just last week the DOL \\\\nconfirmed that the Central States pension plan must pay back \\\\nthe excessive funds they received through the American Rescue \\\\nPlan&#x27;s Special Financial Assistance. Have you seen any pushback \\\\nfrom Central States to pay back those funds?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. No. I have not, and I believe we have been \\\\nworking with our executive branch partner agencies to recover \\\\nthat money, and actually think that that is going to be paid \\\\nback in very short order.\\\\n    Mr. Banks. Why did the Executive Director of Central States \\\\npension plan ask the DOL if it was lawful to repay PBGC under \\\\nERISA?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. That was a fiduciary concern. The idea \\\\nbeing that they were concerned that if they paid back the 127 \\\\nmillion dollars out of plan assets, there could be lawsuits \\\\nfrom participants saying why did you give our money away.\\\\n    The fiduciary regulator over pension plans is the \\\\nDepartment of Labor, so for them saying you can do this, this \\\\nis rightful, it removes a roadblock, that was helpful.\\\\n    Mr. Banks. What is your message to American taxpayers who \\\\nare concerned about having to bailout another multi-State \\\\npension plan on the horizon, as they watch this situation of \\\\nbailing out Central States? How do you explain that to \\\\ntaxpayers?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Are you talking about just the 127 \\\\nmillion? That issue, or the entire program?\\\\n    Mr. Banks. Well, all the above. I mean the precedent that \\\\nwe are setting and the bailout. I mean how do you explain that? \\\\nWhat would be your message to taxpayers why that is fair?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I think first of all, in terms of just the \\\\n127 million dollars that we acknowledge that that is if we had \\\\nto do it over again, we would have done it differently, and we \\\\nare taking all steps to correct that, and the taxpayers have a \\\\nright to expect us to do that, and we are going to do it.\\\\n    As far as the entire program, I would say that this is a \\\\nunique case where a series of things led to a crisis that was \\\\nso great it was going impact large parts of the country, \\\\ncommunities all over the place. You know, in many, many \\\\ndifferent states, and the collateral damage was going to be so \\\\nlarge that it was going to be detrimental.\\\\n    That is why there was, you know, kind of support from the \\\\nChamber of Commerce, as well as from labor groups. I would say \\\\nthat the main focus should be let is make sure this does not \\\\nhappen again.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired, \\\\nand we now recognize Ms. Manning from North Carolina for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Ms. Mannings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When I was first \\\\nelected to Congress, one of the most pressing issues facing us \\\\nwas the impending collapse of several multiemployer pension \\\\nplans and the potential insolvency of the PBGC. Had the plans \\\\nfailed, millions of hard-working Americans would have had their \\\\nfinancial security pulled out from under them.\\\\n    Thankfully, congressional Democrats took action. I was \\\\nproud to vote for the American Rescue Plan, legislation which \\\\nsaved pension plans in danger of collapse. Every single one of \\\\nmy colleagues across the aisle voted against this vital \\\\nlegislation. We have heard a lot about Central States from them \\\\ntoday, but they are focusing only on one part of it.\\\\n    Let us talk about Central States itself. We are talking \\\\nabout a plan with over 357,000 participants, including 11,700 \\\\nin North Carolina, the State where I reside, and over 1,000 \\\\nparticipating businesses. It was projected to run out of money \\\\nin 2025. Can you talk about Central States, and about how \\\\nimportant the plan is to the system no matter how far it \\\\nreaches?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. It is enormous. I would say, you know, in \\\\nresponding to Congressman Scott&#x27;s question. He asked me how \\\\nmany employers are there? There is 3,000. I think over a 1,000 \\\\nof those are in Central States alone. There are a lot of \\\\nemployers, including UPS, and a lot of different companies that \\\\nuse trucking services.\\\\n    They would and we have looked at what states do the \\\\nretirees reside? It is actually across the country. I mean \\\\nthat, you know, those 357,000 people, they retire, they are all \\\\nover the place, so it would have impacted communities all \\\\nacross the country, as well as those thousands of employers.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. I imagine the Central States&#x27; failure was not \\\\nhelpful--potential failure, or looming failure, was not helpful \\\\nin terms of PBGC&#x27;s overall financial position. Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. That is an understatement.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Okay. I am sure you and your team have dealt \\\\nextensively with Central States over the years. Can you talk \\\\nabout the peace of mind that everybody must now feel now that \\\\ntheir plan has been saved?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I would say to all of the \\\\nparticipants in the Central States plan, I think they all can \\\\nrest assured that they, you know, thanks to this, the ARP \\\\nprogram, the SFA program, their plan is solvent, at least \\\\nthrough 2051, and it depends on how things go, and they manage \\\\nthings, but perhaps even further.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Hopefully there will be other people sitting \\\\nin these seats dealing with that issue in 2051. I just wanted \\\\nto bring a broader picture to the Central States discussion, \\\\nand I am thankful that President Biden and congressional \\\\nDemocrats acted to save Central States, and other plans. Are \\\\nthere other steps that we should be considering to protect \\\\nagainst the kind of crisis that Central States experienced?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. There are. The way to look at it is that \\\\nyou know, this is a rescue program that takes us through the \\\\nend of 2051. After that, there is certain reforms that could be \\\\nmade that would make the system more stable. You could look \\\\nat--you could look at funding, you could look at the guaranty, \\\\nyou could look at premiums.\\\\n    There are a lot of different levers that you could look at, \\\\nand we would be happy to work with Congress to come up with \\\\nideas that would extend the theoretical solvency of the entire \\\\nsystem way beyond.\\\\n    Ms. Manning. Thank you. With that, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Ms. Manning. With that, I \\\\nrecognize myself for 5 minutes. I would like to take a few \\\\nmoments in our final question time here, Mr. Director, to focus \\\\non the stewardship of taxpayer resources, and the service that \\\\nis provided to those we are obligated to serve, and of course, \\\\nthis should be a primary concern for every government agency \\\\nand department.\\\\n    The White House tasked all agencies to begin scaling back \\\\ntelework policies after they, the White House, finally \\\\nrecognized the pandemic was over. I would note that my office \\\\nnever instituted telework policies, not in D.C., not in our \\\\nDistrict, but in the President&#x27;s State of the Union address in \\\\nMarch 22, 2 years ago, he pled to the vast majority of \\\\nFederal workers will once again work in person.\\\\n    In April of last year OMB ended maximum telework policies \\\\nand sent further instructions for agencies to develop plans to \\\\nincrease in person work. Approximately how many employees do \\\\nyou have?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. We in our headquarters, we have got about \\\\n1,000 Federal employees, and about 800 contractors.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Okay. Those 1,000 Federal employees, how \\\\nmany of those employees, or what percentage would you say have \\\\nagreements to work remotely?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I would say the vast majority of them do. \\\\nActually, let me correct that. Remotely is completely wrong, I \\\\nthought you meant telework. Remotely it is a small percentage.\\\\n    Chairman Good. All right. Telework?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Telework--it is the majority of them.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Why would they work telework instead of \\\\ncoming in the office?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Why would they want to telework?\\\\n    Chairman Good. Well, why would they--why would we have them \\\\ndo that? Why are they not coming to the office?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, I think during the pandemic we went \\\\nthrough a couple years where----\\\\n    Chairman Good. That has been gone for a few years, so why \\\\nwould they be teleworking today?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. We--No. 1 reason in the last year, in \\\\n2023, we actually moved our headquarters, so we moved into more \\\\nexpensive real eState on 1200 K Street to less expensive, and \\\\nas we have moved we settled into a new building, there have \\\\nbeen some growing pains in the new building, and having \\\\nflexibility has allowed us to get some of the kinks out of it.\\\\n    Chairman Good. At 1,000 employees you would say virtually \\\\nall of them, or almost all of them, or what number telework \\\\nversus coming into the office every day?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Well, all of them come into the--virtually \\\\nall of them come into the office sometime.\\\\n    Chairman Good. What does that mean? Sometime?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Meaning they have different telework \\\\nrequirements. Some of them come in 4 days a week, some of them \\\\n3 days a week.\\\\n    Chairman Good. How many will you say come in 4 days a week \\\\nout of 1,000? Is that true that a significant number come in 4 \\\\ndays a week instead of five?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I would say that is a small percentage.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Okay. What percentage come in maybe just 1 \\\\nday a week, or not at all?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I would say probably a larger percentage \\\\nare coming in but doing more telework.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Okay. We still have most employees not \\\\ncoming in to work enough in the office. How about yourself? How \\\\noften do you come into the office to work physically in the \\\\noffice?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I am in the office on average every other \\\\nweek.\\\\n    Chairman Good. I am sorry?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I guess, 5 days out of every ten.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Half the time you come into work.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Half the time.\\\\n    Chairman Good. The Office of the Advocate&#x27;s annual report \\\\ngives a concerning review of the customer service you provide, \\\\nor do not provide, to plan sponsors. The report says plan \\\\nsponsor complaints consistently involve repeat long-standing \\\\nissues, such as case review delays, absence of oversight and \\\\nmanagement, communication lapse, departmental coordination \\\\nissues, and overall lack of transparency by the Agency&#x27;s \\\\nprocesses and procedures.\\\\n    Could this be at all related to telework policies, which \\\\nare no longer justified, certainly from a virus standpoint?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. I think you have to look at where the plan \\\\nsponsor&#x27;s advocate is coming from. This is our interaction with \\\\nplan sponsors during events like bankruptcies or distrust \\\\nterminations, and these are times when they are looking for the \\\\nPBGC to assume the liabilities of an----\\\\n    Chairman Good. I am going to interrupt you for a second and \\\\nclaim the time just because I only got a minute left, but \\\\nsuggest that we can do a better job of servicing those we are \\\\nresponsible to serve without having our whole team come into \\\\nwork every day I think is questionable.\\\\n    The last thing I just want to ask you. Open Books reported \\\\nback in October that during your time at PBGC you spent 14 \\\\nmillion dollars on new furniture for 1,000 employees, which is \\\\n$14,000.00 per employee, 14 million dollars for new furniture \\\\nfor 1,000 employees, most of which who do not come to work, \\\\nphysically anyway, so they do not need furniture at the office, \\\\npresumably.\\\\n    That is $14,000.00 per employee. I mean $1,400.00 per \\\\nemployee might be understandable if they were all coming to \\\\nwork, $14,000.00 for employee. Can this expense be justified?\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. That number is a little bit misleading. At \\\\nour headquarters, we&#x27;ve got as I said, 1,000 employees and 800 \\\\ncontractors. If you divide by 800 instead of 1,000, or 1,800 \\\\ninstead of 1,000.\\\\n    Chairman Good. That would make it like $8,000.00 per \\\\nemployee.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. It is actually, the number is closer to \\\\n$7,400.00 per employee, which is----\\\\n    Chairman Good. Most of whom do not come into the office.\\\\n    Mr. Hartogensis. Less than the average government baseline \\\\nbenchmark is around $9,000.00, so we were below the benchmark. \\\\nI want to make one other point is that that furniture purchase \\\\nwas not a redecoration, we moved. We actually moved from an old \\\\nheadquarters to a new headquarters.\\\\n    In that move we saved 3 million dollars a year on rent, \\\\nwhich over a 15 year lease is 45 million dollars.\\\\n    Chairman Good. My time is expired, so with respect for the \\\\nCommittee I need to go ahead and thank you for your comments, \\\\nand now we will go to our Ranking Member for his closing \\\\nremarks.\\\\n    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you again, \\\\nDirector, and to all your staff for an excellent, excellent \\\\npresentation today, and a great job. Just if anybody&#x27;s \\\\nwatching, if they are wondering the Director&#x27;s background, no \\\\none would accuse you of being a socialist if I, as I have been \\\\naccused of being a socialist. In addition to who nominated you, \\\\nand who confirmed you, you got a bachelor&#x27;s degree from \\\\nStanford in computer science. You have got a master&#x27;s degree in \\\\ntechnology and management from Columbia University, and you \\\\nwent out and started businesses in the tech field.\\\\n    If anyone is watching, that is who the director is, and I \\\\nappreciate your problem solving, your intellect, and your \\\\nhonesty here today. It shows that we can get things done when \\\\nwe have divergent party affiliations and ideology. If we work \\\\nto the common good of what how do we solve difficult problems?\\\\n    Obviously, in a difficult situation, remind people that \\\\nthis is the recent, the last 4 years were all part of an \\\\ninternational pandemic. You went in, in this instance, and \\\\nsolved something with the Biden administration with us that was \\\\nlacking a solution prior to an international pandemic.\\\\n    Last, just on the conversations with real people. I mean we \\\\ntend to forget about this here in Washington. The real people \\\\nwho would have suffered if you had not done what you did. We \\\\nhave talked about that. President Biden and congressional \\\\nDemocrats recognize the urgency and magnitude of the \\\\nmultiemployer pension crisis, and took as I said, historic \\\\naction in the American Rescue Plan Act to solve it.\\\\n    Even though many of their constituents would be harmed if \\\\nplans failed, and the system collapsed, not a single Republican \\\\ncolleague voted for that legislation. The Pension Benefit \\\\nGuaranty Corporation quickly and effectively implemented the \\\\nSpecial Financial Assistance Program and took steps to improve \\\\nits administration.\\\\n    So far, the PBGC has approved SFA applications from 71 \\\\nplans, saving over 770,000 pensions and protecting 3,000 \\\\nbusinesses to date. There is more to come. As I have said \\\\nmultiple times today, there are real people, real Americans, \\\\nbehind the pensions we have saved.\\\\n    Kenneth Lee Edmundson wrote to the Joint Select Committee \\\\non Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans that, quote, from \\\\nMr. Edmundson, ``The loss of my pension would force my wife and \\\\nI to sell our house. Along with this expense, and our medical \\\\nbills over and above what our health insurance covers. I have \\\\nto take medications to prevent a stroke from a blot clot, and \\\\nalso medication to control heart rhythm.\\\\n    I worked many long hours for 32 years and drove in all \\\\ntypes of weather and road conditions, sacrificing time away \\\\nfrom my family. Thinking it would be worth it because of the \\\\npension income I would receive on my retirement. If I lost my \\\\npension, it would be devastating, just trying to survive \\\\nextremely conservatively would be impossible.\\\\n    Are we going to be put in a situation deciding between \\\\ngroceries and medications? We are innocent victims of all this, \\\\nwe just want what we earned.&#x27;&#x27; End quote.\\\\n    Again, I want to thank you all. You are not bureaucrats; \\\\nyou are public servants. I am grateful for your service and \\\\nthank you for what you accomplished. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Good. Thank you, Ranking Member. Mr. Hartogensis, \\\\nthank you. I recognize myself for closing remarks. Thanks for \\\\ntaking the time again to appear before the Committee and answer \\\\nour questions. Unfortunately, I remain convinced that the PBGC \\\\nis the poster child for bureaucratic incompetence and gross \\\\nmismanagement of taxpayer dollars.\\\\n    It is clear that PBGC needs to crack down the way on the \\\\nway it administers the Special Financial Assistance Fund to \\\\nensure that there are not any other million dollar mishaps, or \\\\nbillion dollar interest rate blunders. Ten years ago, Congress \\\\ncreated the Office of the Advocate to scrutinize PBGC \\\\npractices, and be a liaison for plan sponsors.\\\\n    The Office of the Advocate has offered dozens of \\\\nrecommendations over the years to improve services and \\\\nmanagement. After a decade of watching recommendations go \\\\nunnoticed, this year&#x27;s annual report reiterated the need for a \\\\nchange in leadership. The report recommends the creation of a \\\\nCEO position to provide daily oversight and management of \\\\nPBGC&#x27;s senior leaders.\\\\n    This is something I believe Congress should take seriously, \\\\nas we look for legislative solutions following this hearing. We \\\\nneed to ensure that PBGC never needs a taxpayer bailout again. \\\\nWe need to ensure all government employees are showing up to \\\\nwork and providing excellent services to Americans. We need to \\\\nassure that those in leadership are committed to following the \\\\nletter of the law. We need to adjust premium rates to \\\\naccurately reflect the risk associated with pension plans.\\\\n    I think your Agency certainly has its work cut out for it, \\\\nand this Committee is certainly going to do its job, and be \\\\nwatching this very closely. Again, we thank you for your time, \\\\nand without objection, there being no further business, the \\\\nCommittee stands adjourned.\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 11:35 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73168/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"03/28/2023\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"PRESIDENT BIDEN'S FISCAL YEAR 2024 BUDGET REQUEST WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY BECERRA\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73168, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"Ways and Means\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                      HEARING ON PRESIDENT BIDEN&#x27;S\\\\n                  FISCAL YEAR 2024 BUDGET REQUEST WITH\\\\n                       HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\\\n                           SECRETARY BECERRA\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n                                HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                      COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS\\\\n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             FIRST SESSION\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                             MARCH 28, 2023\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                          Serial No. 118-FC06\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n         Printed for the use of the Committee on Ways and Means\\\\n         \\\\n\\\\n                  [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n                                    \\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE\\\\n                    \\\\n55-032                     WASHINGTON : 2024                     \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                      COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS\\\\n\\\\n                    JASON SMITH, Missouri, Chairman\\\\nVERN BUCHANAN, Florida               RICHARD E.

Jason T. Smith, \\\\n[chairman of the committee] presiding.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The committee will come to order.\\\\n    Thank you, Secretary Becerra, for testifying today before \\\\nthe House Ways and Means Committee.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s 2024 budget doubles down on harmful \\\\npolicies that will only make access and affordability of care \\\\nworse, killing new medical innovation, false promises of \\\\nMedicare solvency with real consequences, and more reckless \\\\nspending on government subsidies for the wealthy.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s new budget expands Democrats&#x27; harmful drug \\\\nprice control, which means higher prices for new medicines, \\\\naccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\\\\n    Regular folks will have less access to care and fewer new \\\\ndrugs, up to 342 fewer, according to one study, with medical \\\\nresearchers already announcing suspending work on treatments \\\\nfor eye disease and certain blood cancers.\\\\n    On top of fewer and more expensive medicines for seniors, \\\\nPresident Biden&#x27;s budget also cuts Medicare. For example, under \\\\ncurrent law Medicare faces 500 billion in cuts created solely \\\\nby Democrats&#x27; spending spree. The President&#x27;s new budget \\\\npresents no plan to stop them and threatens seniors&#x27; hard-\\\\nearned benefits.\\\\n    It also proposed significant changes to Medicare Advantage, \\\\nwhich may negatively impact the 31 million Americans who rely \\\\non the program. These seniors who prefer Medicare Advantage \\\\nplans need assurance from the Administration that their cost, \\\\ncoverage, and access to care will not be impacted.\\\\n    Republicans are committed to protecting and strengthening \\\\nMedicare, which is why last week all of the Republicans on Ways \\\\nand Means and Energy and Commerce sent you a letter about this \\\\nissue, and we look forward to your detailed response.\\\\n    Additionally, this budget continues welfare for the wealthy \\\\nby proposing another $183 billion in new Obamacare subsidies \\\\nfor wealthy people making as much as $600,000 a year.\\\\n    These Washington subsidies are a cause of inflation, not a \\\\nsolution. I represent rural, working-class communities where \\\\naccess to health care is a major challenge. Health clinics and \\\\nhospitals are struggling to keep their doors open to treat \\\\npatients.\\\\n    The Biden Administration must prioritize better access to \\\\ncare for rural Americans.\\\\n    Thanks to the President&#x27;s policy failures, our economy is \\\\nstill struggling, and his refusal to change direction will only \\\\nfurther undermine Medicare and Social Security. In fact, a \\\\nUniversity of Chicago analysis shows the Presidents&#x27; low-growth \\\\npolicies will reduce Medicare and Social Security financing by \\\\nnearly $900 billion, another direct threat to seniors&#x27; health \\\\nand retirement at the hands of this Administration.\\\\n    This budget rehashes the same mistakes of more government \\\\nprice controls, false promises to seniors, and billions more in \\\\nsubsidies that drive health care inflation.\\\\n    House Republicans want to lower cost for working families, \\\\nimprove access to quality care, and protect Medicare. The Biden \\\\nAdministration should work with us to achieve these goals.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. I am pleased to recognize the gentleman \\\\nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Neal, for his opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. NEAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    We want to welcome back to the Committee on Ways and Means \\\\nthe distinguished alum, another success story that comes from \\\\nthe Ways and Means Committee.\\\\n    It is an honor to have you here, Mr. Secretary. When you \\\\ntestified before us last year, our country was in the midst of \\\\nan unprecedented economic recovery from the financial impacts \\\\nof COVID-19.\\\\n    Today that progress continues, two years of consecutive \\\\neconomic growth, wages rising, and the strongest jobs record of \\\\nany administration in history. And we have accomplished all of \\\\nthis while our colleagues on the other side have reported the \\\\nidea that somehow we are in a recession, launching partisan \\\\nattacks.\\\\n    We are raising the first generation of Americans that only \\\\nknow life with the Affordable Care Act. What a story this has \\\\nturned out to be, and now it is baked into the American \\\\neconomy. At life&#x27;s most vulnerable moments they do not have to \\\\nfear any longer that their insurance company will cut off their \\\\ncoverage or be denied coverage because of cost or preexisting \\\\nconditions.\\\\n    They only know health coverage is free from discrimination \\\\nfor those with preexisting conditions and women.\\\\n    In the last 13 years, we have given Americans peace of \\\\nmind, and we are not going back. Democrats have supercharged \\\\nthe ACA over the last decade, lowering health care costs, \\\\nreducing prescription drug prices for millions with the \\\\nAmerican Rescue Package and the Inflation Reduction Act.\\\\n    Republicans, on the other side, have repeatedly attempted \\\\nto repeal without a replacement opportunity to the ACA.\\\\n    President Biden&#x27;s fiscal 2024 budget shares the Ways and \\\\nMeans Committee Democrats&#x27; commitment to building on historic \\\\nprogress that the last Congress made. This budget responsibly \\\\ninvests in affordability and accessibility of care, giving \\\\nAmericans more breathing room while reducing the deficit.\\\\n    Simply put, this budget puts workers and families over the \\\\nwell-connected.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, we hope that during this afternoon&#x27;s \\\\nopportunity, Republicans might unveil what their budget really \\\\nlooks like. We eagerly await that opportunity.\\\\n    This is how you build an economy from the middle out and \\\\nthe bottom up, further expanding Medicare&#x27;s ability to \\\\nnegotiate drug prices, permanently extending premium tax \\\\ncredits, strengthening Medicare, improving its services, \\\\nbuilding on the American Rescue Plan&#x27;s investments in \\\\nchildcare, and addressing America&#x27;s mental health crisis, and \\\\nclosing our coverage gaps for Americans living in States that \\\\nhave not expanded it.\\\\n    Other Ways and Means priorities included in the President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget are, investments in elder care and TANF emergency funds. \\\\nWe will protect our most vulnerable citizens. Democrats know \\\\nthat investing in health care and care of giving is an \\\\ninvestment in our Nation&#x27;s children, families, and economy.\\\\n    Many on the other side have attempted to send this health \\\\ncare system back to the grim days when tens of millions of \\\\nAmericans were without health insurance. That plot to repeal \\\\nthe ACA or the Inflation Reduction Act, while making deep cuts \\\\nto Medicaid, would devastate millions.\\\\n    Their plan pulls from the same unsuccessful playbook that \\\\nthey have been pushing for the last 13 years, shifting costs \\\\nonto patients, sending the health care system into chaos, and \\\\ntaking away protections relating to preexisting conditions.\\\\n    Our colleagues have made it clear where they stand, and let \\\\nme tell you it is not with the American family if the companies \\\\nwho will profit hand over hand and fist over fist from \\\\nlifesaving medications and the top one percent continue to get \\\\nbillions of dollars in tax cuts in exchange for health care \\\\ncoverage.\\\\n    Ways and Means Democrats have stayed the course, \\\\nstrengthening Americans&#x27; health care even as that coverage has \\\\nbeen threatened to be taken away by the other side. Countless \\\\nlives have been saved.\\\\n    In my opening statement I have used the opportunity to \\\\nremind all of the success of the ACA, the success of Medicare, \\\\nthe success of Social Security, and just as importantly, a \\\\nreminder that Medicaid has now become, as we have discussed in \\\\nthe past, a very important part of planning for long-term care \\\\nfor the American family. Fifty-seven cents on every Medicaid \\\\ndollar now goes to long-term care.\\\\n    As you know, Mr. Secretary, we are delighted to have you \\\\nhere on the topics on which we agree, I am also going to use my \\\\nquestion-and-answer period to talk about what this committee \\\\ndid of historic purpose with the whole idea of surprise \\\\nbilling.\\\\n    Mr. Brady and I fully were on the same page. We know \\\\nexactly what we intended with the wording choice, and I hope \\\\nthat based on the conversations we have had and the court \\\\ndecisions that have been rendered that we will be able to \\\\ntravel down that path in the next few hours.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your presence.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH [continuing]. Thank you, Ranking Member \\\\nNeal.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s sole witness, former Ways and Means colleague and \\\\nis the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \\\\nServices, Xavier Becerra.\\\\n    The committee has received your written statement, and it \\\\nwill be made part of the formal hearing record.\\\\n    You have five minutes to deliver your oral remarks. \\\\nSecretary Becerra, you may begin when you are ready.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF THE HON. XAVIER BECERRA, SECRETARY OF THE U.S. \\\\n            DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\\\n\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Mr. Chairman, Chairman Smith, Ranking \\\\nMember Neal, to all the members, thank you very much for the \\\\ninvitation. Great to be back in the room. I see my chair \\\\nsomewhere around there.\\\\n    A lot of things have happened in the year since I last \\\\nspoke to you about budgets. More than 16 million Americans have \\\\nsecured health insurance through the Affordable Care Act \\\\nmarketplaces. That is an all-time high, to emphasize what \\\\nCongressman Neal had mentioned.\\\\n    All together more than 300 million Americans now carry \\\\ninsurance to cover their health care. That is another historic \\\\nhigh.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s new lower cost prescription drug law has \\\\ncapped insulin at $35 per month and made preventative vaccines \\\\nlike flu, COVID, shingles available for free under Medicare.\\\\n    Moving forward, this new law gives us the right to finally \\\\nnegotiate for lower prescription drug prices for Americans.\\\\n    To cap it all off, the Biden-Harris Administration has \\\\nsafely and effectively executed the largest adult vaccination \\\\nprogram in U.S. history, achieving nearly 700 million shots in \\\\narms during the COVID pandemic without charge.\\\\n    The fiscal year 2024 budget proposes $144 billion in \\\\ndiscretionary funding and $1.7 trillion in mandatory funding \\\\nfor HHS. It positions us to tackle the urgent challenges we \\\\nface, including a growing behavioral health crisis and future \\\\npublic health threats.\\\\n    It also funds operations and mission critical \\\\ninfrastructure needed to build a healthier America, moving the \\\\nNation from an illness care system to a wellness care system.\\\\n    An illness care system leaves our most vulnerable families \\\\nbehind. A wellness care system invests in providing the full \\\\nspectrum of health care to all Americans.\\\\n    Illness care allows the price of prescription drugs to \\\\nskyrocket. Wellness care starts by prescribing fruits, \\\\nvegetables, and exercise. It treats food as medicine.\\\\n    Illness care requires you to get a referral by your family \\\\nphysician to see a specialist for mental health services. \\\\nWellness care, well, it lets you get mental health care the \\\\nminute you walk through the door of your family physician&#x27;s \\\\noffice.\\\\n    Illness care forces hardworking Americans to deplete their \\\\nlife savings to get that long-term care that they need, and \\\\nthis is the point that Mr. Neal was stressing. Wellness care \\\\nwill invest nearly as much as it can and as early as possible \\\\nin long-term care, like in-home care, so our older adults and \\\\nAmericans with disabilities can thrive at home and in their \\\\ncommunities.\\\\n    Our budget invests in wellness care. We invest more than \\\\n$30 billion to prepare for the next COVID or public health \\\\ncrisis, including $1 billion to replenish our Nation&#x27;s \\\\nstrategic national stockpile.\\\\n    On behavioral health, too many of our loved ones are dying \\\\nfrom suicide and overdose. So we increase access to crisis \\\\ncare. We grow the behavioral health workforce and we beef up \\\\nsubstance use services.\\\\n    We are also gearing up to handle more than six million \\\\nadditional contacts from the people who are experiencing a \\\\nmental health crisis through 988, the three-digit suicide \\\\nprevention lifeline we stood up last year.\\\\n    This budget covers two million adults left out of Medicaid \\\\nby their home State and extends tax credits that make health \\\\ncare more affordable for millions of Americans.\\\\n    It would also ensure that expanded postpartum Medicaid \\\\ncoverage for a new mom and her baby is here to stay.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s budget not only strengthens Medicare for \\\\ntoday&#x27;s seniors but protects and strengthens it for the next \\\\ngeneration.\\\\n    We also take care of our family members in this budget, \\\\ninvesting $600 billion in childcare and preschool programs and \\\\n$150 billion to strengthen Medicaid home and community-based \\\\nservices. This budget funds the Cancer Moonshot and APRA-H and \\\\ninvests in Title 10 family planning programs essential to so \\\\nmany of our families.\\\\n    It delivers on our commitments made as part of the National \\\\nStrategy for Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. It opens more \\\\ncommunity health centers.\\\\n    And important to me as the former Attorney General, it \\\\nbolsters our health care fraud and abuse detection and \\\\nenforcement work.\\\\n    And of course, the President&#x27;s budget honors our \\\\nresponsibilities to Indian Country with more than $2 billion in \\\\nnew resources in 2024.\\\\n    This budget reflects the President&#x27;s and our values and \\\\ncommitments. It helps begin the move from a Nation focused on \\\\nillness care to one about wellness care, and most importantly, \\\\nit ensures health and wellness are within the reach for all \\\\nAmericans.\\\\n    On behalf of the women and men of HHS, we look forward to \\\\nworking with you and, Mr. Chairman, we thank you for the time.\\\\n    And I yield back.\\\\n    [The statement of Secretary Becerra follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Secretary.\\\\n    As always, we want to make sure that all members have an \\\\nopportunity to ask questions of the Secretary. Therefore, \\\\nwithout objection, each member will be recognized for three and \\\\na half minutes to accommodate the Secretary&#x27;s time.\\\\n    We will now proceed to the question-and-answer session, and \\\\nI will begin.\\\\n    In the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats gave your \\\\ndepartment $3 billion to implement a drug price setting scheme \\\\nwhich will undermine innovation into lifesaving drugs and \\\\nincrease the cost of new medication.\\\\n    I, along with the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance \\\\nCommittee, Senator Crapo, as well as House Energy and Commerce \\\\nChair, Cathy McMorris Rogers, have requested detailed \\\\ninformation on how your department plans to spend the $3 \\\\nbillion.\\\\n    That was sent to you more than a month ago, and we only \\\\nreceived your response just mere minutes before the hearing \\\\nbegan today.\\\\n    Will you commit to keeping Ways and Means regularly \\\\ninformed by making appropriate HHS officials available to \\\\ntestify before this committee about the drug pricing scheme so \\\\nthat we can have more effective oversight over what I fear will \\\\nbe more government expansion and control?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Mr. Chairman, we are absolutely \\\\ncommitted to making sure that in implementation of this new \\\\nprescription drug law that allows us to negotiate for better \\\\nprices and increase competition, that we will absolutely keep \\\\nthis committee informed.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Secretary.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s budget claims to add 25 years of solvency \\\\nto the Medicare Program, but it is all just budgetary sleight \\\\nof hand.\\\\n    The President&#x27;s budget does have $650 billion in new taxes \\\\non small businesses, but then you use that money to claim both \\\\nshoring up Medicare&#x27;s Trust Fund and deficit reduction.\\\\n    You are putting budget gimmicks over beneficiaries. The \\\\nlast time you claimed savings in Medicare through the Inflation \\\\nReduction Act&#x27;s drug price setting program, you used that $300 \\\\nbillion in savings to pay for green new deal policies, such as \\\\ngreen vehicle tax credits.\\\\n    How can you assure the new revenue will be used for \\\\nMedicare solvency when your own budget also claims these same \\\\ntax increases will be used for deficit reduction?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Mr. Chairman, what I can tell you is \\\\nthat the President is committed to make sure that he not only \\\\nextends Medicare into the next generation, but he does it by \\\\nprotecting the benefits that curb Medicare beneficiaries&#x27; \\\\nreceipt.\\\\n    And the beauty of this is that because he does it in a way \\\\nthat does not hurt middle income Americans, we can make sure \\\\nthat as you continue to work, you are going to be ready to \\\\nreceive your Medicare ready and fully there to go for you.\\\\n    And so what I can say to you is that the President is the \\\\nfirst President I know, and I sat at that dais for over 20 \\\\nyears, the first President who has actually proposed a real \\\\nplan to deal with Medicare to keep it strong for the years to \\\\ncome.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. So that leads to my next question because \\\\nhe did not address this issue in regards to Medicare.\\\\n    During the Biden Administration&#x27;s first two years, we have \\\\nseen near $2 trillion in unpaid for, reckless Democrat \\\\nspending, and according to pay-go law, this will result in more \\\\nthan $500 billion in cuts to Medicare over the next decade.\\\\n    To the detriment of seniors, your budget shows no plan to \\\\nreverse these cuts. You simply ignore them and try to sweep \\\\nthem under the rug as if they are not happening.\\\\n    Why do you not account for these looming cuts in your \\\\nbudget?\\\\n    And what are you going to do to prevent them from taking \\\\nplace?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Mr. Chairman, we can try to go through \\\\nthe numbers, but what I can tell you is that the President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget actually reduces the deficit in the years to come, and \\\\nwhat it does for Medicare is it preserves those benefits that \\\\nwe have become accustomed to seeing available to our family \\\\nmembers, our parents, and our grandparents.\\\\n    And what I will tell you is this. The President made sure \\\\nthat he proposed a budget that not only would strengthen \\\\nMedicare for the next generation, but at the same time--and the \\\\nbudget numbers show it--would be able to reduce the deficit \\\\nlong term by substantial numbers into the hundreds of billions, \\\\nif not trillions.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. But the budget does not say anything about \\\\nthe $500 billion in looming cuts from pay-go. Do you have \\\\nanywhere in the budget that you would show that the President \\\\nis going to make sure those cuts do not take an effect?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So I will try to stay in my lane and \\\\nspeak to HHS budget elements and say to you that within \\\\nMedicare, I can speak to you unequivocally that this budget \\\\nprotects every single benefit that the Medicare laws provide to \\\\nseniors and those who are disabled.\\\\n    And it does so by making sure that moving forward into the \\\\nnext generation those very benefits are there for them as well.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Last Tuesday you received a letter from \\\\nmyself and all the Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee \\\\nand Energy and Commerce Committee asking specific questions \\\\nabout proposed changes your department wants to make to the \\\\nMedicare Advantage Program.\\\\n    Your department is claiming a one percent increase in \\\\nMedicare Advantage payments for 2024. This calculation includes \\\\nwhat is called the ``risk score trend,&#x27;&#x27; basically a metric \\\\nthat is supposed to project insurance plans&#x27; coding behavior \\\\nthroughout the year of care for their beneficiaries.\\\\n    Do you agree that the risk score trend, of which CMS \\\\nprojects to be three percent for 2024, is a forward-looking \\\\nmetric and is not factored into a plan&#x27;s base payment?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Mr. Chairman, today, after some 30 \\\\nyears, almost 30 years of managed care within the Medicare \\\\nsystem, we have data that helps us be able to project forward, \\\\nand the projections that we are making are based on data.\\\\n    And that data is showing us that in many cases that we have \\\\nbeen overpaying those insurance companies that are within the \\\\nMedicare system. We are simply trying to make sure that we keep \\\\nmoney in Medicare for Medicare beneficiaries.\\\\n    And no one, whether it is an insurance company or a \\\\nprovider, should make unreasonable profits at the expense of \\\\nMedicare beneficiaries.\\\\n    And so we are just trying to make sure that we now use the \\\\ndata, the evidence that we have, to make sure that we move \\\\nforward in the Medicare Program, whether it is the fee-for-\\\\nservice program or the managed care program.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. It is my understanding that this is a \\\\nprojected metric.\\\\n    Do you agree that your own agency, CMS, approves Medicare \\\\nAdvantage insurers&#x27; bids, excluding this risk score trend?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Let me ask the question again. Now you \\\\nare asking me to get into CMS&#x27; business. So I want to make sure \\\\nI am----\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Yes. Do you agree that your own agency, \\\\nCMS, approves Medicare Advantage insurers&#x27; bids, excluding this \\\\nrisk score trend?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So I will try to answer the best I can \\\\nand certainly ask our Administrator to respond more directly \\\\nand precisely.\\\\n    But we make sure that we follow both the statutory \\\\nprescriptions that we have and all the regulations that are in \\\\nplace for the managed care program within Medicare when it \\\\ncomes to how we put out the reimbursement rates for those \\\\ninsurance companies.\\\\n    And what we are finding is, of course, that we are \\\\noverpaying in many cases, and now we are trying to make sure we \\\\nget some of that money back. It is in the billions.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. It is my understanding that CMS excludes \\\\nthis in their evaluations. So excluding this risk score trend, \\\\nMedicare Advantage insurers will have to set their premiums \\\\nbased on an expected two percent decrease in payments compared \\\\nwith last year, correct?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We, in our plan, we do not require \\\\nMedicare Advantage plans to cut any Medicare services that are \\\\nprovided within the confines of the law of Medicare.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. So, Mr. Secretary, it is basic math. One \\\\nminus three is a negative number. We have heard from many \\\\nconcerned groups that this proposal may lead Medicare Advantage \\\\ninsurers to increase premiums or decrease certain benefits, \\\\npotentially impacting seniors and their access to care.\\\\n    I urge you to provide a diligent response to our questions \\\\nthat we sent you.\\\\n    One last thing. HHS, under President Trump, established a \\\\nhospital price transparency rule that went into effect on \\\\nJanuary 1st, 2021, requiring hospitals to post publicly the \\\\ncost of various medical services they provide.\\\\n    Unfortunately, there are major concerns regarding \\\\nhospitals&#x27; compliance with the rule and whether the data is \\\\ntruly helpful for patients.\\\\n    What is the Biden Administration doing to ensure hospitals \\\\nare abiding with not just the letter but the intent of that \\\\nrule so that patients have greater transparency and insight \\\\ninto the cost of the procedures before they receive care?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Excellent question, Mr. Chairman. \\\\nBecause we are trying to make sure that we move forward that \\\\nnew law, I think there are still some 30 percent of providers \\\\nwho have not yet complied. We are trying to move quickly.\\\\n    Part of it we have to recognize that these providers have \\\\nnever had to do that. All of them use different formulas to \\\\nfigure out what their cost structure would be. We are trying to \\\\nget all of them to become more uniform, but that does not \\\\nexcuse for them not complying with the law.\\\\n    And so we are trying to be more aggressive in how we get \\\\nthem there. Hopefully it is with a carrot, but we have got the \\\\nstick as well that you all provided us, and we will definitely \\\\ntry to do that.\\\\n    I look to you for some guidance as well because we want to \\\\nmake sure that as we get all these providers to be transparent \\\\nin their pricing, we do it without hurting the little guys who \\\\ndo not have the kind of wherewithal that the big guys do to \\\\nreally get in that stream of things.\\\\n    And, by the way, on Medicare managed care program, Medicare \\\\nAdvantage, so-called Medicare Advantage, Mr. Chairman, our \\\\nproposal increases the amount of money that those insurance \\\\ncompanies will get from last year. How anyone can claim that \\\\nthere is going to be a cut I do not understand.\\\\n    The second thing is there is nothing that we are doing that \\\\nwould require any insurance company to cut any benefits to any \\\\nAmerican on Medicare. If they make those cuts, it is those \\\\ninsurance companies that are doing it, and it is on them, not \\\\non the laws or what we have done at CMS.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. It is just a huge concern for 31 million \\\\nAmericans, and we are very concerned.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Because it should be.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Because many of these Americans are worried \\\\nthat they are going to have cuts, and the way that we add it \\\\nup, it appears that there is going to be a minus 2 percent cut.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We have these deceptive commercials that \\\\nare on TV. I think it is unfair.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. We need to--yes. Well, this will not be the \\\\nlast we discuss this topic.\\\\n    Thank you, Secretary.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Thank you, Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. I recognize the gentleman from \\\\nMassachusetts, Mr. Neal.\\\\n    Mr. NEAL. Thank you.\\\\n    Under President Biden and with your department&#x27;s \\\\nleadership, Mr. Secretary, we have seen an increase in the \\\\nnumber of Americans with insurance coverage and a reduction in \\\\nout-of-pocket costs and lowering insurance and drug costs due \\\\nto both strengthening and the growth of the Affordable Care \\\\nAct.\\\\n    Our legislative agenda on the Democratic side, including \\\\nthe Inflation Reduction Act is prevailing. Today more than 40 \\\\nmillion Americans owe their health coverage to the Affordable \\\\nCare Act. That is how important this law is.\\\\n    Just last week the other side tipped their hand on some of \\\\ntheir health care ideas. More of the same, allowing insurers to \\\\ndiscriminate against patients with preexisting conditions \\\\nincluding diabetes, shifting costs onto patients, and promoting \\\\ntax accounts that benefit the wealthy.\\\\n    All of this instead of bolstering a law that is not only \\\\nwidely popular, but also what consumers want and need. That \\\\nagenda would raise health care costs for families across the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    On average Americans with coverage through exchanges have \\\\nsaved $800 this year, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, \\\\nand the other side would put those savings on the line, as we \\\\nnoted in this committee just recently.\\\\n    We still have not seen a Republican budget plan. They want \\\\nus to get to work in balancing a budget, but they will not show \\\\nus their plan.\\\\n    Make no mistake. Their proposals will have a hard time \\\\nunder the magnifying glass in standing up. They simply will \\\\npunish the sick by making them foot higher bills.\\\\n    If going after workers is not enough, many of these \\\\nphysicians will go after seniors, and one of the first bills to \\\\nrepeal the life-changing drug pricing provisions of the \\\\nInflation Reduction Act, they would remove the power to \\\\nnegotiate drug prices from Medicare, eliminating the cap on \\\\nout-of-pocket costs and insulin.\\\\n    Had the insulin cap been in effect in 2020, more than 1.5 \\\\nmillion Americans would have saved $500 that year, including \\\\nfree vaccines that will save the average American $70 as \\\\nbeneficiaries.\\\\n    I think we can agree they will attack family budgets \\\\nthrough their plans.\\\\n    Finally, Mr. Secretary, let me take a note for a moment, by \\\\nthe way, to congratulate North Carolina on expanding Medicaid \\\\nand the Affordable Care Act, a reminder that every child in \\\\nMassachusetts has health insurance. Ninety-seven percent of the \\\\nadults in Massachusetts have health insurance because of the \\\\nACA, and it polls regularly in the high 70 percentiles.\\\\n    Finally, you and I have spoken a number of times, Mr. \\\\nSecretary, about surprise billing. Mr. Brady and I, the former \\\\nRanking Member, we know precisely what we intended with the \\\\nlanguage and the words that we chose. We have not only \\\\nprevailed in this committee. We have prevailed on the floor of \\\\nthe House, on the floor of the Senate, and now in subsequent \\\\ncourt cases.\\\\n    I hope that these implementation issues will be consistent \\\\nwith what this committee intended, and much of the confusion \\\\nand expense has been a result of a department that is not \\\\nfulfilling the wishes of what the committee intended here on \\\\nthis legislation.\\\\n    We need a commitment to indicate that we will continue to \\\\nexpeditiously air these issues and do precisely what this \\\\ncommittee intended when we marked this legislation up. We saw \\\\nit on both side as a huge accomplishment.\\\\n    And if you might in the last 14 seconds, Mr. Secretary?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes, and I know we will talk about this \\\\nmore, but first I have to say thank you to you, Mr. Brady, and \\\\nmany of your colleagues who pushed this because at the end of \\\\nthe day, we still have work to do to make it work right, to \\\\nyour point.\\\\n    What we can guarantee you is that Americans as consumers of \\\\nthat health care service, as the patients are taken out of the \\\\nfood fight between the provider who gave the care and the \\\\ninsurance company who has to pay it, the most important thing \\\\nyou did was to make sure that as that fight continues, it is \\\\nnot patients who have to pay the price.\\\\n    Mr. NEAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. I recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. \\\\nBuchanan.\\\\n    Mr. BUCHANAN. Welcome back, Mr. Secretary. It is great to \\\\nsee you.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Great to see you.\\\\n    Mr. BUCHANAN. We did work out a lot of things together. So \\\\nI appreciate that.\\\\n    I want to touch base on Alzheimer&#x27;s drugs. I am in Florida. \\\\nI have got the fifth oldest district in the country. So CMS \\\\ndecided they will not cover the Alzheimer&#x27;s drugs.\\\\n    It just seems like every family is touched by this. To give \\\\nsomeone an extra six months to a year even though the drug is \\\\nmaybe not quite where it needs to be is a big deal.\\\\n    But it basically essentially put them out of reach for six \\\\nand half million Americans with Alzheimer&#x27;s. Just two weeks \\\\nago, however, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced they \\\\nwould cover the latest cost for veterans.\\\\n    Sadly, CMS is still blocking access to this. In fact, CMS \\\\nrefused to even consider the decision even though the \\\\nAlzheimer&#x27;s Association is strongly, strongly supporting it. I \\\\nhave met with them.\\\\n    Given the VA decided to cover this drug, will you commit to \\\\nworking with CMS to try to reconsider that decision?\\\\n    Because it is devastating I will tell you now, I think, for \\\\na lot of people across the country, but especially in Florida.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, there is nothing you said \\\\nthat I do not agree with. There is not probably one of us who \\\\nhas not gone through the circumstance where one of our loved \\\\nones, our parents, our grandparents, is going through \\\\nAlzheimer&#x27;s or some form of dementia.\\\\n    I have gone through it. My wife has gone through it. It is \\\\ndevastating, especially if like us you are the one who is \\\\nproviding a lot of that care.\\\\n    And I have said this to the advocates from the Alzheimer&#x27;s \\\\nAssociation. You keep pushing. You are doing everything right.\\\\n    And what I will tell you is that CMS is moving in the \\\\ndirection which I think will give a lot of Americans heart to \\\\nbelieve that their loved one will have an opportunity to get \\\\nrecovery.\\\\n    Mr. BUCHANAN. Let me get another question in at least.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. BUCHANAN. Because we only get three and half minutes.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I apologize.\\\\n    Mr. BUCHANAN. Also I just want to touch base on the year \\\\n2024 in terms of Medicare Advantage. They are looking at a cut, \\\\n2.3 percent. It will negatively impact 31 million people who \\\\nhave got Medicare. It is huge, over 50 percent, 55 percent of \\\\npeople who have Medicare Advantage.\\\\n    And they are looking at raising the price from $540 to \\\\n$830, which is over a 50 percent increase. It is huge because a \\\\nlot of the seniors, that is all they have. It is very \\\\nimportant.\\\\n    Is that something you can consider to look into as well?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So, Congressman, here I want to be \\\\nreally clear. We are not doing any of what you just said. I am \\\\nnot sure where you got that information, but we are increasing \\\\nthe amount of reimbursement we are getting to these insurance \\\\ncompanies.\\\\n    If these insurance companies are claiming that they are \\\\ngoing to have to cut benefits, it is because they do not want \\\\nto provide them and they are more willing to take care of their \\\\nprofits over the----\\\\n    Mr. BUCHANAN. I will get you the information, the backup on \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Please.\\\\n    Mr. BUCHANAN. I read a letter with Chairman Smith \\\\ninterviewing Commerce Chairwoman Rogers and Health Subcommittee \\\\nChairman Guthrie. I would like to submit it for the record, \\\\nasking direct questions about the impact this will have on \\\\nseniors and how CMS determines these rates.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Without objection.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I look forward to getting it.\\\\n    Mr. BUCHANAN. With that I yield back.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Texas is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your service.\\\\n    I think among the many positive provisions in the \\\\nPresident&#x27;s budget are those that are designed to strengthen \\\\nMedicare.\\\\n    It is not enough to say we will not cut Medicare. It is \\\\ntaking the steps necessary to ensure that it is there not just \\\\nfor today&#x27;s grandparents, but for tomorrow&#x27;s grandchildren.\\\\n    And I think further comment from you is in order about \\\\nMedicare Advantage. I remember, as you do because you were on \\\\nthe committee, when people came forward and told us how much \\\\nmoney Medicare Advantage was going to save Medicare.\\\\n    Instead we find it to be one of the most profitable \\\\nsections of the insurance business. I heard the suggestion 31 \\\\nmillion Americans are concerned. I think it is rather a few \\\\nhundred insurance executives that are concerned that getting \\\\n$1,500 on average per Medicare beneficiary paying that much \\\\nmore for Medicare Advantage than for traditional Medicare is \\\\njust not enough for them.\\\\n    MedPAC, an independent agency that looks at these issues, \\\\nhas estimated that we spent about $27 billion in overpayment to \\\\nMedicare Advantage this year alone.\\\\n    I have seen those misleading commercials you referred to, \\\\nand I know our constituents are being bombarded with tales \\\\nabout all that is going to go wrong if the Administration&#x27;s \\\\nproposals are adopted.\\\\n    They are the same folks that get bombarded with one \\\\nmisleading advertisement and phone call after another trying to \\\\nsell them on a policy that may well provide them lack of access \\\\nto their physician at a time when they need it the most.\\\\n    Seeing what you have done to date, is it not correct that \\\\nyou are not cutting Medicare Advantage? You are not really \\\\ngetting back that $27 billion in overpayment. You are actually \\\\nunder your proposal increasing the payments that Medicare \\\\nAdvantage company will get in the next year by one percent.\\\\n    They are just unhappy that the increase they are getting is \\\\nnot as big as the overly generous increases of the past.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, that is right. We are \\\\nactually increasing the amount of payment that we are making to \\\\nthem from the previous year, and as my mother will ask me when \\\\nshe sees these commercials, she will call me and say, ``Can you \\\\ntell me if I am in the right plan or not?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I tell here, ``Look. What would you expect from a \\\\ncommercial that is peddling a product to you? They want you to \\\\nbuy and so they try to pitch it to you in ways that will sell \\\\nit.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    And unfortunately, once some of these seniors lock into \\\\nsome of these policies, they realize they are not getting what \\\\nthey thought.\\\\n    Mr. DOGGETT. Well, I hope that in addition to what you do \\\\nin terms of payment, that we will continue to see a vigorous \\\\nexamination of the false claims that are made to ensure that \\\\neveryone who relies on Medicare Advantage and takes that \\\\napproach gets what they are promised.\\\\n    Thank you very much.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. I now recognize Mr. Smith from Nebraska.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you, Mr. Secretary and Mr. \\\\nChairman, as well.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for joining us today.\\\\n    I would like to start by calling your attention to a letter \\\\nI sent to you on March 10th, a February 25th, 2023, article in \\\\nthe New York Times and a subsequent report by the Washington \\\\nPost that have raised serious concerns about the Office of \\\\nRefugee Resettlement at HHS.\\\\n    Everything about this situation, from unaccompanied \\\\nchildren at the border to the lack of sponsor vetting to the \\\\nORR losing track of these children, I have to say, is \\\\ntroubling. So I hope you will respond to my letter hopefully by \\\\nApril 15th as requested so we can ensure that HHS is able to \\\\naddress these issues.\\\\n    The COVID public health emergency is scheduled to expire on \\\\nMay 11th. I welcome this expiration. There are hundreds though \\\\nof waivers, many of which have vastly benefitted patients \\\\naround the country, which immediately sunset, immediately \\\\nsunset with the PHE.\\\\n    These expirations have the potential to impact virtually \\\\nevery medical provider and patient but would have a \\\\ndisproportionate impact, I believe, on rural and underserved \\\\nareas like my home district in Nebraska.\\\\n    For example, it appears that without intervention, the \\\\nfollowing regulations will return to full force on May 12th: \\\\nthe 96-hour and offsite provider telehealth conditions of \\\\nparticipation for critical access hospitals; the three-day \\\\nhospital stay rule for skilled nursing facility admittance; and \\\\nthe long-term care hospital waiver of site neutrality in IPPS.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, should we have the concern that the return \\\\nto full enforcement of these regulations will have impact on \\\\npatient access to care?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, absolutely. And we thank \\\\nyou for the extension to some of those telehealth opportunities \\\\nthat will expire at the end of 2024, but we need to do \\\\nsomething permanently.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Okay. So I guess can we count on \\\\nyour support of efforts to make many of these provisions \\\\npermanent that have proven to be effective and especially for \\\\npatients themselves?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We will be there side by side with you \\\\nif you try to negotiate the terms of that because, again, most \\\\nof this is baked in in statute, and so we are going to have to \\\\nmake changes through Congress.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you. I appreciate that.\\\\n    Finally, earlier this year, CMMI released three new models \\\\ntargeting prescription drugs, and to date CMMI tested more than \\\\n50 models, only six of which have delivered statistically \\\\nsignificant savings and a less than 12 percent success rate, \\\\nnot acceptable in many eyes.\\\\n    I have been concerned for year that CMMI often overextends \\\\nitself by attempting to do too many things at once, and this \\\\nleads to overlapping and counterproductive results which can \\\\nharm both patients and providers, while currently wasting \\\\nMedicare&#x27;s finite resources.\\\\n    CMMI Director Fowler even said, quote, ``We need to move \\\\naway from this `spaghetti against wall, see what flowers bloom&#x27; \\\\napproach,&#x27;&#x27; end quote.\\\\n    Can you perhaps explain how simultaneously launching three \\\\ndifferent models targeting the same problem is different than \\\\nthe failed scattershot approach of the past?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. And, Congressman, I answer this knowing \\\\nthat as a former member, I like you and many others would \\\\nalways ask CMMI to test certain things. CMMI is supposed to be \\\\nour incubator, our place to test ideas made on a very small \\\\nscale.\\\\n    So if they do not work, we have not spent a ton of money, \\\\nbut if they do work, the return will be phenomenal, and what we \\\\nwant is to promote innovation.\\\\n    So CMMI is the place where we can tell the private sector \\\\ngive us your best idea. We will help seed it, and if it can go, \\\\ngreat. And if it does not, no one, including the taxpayer, \\\\nloses a whole lot.\\\\n    So I would want to work with you to make sure that we get \\\\ngood ideas coming forward to CMMI, but I would hate to do \\\\nanything that stifles the innovation and competitiveness that \\\\nCMMI promotes.\\\\n    Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Mr. Thompson, from California is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here.\\\\n    And I just appreciate your pointing out the benefits of the \\\\nACA, everything from access to preventive health care, doing \\\\naway with the preexisting condition limitations.\\\\n    And remember before we passed the ACA, being a woman was a \\\\npreexisting condition. Getting a handle on prescription drug \\\\ncosts. No more junk policies.\\\\n    There are countless examples of my district and everybody \\\\nelse&#x27;s district of how people that we represent have benefitted \\\\nfrom this, and thank you for your ongoing support.\\\\n    I would like to ask about two priorities of mine, mental \\\\nhealth and telemedicine. I am grateful that you and President \\\\nBiden have made mental health a high priority, but I am \\\\nconcerned that too much of our focus is on treating the \\\\nsymptoms of mental illness as opposed to understanding its \\\\nunderlying causes.\\\\n    There is not enough money in any President&#x27;s budget to \\\\ntreat every mental health symptom. We need to get ahead of the \\\\ncurve, and that is why Mr. Kelly and I have legislation that \\\\nwill provide tax incentives for brain research.\\\\n    I have sent that bill to Treasury to get their comments, \\\\nand I would appreciate it if we could send it to you and get \\\\nyour team&#x27;s comments on that as well.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you.\\\\n    And I would also like to ask about telemedicine.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Smith, Nebraska&#x27;s Smith, for raising \\\\nthis issue. It has been a long-time priority of mine, and I \\\\nthink one of the few silver linings in the COVID cloud, as you \\\\nknow, we passed my legislation to allow Medicare beneficiaries \\\\nto access health care services via telehealth, and that was a \\\\nreal help to them, and it really provided a better means by \\\\nwhich providers could treat their patients.\\\\n    And last year, we passed a two-year extension of those \\\\ntelehealth flexibilities. Part of the reason we passed that \\\\nextension was to give agencies, including HHS, the opportunity \\\\nto study health utilization over the past several years, how it \\\\nwas used, where it can be approved, and how it has affected \\\\ncost.\\\\n    I have legislation with Mr. Schweikert along with our \\\\ncolleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee which would \\\\nmake telehealth a permanent part of Medicare.\\\\n    That bill, by the way, was sponsored last year by over half \\\\nof the U.S. Senate.\\\\n    So as the two-year extension plays out, I would like to \\\\nknow how you envision the role of telehealth in the future, \\\\nparticularly in Medicare programs.\\\\n    And is there anything specific that your agency is looking \\\\nat to make sure that we have the best handle on this?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, I know we do not have much \\\\ntime, but what I will tell you is that we have seen the \\\\ndramatic results in behavioral health. We were not sure what \\\\nwould happen with folks who needed mental health care services. \\\\nWe thought perhaps they needed to have that person-to-person \\\\ncontact with their physician and their health care provider.\\\\n    It turns out that one of the greatest gains was made in \\\\nmental health where, because you could do this in the privacy \\\\nof your home, you felt more comfortable coming forward and \\\\naccessing mental health services.\\\\n    At the same time, we saw a dramatic drop in missed \\\\nappointments because now you do not have to worry about \\\\ntraveling there if you did not have transportation.\\\\n    We hope that we can work with our States to figure out how \\\\nwe deal with the cross-State issues that are involved with \\\\nlicensing of medical practitioners.\\\\n    Mr. THOMPSON. Are you saying you are for making it \\\\npermanent?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We are absolutely. It depends on where \\\\nwe are going, but, yes, there is absolutely a need to continue \\\\nsome of these telehealth flexibilities.\\\\n    Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. I recognize the gentleman from \\\\nPennsylvania, Mr. Kelly.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Becerra, it is good to see you again. It has been a \\\\nlittle bit of time in between.\\\\n    I just wanted to ask you something because I have been in \\\\nthe private sector my whole life, and I am trying to figure out \\\\nhow you put all of these pieces together. You have 83,000 \\\\nemployees; is that right?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. About there, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Kelly. That is a big payroll. That is a big payroll.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. And approximately 4,000 of these employees are \\\\nbased at the CMS, at the Woodlawn, Maryland headquarters.\\\\n    So how many employees are working today in person, actually \\\\nin person?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, the HHS workforce went back \\\\nto full-time work from the get-go. We were able to use \\\\ntelehealth during COVID, and now that we are beyond that, we \\\\nare able to continue workforce at full time.\\\\n    And you have heard some of the dramatic results of a \\\\nworkforce that has continued forward. Some have never left \\\\ncoming into the office or coming into work. Others are taking \\\\nadvantage of some of the flexibilities that we provide. So they \\\\ncould come in some days and work from a different site other \\\\ndays.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Yes, well, I have a photo. This picture--well, I \\\\nknow you said these people are at work. This is last Monday, \\\\nokay, March 20th. This is at 10:30 a.m. in the morning.\\\\n    So a beautiful parking lot. There is everything on there \\\\nexcept cars. I guess I do not know how your people get to work, \\\\nbut this is your office building, and you are telling me they \\\\nare working full time. They must be working full time from home \\\\nor some other way of doing that.\\\\n    I just do not understand that.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, that is not my----\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. This year--no, Mr. Secretary, this is the \\\\npicture. You have seen it before, and you know what it is.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. And then we request another $18 million in rent \\\\ncompared to last year. So when you look at the people that fund \\\\nall this stuff, and these are hardworking American taxpayers. I \\\\nlike the talk that goes back and forth, but what we are going \\\\nto do for six people, how we are going to shore this thing up, \\\\nhow we are going to do this, how we are going to cover all of \\\\nthis stuff, but at the end of the day, there is only one person \\\\nsigning that check, and that is the taxpayer.\\\\n    So why should the American people be expected to pay rent \\\\nfor an office building that is not even being used?\\\\n    There is so much waste in this government. There is so much \\\\nfat in this government it is impossible. I am embarrassed to go \\\\nback home and tell people this is the way it is supposed to \\\\nwork.\\\\n    This is not the way it is supposed to work. This is crazy \\\\nstuff. Nobody would look at this as a business model and say, \\\\n``You know, good idea. Let&#x27;s pay a lot of rent. Nobody has to \\\\nbe there, but we will pay rent.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Now you have said you are going to get the whole workforce \\\\nback to work. They are actually going to show up in person in \\\\ntheir buildings and actually work.\\\\n    And I am not talking about being on these little things we \\\\nhave set up. All of the little pictures show up and people get \\\\na chance to talk.\\\\n    I do not know. I think that they are so inefficient right \\\\nnow.\\\\n    Are you telling me--and I want to know this seriously--do \\\\nyou ever expect to be back fully at work at their desk in their \\\\nbuildings doing the work for the American people?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, we are fully at work full \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Well, this was a national holiday then probably, \\\\nright? This was March 20th.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. You know, Congressman, I do not even \\\\nrecognize that photo. That is not certainly a photo of my \\\\noffice building.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Oh, okay.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Maybe a parking lot of a building that \\\\nHHS has employees----\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Yeah.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I doubt that you could say that that \\\\nspeaks to the work that is being----\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Well, I would tell you this, that this is \\\\nWoodlawn. This is Woodlawn, Maryland, your headquarters. If \\\\nthis is your headquarters at 10:30 in the morning on a Monday \\\\nmorning on March 20th, there is something that does not match \\\\nwith what you are telling me.\\\\n    I do not want to keep grilling you on this because I will \\\\ntell you what. Both you and I pay a portion of whatever it is \\\\nthat we earned to fund all of these things.\\\\n    I just am appalled at the way this government works. There \\\\nis so much fat. The things that we have to do, yes, do them, \\\\nbut you had better learn how to work within a budget and make \\\\nsense.\\\\n    I cannot take this home and tell my people that I \\\\nrepresent, ``You know what? Listen. It may not make sense to \\\\nyou but it does not have to. This is the way we run our \\\\ngovernment.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    This is your parking lot in Woodlawn, Maryland. That is \\\\nwhere it took place. It did not take place someplace else.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. But you cannot say that the folks that \\\\nwork in that Maryland site, if there is a site there, are not \\\\nworking.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. I do not know. You know what? I would love to go \\\\nsometime. I would even like to go to the IRS and see those \\\\npeople working at their desk, and I would like to see your \\\\npeople working at their desk.\\\\n    Eighty-three thousand people getting a paycheck from the \\\\nAmerican taxpayer and we say if they will work part time, 30 \\\\nhours a week is part time. I would just say that this \\\\ngovernment has a lot of people that are part time.\\\\n    I thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Listen. I do appreciate your service because I like you \\\\npersonally. You know that, but I do. More than you, I like our \\\\ntaxpayers, and you are the guy in charge.\\\\n    It is a heavy lift. My God, 83,000 people.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. And they are working, Congressman.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Yeah, well, I know. I hear what you say. I am \\\\njust saying the pictures do not reveal that they are working, \\\\nand I think the American people deserve an answer.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I will bring you some pictures next \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Mr. KELLY. Okay. Very good. Thank you.\\\\n    I will go there with you.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Connecticut is \\\\nrecognized, Mr. Larson.\\\\n    Mr. LARSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Secretary Becerra, for being here. It is \\\\ngreat to have you back with the committee, and thank you for \\\\nyour continued work and support, both while you were here and \\\\nas Attorney General for the State of California and now in your \\\\ncapacity as Secretary of HHS.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, last year we passed the Inflation Reduction \\\\nAct, and as you hear Ranking Member Neal run through a number \\\\nof the things that were accomplished, I want to associate \\\\nmyself with his remarks.\\\\n    But as someone like yourself, who has been a long-time \\\\nadvocate of lower drug prices through Medicare negotiation, we \\\\nwere pleased to see that the President&#x27;s budget calls on \\\\nCongress to build on what we did in the Inflation Reduction \\\\nAct, which keeps money in seniors&#x27; pockets, while also making \\\\nMedicare more solvent.\\\\n    My question and to give you a time to do this, can you walk \\\\nus through your agency&#x27;s progress in implementing the drug cost \\\\nprovisions in the Inflation Reduction Act and tell us how each \\\\nprovision will continue to deliver for the American public?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman Larson, thank you for your \\\\nefforts over the years on these issues as well.\\\\n    Well, today those who are in need of insulin are getting it \\\\nfor $35 a month or less, and that is something that is saving \\\\nmost Americans several hundred dollars for this year alone.\\\\n    Those same Americans on Medicare now can access a vaccine, \\\\nwhether for the flu, for COVID, for shingles, and I always hear \\\\nabout shingles because apparently that is a pretty expensive \\\\nvaccine, 100 to $200. Free now, no out-of-pocket cost for folks \\\\non Medicare to access that. That is saving people quite a bit \\\\nof money.\\\\n    On top of that, we made the announcement that come \\\\nSeptember we will announce the first ten drugs that will be \\\\npart of that drug price negotiation that will begin.\\\\n    The companies that manufacture those drugs will go through \\\\nthe process then of negotiating for the best price for folks on \\\\nMedicare, and we hope to continue that process because at the \\\\nend of the day this is about saving people money.\\\\n    Right now Americans, as you know, are paying two or three \\\\ntimes more for the same drugs that are being sold in other \\\\ncountries, even if those drugs may have been manufactured HERE \\\\nin the U.S.\\\\n    Mr. LARSON. And so this direct negotiation, seniors have \\\\nlong been anticipating this. So it will be in September that we \\\\nwill hear.\\\\n    And how many drugs?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. There will be ten drugs, and then next \\\\nyear there will be 15 more. Then the year after that we add \\\\nmore, and every year we get to add them.\\\\n    I think in your wisdom you said make sure you do it right \\\\nfor the first ten and then let&#x27;s keep going from there.\\\\n    Mr. LARSON. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I greatly appreciate \\\\nit.\\\\n    And with that, I will yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Schweikert, \\\\nis recognized.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, this may sound odd, but I think you actually \\\\nhave one of the most interesting, if not one of the most \\\\ndifficult, jobs in the world.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I concur.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. But I also am constantly frustrated that we \\\\ndo not take your agency dramatically more seriously.\\\\n    And look. In the President&#x27;s budget, you have new taxes. \\\\nThe President&#x27;s budget has new taxes in there for shoring up \\\\npart of Medicare Part A. That equals out about what, 600, 660 \\\\nbillion over a ten-year cycle?\\\\n    And I am not asking you to play budget with me. I am just \\\\nsort of setting up a question.\\\\n    But the math from 2022 basically said Medicare shortfall \\\\nover 30 years, with interest, so this is from two years ago, \\\\nwas over $80 trillion.\\\\n    So I am elated, hey, you are going to talk about shoring up \\\\nthe Medicare Part A Trust Fund, but remember the vast majority \\\\nof Medicare spending is general fund.\\\\n    It turns out your agency, our obligation we made to \\\\nseniors, is the primaries, three-quarters of all the borrowing \\\\nover the next 30 years. You are the epicenter of what in many \\\\nways is the greatest threat to our republic, and that is our \\\\ndebt, you know, whether it be my kids or someone&#x27;s secure \\\\nretirement.\\\\n    So there are some things that are not meant to be got-you, \\\\nbut are there things we could do to help your folks on the \\\\ninnovation side be much more innovative, much more risk taking, \\\\nmuch more forward viewing?\\\\n    We have a document that was working through your numbers \\\\nsaying 31 percent of all Medicare spending is diabetic related. \\\\nOkay. Could we actually do an all-in approach to stabilize pre-\\\\ndiabetic populations?\\\\n    Do you remember that there is a phase one that has just \\\\nbegun of a potential cure for diabetes?\\\\n    In a weird way, you, your agency, break us or the \\\\ninnovation in your folks save us from a future that is just \\\\nbrutal, step-wise.\\\\n    And I guess my rambling is more about what can I do, what \\\\ncan we as members do. Because I have gotten some really crappy \\\\nresponses sometimes from your innovation folks who say, ``We \\\\nare looking at that,&#x27;&#x27; and then we never hear before.\\\\n    What can we do to make them almost techno-utopians, that we \\\\nhave to to push the solution?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So, Congressman, let me see if I can \\\\ngive you two or three different points, and you can build on \\\\nthem if you like.\\\\n    First, I go back to what I said earlier because you hit it \\\\non the money. Why are we spending so much money on diabetes? \\\\nBecause so many of these cases of diabetes could have been \\\\nprevented.\\\\n    And so rather than try to cure it, as my mom always used to \\\\nsay to me [speaking foreign language], ``Better to prevent than \\\\nto remediate.&#x27;&#x27; Why not try to prevent it?\\\\n    And my whole opening statement was about how moving from an \\\\nillness care system, which is what you are pointing out, to a \\\\nwellness care system.\\\\n    Mr. SCHWEIKERT. But what I beg of you is in your opening \\\\nstatement you said wellness care, but you did not say we need \\\\nto fix nutrition support. The way we do it, that is not \\\\nworking.\\\\n    There are actually things we can do to help people manage \\\\ntheir blood glucose. You have seen even the discussion of \\\\nsomething I can wear on my wrist that may tell me what my blood \\\\nglucose is.\\\\n    We now have--and I am going to screw it up--GPL-1 \\\\ninhibitors and a variety of those that are off patent. The fact \\\\nin medicine there may be a stem cell therapy coming.\\\\n    If it is the single biggest driver of debt in our country, \\\\nwhere is your all-in approach? Where is the maniacal fixation \\\\nthat we are going to take this on?\\\\n    Because it is not partisan. It is not Republican/Democrat. \\\\nIt is moral.\\\\n    And with that I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Mr. Blumenauer from Oregon is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, welcome back. I must say you look \\\\nincreasingly distinguished.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. More like you, huh?\\\\n    Mr. BLUMENAUER. Well, not that distinguished. [Laughter.)\\\\n    Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you for joining us. I want to thank \\\\nyou for the work that the department has done working with the \\\\nState of Oregon and, I think, Massachusetts dealing with \\\\ninnovative efforts in terms of the waiver, being able to focus \\\\non social determinants of health that actually help people with \\\\nthings like nutrition and housing that will lower costs.\\\\n    I appreciate the creativity and look forward to working \\\\nwith you and the department to realize the benefit of those.\\\\n    I would, as you know, be remiss if I did not mention one of \\\\nthe topics that we have discussed.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I see the chart.\\\\n    Mr. BLUMENAUER. In the last 30 years we have gone from a \\\\ncountry where there was no legal State either medical or adult \\\\nuse, and in that period of time we now have 37 States where at \\\\nleast some form of cannabis is legal. In 21 States, it is fully \\\\nlegal.\\\\n    The American public overwhelmingly supports it, and yet the \\\\nFederal Government is hopelessly out of step.\\\\n    I welcome the President&#x27;s call to do a reappraisal of how \\\\nwe characterize this so we can have the Federal Government \\\\ncatch up with where the American people are as it deals with \\\\nthe reality of cannabis, and I look forward to working with \\\\nyou.\\\\n    I appreciate your notion of the prescription drug reform. \\\\nThe American senior primarily does not have to pay two, three, \\\\nfour, five times the world price for prescription drugs in \\\\norder to underwrite medical research for the rest of the world.\\\\n    I am not certain that the pharmaceutical companies would \\\\nhold us hostage, but I think it is too steep a price. American \\\\nconsumers, especially seniors, should not be held hostage, and \\\\nI appreciate the work you are doing implementing this bidding \\\\neffort.\\\\n    Let me just touch on one other area. We have talked about \\\\nsome of the concerns we have, for example, in terms of for-\\\\nprofit Hospice, where we found shadow companies that have \\\\nbuildings, get money, but have nobody that they are serving.\\\\n    I notice that you have $5.2 billion for program integrity. \\\\nCan you talk about what that is going to enable us to do to \\\\nmake sure the taxpayer is getting full value?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, we know that during COVID \\\\nwe had more people die in nursing homes than was acceptable. We \\\\nknow that in too many cases people are profiting off of saying \\\\nthey are caring for some of our most precious loved ones who \\\\nneed help.\\\\n    And we want to make sure we get to go in and do some \\\\noversight. We want to make sure sunshine will be a good \\\\ndisinfectant when it comes to caring for our loved ones.\\\\n    And so we--hope you will consider, truly consider our \\\\nrequest for more money so we can do the oversight.\\\\n    I speak as a former Attorney General who worked hard to go \\\\nafter some of this abuse against elderly Americans, and we are \\\\ngoing to do as much as we can.\\\\n    Mr. BLUMENAUER. I think you will find bipartisan support on \\\\nthis committee to deal with the integrity of the Hospice \\\\nProgram so we are not cheating patients or the government.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Amen.\\\\n    Mr. BLUMENAUER. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. LaHood, is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. LaHOOD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, welcome. Mr. Secretary, last year you and I \\\\nspoke about my concerns with the response times from HHS in \\\\nresponding to congressional letters, and unfortunately, I \\\\ncannot say that that has improved today.\\\\n    Just this afternoon I received a letter that I sent asking \\\\nfor a response five months ago. I do not find it a coincidence \\\\nthat I received a response today when you are appearing before \\\\nthis committee.\\\\n    As we all know, Mr. Secretary, workforce challenges are a \\\\nmajor concern across industries, but particularly within the \\\\nhealthcare community. This is why last Congress I introduced a \\\\nbipartisan bill called the TRAIN Act, along with \\\\nRepresentatives Blunt Rochester of Delaware, which became law \\\\nat the end of last year.\\\\n    This bill addressed a nursing workforce issue caused by CMS \\\\nin which they began to recoup funds given to hospital-based \\\\nnursing schools based on a CMS error.\\\\n    Taking funds away from nursing schools during the pandemic \\\\nand workforce crisis certainly seemed misguided to me, and so \\\\nwe worked in a bipartisan way to address this issue to prevent \\\\nthe recoupment.\\\\n    However, we passed that law. It now appears that CMS is \\\\ngoing against congressional intent in their recent transmittal \\\\nnotice for implementation of the bill. CMS has created a \\\\ncomplicated formula to describe how these impacted schools \\\\nwould get their money back.\\\\n    The formula would not fully stop recoupment and returning \\\\nthe funds, but instead only provide between 29 and 76 percent \\\\nof the funds owed back to these schools.\\\\n    In our bill, CMS was directed to return the funds that were \\\\ntaken from each school. It is beyond frustrating, Mr. \\\\nSecretary, that something so clear in the statute could be \\\\nimplemented in this way.\\\\n    These hospital-based nursing schools, of which I have \\\\nseveral in my district, provide hands-on education allowing \\\\nmore nurses to enter the workforce and serve rural and \\\\nunderserved communities.\\\\n    Before our bill could become law, many of these schools \\\\nclosed and now CMS continues, Mr. Secretary, to impact the \\\\nremaining schools by only returning a portion of the funds they \\\\nare owed. This is simply unacceptable.\\\\n    And I would like your commitment, Mr. Secretary, to look \\\\ninto the creation of this formula and respond to me in writing \\\\non why CMS chose to go against our directive and the clear \\\\ncongressional intent on this issue.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, let me do this. I will \\\\ncall. After this hearing, I will try to reach out to you and \\\\nhave a specific conversation. You let me know who from CMS you \\\\nwant to have on that conversation and let&#x27;s follow up so we can \\\\nmake sure that we are following the intent the way it should \\\\nbe.\\\\n    Mr. LaHOOD. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, in my remaining time here I would also like \\\\nto comment briefly on my concerns with CMS determination on \\\\ncoverage with evidence development CED requirements for \\\\nAlzheimer&#x27;s treatments.\\\\n    In February, I along with 74 of my colleagues wrote to you \\\\nwith our concerns on how CMS continues to address the CED \\\\nprocess, particularly as it impacts constituents and their \\\\nfamilies and caregivers in my district who are unable to \\\\nparticipate in academic clinical trials.\\\\n    I have serious concerns about how CMS is making decisions \\\\non this issue, and I await your timely response to our letters \\\\nsent to you on February 6, and I would just say that does not \\\\nmean waiting five months from now.\\\\n    You mentioned earlier in Mr. Buchanan&#x27;s comments that you \\\\ntold the advocates to keep pushing. There is immense \\\\nfrustration that my constituents and many people across the \\\\ncountry cannot participate in these academic clinical trials.\\\\n    If you could, respond to that.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes, and we are trying to make sure that \\\\nwe do provide for a diversity of participation in these trials. \\\\nOftentimes we find that folks in rural American do not get to \\\\nparticipate in trials. Folks in some urban poor areas of \\\\nAmerica do not get asked to participate.\\\\n    So we are trying to make sure that those who will \\\\nparticipate include those from all parts of our country. We \\\\ncould do everything we can within the clinical trials, but at \\\\nthe end of the day, it is the investigators who have to make \\\\nsure that they are pursuing folks to participate.\\\\n    But I am absolutely prepared to work with you and others \\\\nwho are interested in this subject to make sure what where \\\\nthere is a clinical trial that everyone has an opportunity to \\\\nparticipate.\\\\n    Mr. LaHOOD. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from New Jersey is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Welcome back, Mr. Secretary. Thanks for the \\\\nwork on the Biden team. You have done an outstanding job.\\\\n    Americans emerged from the pandemic with the best economy \\\\nin decades. The pandemic opened their eyes to the titanic need \\\\nof skilled nursing.\\\\n    So I welcome the President&#x27;s bold goal to remake our \\\\nNation&#x27;s 15,000 nursing homes, and I am damned angry when I \\\\nlook at the results.\\\\n    This is a $130 billion industry. Wall Street&#x27;s control over \\\\nnursing homes grows with risks and abuses. Problems in our \\\\nnursing homes have been ignored for too long.\\\\n    We need transparency for tax dollars going into big \\\\ncompanies, and we must hold bad actors accountable when they \\\\nprovide substandard care for our seniors.\\\\n    A lot of statistics came out of these last two and a half \\\\nyears, three years. I am not going to go into too many \\\\nstatistics because I have done that before.\\\\n    Private equity firms, they are having a song and a dance. \\\\nYou wonder why so many nursing homes are closing. You cannot \\\\nprovide service unless you pay the help. You cannot provide \\\\nservice if the help is not up for the job. You have got to pay \\\\nfor that. You get what you pay for.\\\\n    And private equity gets what they pay for. So we need \\\\ntransparency.\\\\n    One year into the White House initiative, what has this \\\\nAdministration done to increase transparency of ownership so \\\\nthat we could figure out who owns the darn place and management \\\\nof our skilled nursing facilities?\\\\n    What has happened in one year?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman----\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Tell me that in two sentences.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. First, thank you for your advocacy in \\\\nthis area.\\\\n    We have for the first time in as far as I can remember \\\\nrequired the disclosure of ownership interest in these \\\\nfacilities because we know that a shell game is often played \\\\nwith regard to who actually handles them.\\\\n    And probably something which you did not quite say it \\\\nexplicitly is that oftentimes when ownership goes into the \\\\nhands of a Wall Street firm, they are in there for the money, \\\\nand so what they do is they extract assets and they oftentimes \\\\nleave a shell.\\\\n    And the folks who are needing care are the ones who suffer \\\\nas a result of having less than ideal services.\\\\n    We are also moving forward on the idea of having minimum \\\\nstaffing levels so that regardless of who purchases that \\\\nfacility, you cannot move below a certain level.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Excuse me, Mr. Secretary. You have been \\\\nlooking at that for years. Your Administration, the previous \\\\nadministration, the administration before that, the \\\\nadministration before that.\\\\n    What have you done?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman----\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. Do you want me to give you a list in New \\\\nJersey?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I cannot speak for the previous \\\\nadministration, but I can tell you we are in the process of \\\\ncoming out with a rule that will require minimum staffing \\\\nlevels. That is more than I have seen any administration do.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. And you are going to work this out with the \\\\nequity firms?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We do not need to work that out with any \\\\nequity firm. We get to do that based on a rule that is based on \\\\nthe authorities you gave us.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. To your health.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. PASCRELL. I yield. [Laughter.]\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    You go, Bill.\\\\n    I am deeply concerned, Mr. Secretary, with the state of \\\\nhealth services and human services in our country. I continue \\\\nto hear from providers across the country, which I was one for \\\\nthree decades, they are closing the doors, walking away from \\\\nproviding care to patients every day because of the challenges \\\\nthat have come from this administration and because of some of \\\\nyour decisions, sir.\\\\n    Physicians are the ones that continue to show up to the \\\\nfront lines and make sure that patients receive the care that \\\\nthey need. Doctors are the ones who provide the health and \\\\nhuman services to patients across this country.\\\\n    And if this pattern continues, there will not be enough \\\\ndoctors left to take care of patients across America.\\\\n    Your budget grows. You treat no one. You are a lawyer, and \\\\nyou ask providers to do more with less until they close their \\\\ndoors.\\\\n    Congress spent years negotiating a solution to solve \\\\nsurprise billing and do it in a balanced fashion, and, yes, we \\\\ntook patients out of it. That we did.\\\\n    Congress passed a No Surprises Act to protect patients, \\\\ncreate a balanced process. The President signed it into law. \\\\nYou ignored that.\\\\n    And we created a bill that created incentive for doctors \\\\nwho want to be in network and for insurance companies to want \\\\ndoctors in network. But you decided to implement the law in a \\\\nmanner that unfairly tips the scale in favor of insurers by \\\\nplacing undue weight on the qualified payment amount, which was \\\\njust one component of arbitration and did not have weight over \\\\nany others.\\\\n    You directly defied the law as written, and it is \\\\ninteresting considering you are a lawyer that you would violate \\\\nthe law.\\\\n    And your illegal actions have led to a backlog of claims, \\\\nand you called the claims recently to be frivolous. Well, you \\\\nask the patients that got the care if it is frivolous, and you \\\\nask the doctors that have to pay their staff and their salaries \\\\nand to stay open and to be in the black.\\\\n    You ask them if it is frivolous. You said patients are not \\\\naffected. They are affected. Doctors retire or they quit taking \\\\ncalls.\\\\n    You come in in that ambulance and guess what. There is no \\\\ndoctor on call because of the way you have implemented the No \\\\nSurprises Act. You.\\\\n    So you are directly harming patients actually. Doctors and \\\\nhospitals need to be in the black to keep their doors open, to \\\\ncontinue to provide a service. And they cannot pay their help \\\\nif they do not.\\\\n    What this says to me is you clearly do not value the work \\\\nof physicians and surgeons and what they do for those in need, \\\\nand without them we have no health system at all.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, will you implement the No Surprise Act as \\\\nwritten in statute and not stray from the letter of the law, as \\\\nyou have continued to do, as you have been informed that you \\\\nhave done by the courts, and maybe get out of the courtroom and \\\\ninto the emergency room and the operating room where HHS \\\\nbelongs?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, I respect especially the \\\\npassion with which you speak to the subject, and so what I will \\\\ntell you is where we have gotten guidance from the courts, we \\\\nhave followed it.\\\\n    We will try to do the best we can. If you are one of those \\\\nwho helped pass the law, I thank you. You probably remember \\\\nwhen that was being discussed, I think at that point people \\\\nthought ten, maybe 20,000 disputes would be sent for this \\\\nindependent dispute resolution process.\\\\n    In the first eight months, 164,000 claims were filed.\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. But you are responsible for that, sir. The \\\\nway you have implemented the law has driven this. You took away \\\\nthe fair process.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, if you look at what we \\\\ndid----\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. Well, of course they want to go to \\\\narbitration.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, there is nothing that we \\\\ndid----\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. You called it frivolous, which is an insult \\\\nto every provider out there.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I am not calling it. It is the \\\\narbitrators.\\\\n    Mr. WENSTRUP. I yield back.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. The arbitrators are the ones that are \\\\nsaying that those were frivolous claims.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Davis, is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the \\\\nrecord a statement describing the accessibility of imported e-\\\\ncigarettes and vaping material to young people in our country.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Without objection, so ordered.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your work and the \\\\noutstanding work of members of your staff.\\\\n    Medicare physicians&#x27; pay and its impact on patient access \\\\nto care remains a major issue for many of my constituents. In \\\\nfact, adjusted for inflation, in-practice costs Medicare \\\\nphysicians&#x27; pay actually declined 26 percent from 2001 to 2023, \\\\nor by 1.8 percent per year, on average.\\\\n    Nonpartisan government stakeholders are recognizing the \\\\ndamage and impact these payments cuts are having on patients&#x27; \\\\naccess to care.\\\\n    The 2021 Medicare Trustees&#x27; report states that after the \\\\nchange in the delivery system or level of update by subsequent \\\\nlegislation, the Trustees expect access to Medicare \\\\nparticipating physicians to become a significant issue in the \\\\nlong term.\\\\n    To help address this growing problem, physicians are \\\\npushing for an annual Medicare payment update tied to inflation \\\\nas measured by the Medicare Economic Index, the MEI.\\\\n    Even the March 2023 MedPAC report to Congress includes \\\\nrecommendations that Congress increase the 2024 Medicare \\\\nphysician payment rate above current law, with an inflation-\\\\nbased payment.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, could you share with us some of the \\\\nAdministration&#x27;s thinking relative to Medicare payments to \\\\nphysicians?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely, Congressman, and as you \\\\nknow, the President declared emphatically during the State of \\\\nthe Union that not only was he going to protect Medicare for \\\\ntoday&#x27;s seniors and Americans with disabilities who receive \\\\nMedicare, but he was going to protect it for the next \\\\ngeneration as well.\\\\n    And so his budget makes sure that Medicare not only remains \\\\nstrong, but it continues to offer benefits that, under \\\\ntraditional Medicare fee for service or under managed care \\\\nMedicare, either way Americans receive their services.\\\\n    And that is why the proposal that we have put forward when \\\\nit comes to reimbursement to providers continues to increase \\\\nthe amount that they will receive.\\\\n    The amount that we are proposing in this year&#x27;s proposal is \\\\ngreater than the amount that we had proposed last year, and of \\\\ncourse, we protect all Medicare benefits. We do not cut any \\\\nbenefits. We continue to preserve access to those same benefits \\\\nthat all Americans have become accustomed to having under \\\\nMedicare.\\\\n    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much, and I am sure that the \\\\nthousands of Medicare physicians, as well as their millions of \\\\npatients, will be delighted to hear this answer. Thank you so \\\\nmuch.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Ferguson, \\\\nis recognized.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here.\\\\n    A couple of items here. First of all, one of the things I \\\\nam very concerned about is antimicrobial resistance. We have \\\\nnot been doing a great job in this country of developing the \\\\nnext generation of antibiotics to fight these resistant \\\\ninfections.\\\\n    It has cost the system almost $5 billion a year, and really \\\\nprobably somewhere around 35, 36,000 people a year die because \\\\nof this.\\\\n    We have a system failure here. It is a failure of the \\\\nmarketplace, and there are some very specific reasons.\\\\n    Do you think congressional action is needed to correct \\\\nthis, to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic and to address \\\\nthe immediate cost to the system?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, first I have to say \\\\nhalleluiah for asking that question because nobody asks about \\\\nantimicrobial resistance.\\\\n    It is absolutely essential, and absolutely Congress needs \\\\nto act because we have to figure out a way to get the market to \\\\nwant to invent some of these new lifesaving treatments.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. Good. I look forward to working with you on \\\\nthat.\\\\n    You know, I----\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Can I just add real quickly?\\\\n    Internationally, we are trying to take this on as well, and \\\\nso there is a lot of interest internationally to deal with \\\\nantimicrobial resistance.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. We just want to make sure that we lead.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. So with that, listen. You touched on Medicare \\\\nAdvantage issues. Again, I just do not share your position on \\\\nthat.\\\\n    I want to say this. You made a comment to my colleague here \\\\nfrom Ohio, Dr. Wenstrup, that you were trying to implement the \\\\nsurprise billing law the way we intended it, and I will simply \\\\nsay that trying is nothing more than failing slowly. Either you \\\\nare going to do it or you are not.\\\\n    And I would encourage you to do it. So do not fail slowly. \\\\nJust get it done the way Congress intended for that and the way \\\\nthat this committee intended for you to implement that and to \\\\nmake the changes.\\\\n    Next, a couple of series of questions here. Over the past \\\\ndecade and a half or so, really, yeah, about the past decade \\\\nand a half has there been any sector of the health care \\\\nenvironment that has grown at a slower rate than inflation?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Any sector of----\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. Yes, any sector in our health care economy \\\\nthat has grown slower than inflation.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We would probably have to crack our \\\\nheads together to see if we could find one.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. You will get a split in your skull you will \\\\nhave to crack your head so hard so many times on that.\\\\n    Has there been an increase or decrease in premiums in the \\\\npast decade and a half?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Well, here actually there is some good \\\\nnews. If I take you on the Affordable Care Website, you can \\\\nfind a premium today for----\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. No, no, no, not the cost of individual but \\\\nthe overall cost of the premium including the subsidies that \\\\nhave to be paid to drive that cost lower.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Okay. Well, we still have to take a look \\\\nbecause I am going to----\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. The answer is I do not think you are going to \\\\nfind many folks that are saying that their health care premiums \\\\nare going down.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. For most the costs have gone down.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. Really?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. In what State?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Pretty much every State that has access \\\\nto the Affordable Care Act.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. You are going to tell us that the health care \\\\npremiums in the State of Georgia are lower now than they were a \\\\ndecade and a half ago?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely, absolutely. When you can \\\\nfind a premium at $10 a month or less----\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. No, no, no, no, no, not to the individual. I \\\\nam talking about the overall cost to the system.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I get where you are going, but what I am \\\\nsaying to you American----\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. Well, I am getting where I am going because \\\\nwe are spending entirely too much money. We have got an \\\\ninefficient system.\\\\n    Reclaiming my time, a couple of other quick questions.\\\\n    Are there more rural hospitals in America today or fewer? \\\\nJust more or less.\\\\n    Fewer. I will answer it for you, at least in my district.\\\\n    Are Americans healthier today than they were in 2010?\\\\n    And do we have more solo practitioners or more vertically \\\\nintegrated health care systems where an insurance company owns \\\\na PBM that owns a pharmacy that owns the health care system?\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON. My point here is that how you judge success--\\\\n--\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. FERGUSON [continuing]. Of government-run health care \\\\nand how we do are maybe two different things.\\\\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I would yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you.\\\\n    The representative from California is recognized. Ms. \\\\nSanchez.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your testimony today.\\\\n    My colleagues and I worked tirelessly to pass the Inflation \\\\nReduction Act and to lower drug costs under Medicare, and these \\\\ncritical policies are saving beneficiaries an average of $800 \\\\nper person per year. I call that progress.\\\\n    I am also pleased to see that the Administration is \\\\nbuilding on the work in the last Congress to extend ACA premium \\\\ntax credits as well as put more money in Medicare \\\\nbeneficiaries&#x27; pockets by capping out-of-pocket drug costs.\\\\n    I also think it is important to highlight your plan to \\\\nclose the Medicaid coverage gap, particularly as we see \\\\nmillions of Californians currently go through the \\\\nredetermination process as the PHE comes to an end.\\\\n    These are the types of investments that we must continue to \\\\nmake in order to meaningfully reduce the cost weighing heaviest \\\\non working families and to help close those health care \\\\ndisparities.\\\\n    The HHS budget also includes expanded funding for long-term \\\\ncare through Medicaid home and community-based services. I want \\\\nto bring your attention to that because studies have predicted \\\\nthat the number of seniors over the age of 85 who will need \\\\npersonal care due to fragility of aging and other disabilities \\\\nwill quadruple between now and 2040.\\\\n    Now, these are folks that do not need 24-hour medical care, \\\\nbut they do need assistance with everyday living tasks like \\\\neating, bathing, cleaning. Seniors with dementia, in \\\\nparticular, need these, and these tasks often fall on the \\\\nshoulders of working families, and these tasks are often \\\\nuncompensated.\\\\n    I have experience in this. I have been extremely fortunate \\\\nto share caregiving responsibilities with my siblings for both \\\\nof my parents, but I know firsthand how difficult it is to \\\\nbalance being a working mom and a caregiver, even when you have \\\\nthe means to do so.\\\\n    An average year of long-term care costs over $70,000, and \\\\nmost seniors&#x27; entire life savings are a little more than double \\\\nthan that, and Latino and African American households have \\\\nsignificantly less in retirement savings than the average \\\\nhousehold.\\\\n    For example, half of elderly Latinos rely on Social \\\\nSecurity as their sole source of retirement income.\\\\n    In Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, none of those \\\\ninsurers cover long-term supportive care. The only option for \\\\nthose who can afford assisted living facilities, costly private \\\\nlong-term insurance plans or if they qualify for Medicaid.\\\\n    So, Mr. Secretary, I want to know what the department doing \\\\nto address the predicted rise in long-term care needs.\\\\n    And how would you suggest financing such a system that does \\\\nnot solely rely on Medicaid?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, first, thank you for your \\\\ncommitment to this particular subject.\\\\n    Secondly, I mentioned the work that we are doing to try to \\\\nimprove the services at existing facilities, whether it is a \\\\nnursing home facility or providing Hospice care.\\\\n    We are in this budget providing for $150 billion in \\\\nMedicaid home and community-based services because we know \\\\nthere is the need to increase access to that long-term care.\\\\n    We are doing everything we can to do more inspection of \\\\nfacilities because we know that there have been a number of \\\\ncomplaints, and the need to make sure that there is \\\\ntransparency in the services that are provided, and we are \\\\ndoing as much as we can to try to increase the ability of \\\\nStates to do some of those inspections themselves and to the \\\\ncomplaint surveys&#x27; response themselves as well.\\\\n    So we have an investment of about $500 million, a little \\\\nbit more than $500 million dollars in discretionary monies to \\\\nhelp those States do those survey and certification programs.\\\\n    Ms. SANCHEZ. I thank you for your work on that and for your \\\\npresence today.\\\\n    And I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Kansas, Mr. Estes, is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here today.\\\\n    You know, when I combed through the President&#x27;s budget that \\\\nadds $17 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years, I see \\\\nmuch of the failed policies that have caused record inflation \\\\nover the last two years, and it is hurting Kansas families.\\\\n    In fact, a surgery center in Wichita told me that this year \\\\nmore patients are delaying surgery because they simply have to \\\\nmake a choice between having a procedure or putting food on the \\\\ntable.\\\\n    Secretary Becerra, over the last two years I have heard \\\\nfrom numerous doctors in my district and the State that have \\\\nindicated participation in Medicare is becoming untenable due \\\\nto the instability of reimbursement year after year. This means \\\\npatient access is in jeopardy across the country, including my \\\\nhome State of Kansas and particularly in rural areas.\\\\n    I have got a couple questions that are really yes or no.\\\\n    I mean do you recognize the instability of the physician \\\\nfee schedule the past two years that has disproportionately \\\\nappropriated patients, particularly rural ones, and \\\\nparticularly in specialty care?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, I think we all, and I \\\\nremember being a member of Congress as well. The challenge that \\\\nwe have in trying to make sure that we are adequately \\\\nreimbursing providers has always been there. It is something \\\\nthat we always have to address and you have to address.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. And will you help work with us and commit to \\\\nhelping evaluate the impact on rural access before you make \\\\nfuture reimbursement changes?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. I also am concerned a little bit particularly \\\\nabout changes made under the REMs for mifepristone. Under your \\\\ndirection REMs have been changed so that a woman no longer \\\\nneeds to see her physician in person in order to receive this \\\\nharmful drug, but one in five women who take this drug need \\\\nmedical intervention following its use. That is one in five.\\\\n    Your own FDA said that women should not take it if they \\\\nhave an ectopic pregnancy, and FDA explains that if an ectopic \\\\npregnancy is not identified and removed, it can rupture and \\\\ncause abdominal bleeding that can kill the pregnant woman.\\\\n    Ectopic pregnancies can only be ruled out by a health care \\\\nprovider using blood tests and an ultrasound.\\\\n    And FDA has further warnings for women if they have \\\\nproblems with their adrenal glands or if they are taking \\\\ncertain medications. This critical information is given by \\\\nhealth care providers with access to their medical history.\\\\n    Do you think the new REMs for this drug put women in \\\\ndanger?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, FDA puts out those REMs \\\\nafter reviewing all the science and the evidence that is out \\\\nthere. Mifepristone has been available for more than 20 years. \\\\nIt has been proven to be, as FDA has to show it, to be a safe \\\\nand effective drug.\\\\n    And now they are moving forward, based on several years of \\\\nevidence and especially during COVID where they found that it \\\\ncould be prescribed safely and effectively without having to \\\\nhave the in-person visit by the patient in order to get access \\\\nto the drug.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. I am just concerned that one in five need \\\\nadditional care afterwards. That has no bearing on that, but it \\\\nis caused by that, as well as the ectopic pregnancies.\\\\n    How do you plan to help make sure that they are checked for \\\\nan ectopic pregnancy before this drug is dispensed to them?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes, and I would need to check those \\\\nnumbers. I have not heard those numbers that you have recited. \\\\nAnd I know I hear from my wife, who is a high-risk OB-GYN, all \\\\nthe time about this.\\\\n    This is a drug that has proven itself over the course of \\\\ntime. You do not just get access to it because you want it. You \\\\nstill have to get it prescribed, and so your physician, your \\\\nmedical provider, would still have to prescribe it.\\\\n    And so those kinds of areas where you need to have \\\\nsafeguards are still in place. It is just that the in-person \\\\nrequirement that a woman go to a particular spot to get that \\\\nprescription drug would be removed.\\\\n    Mr. ESTES. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. \\\\nSmucker, is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Good afternoon, Secretary.\\\\n    The Work and Welfare Subcommittee is having a hearing \\\\ntomorrow looking at strengthening TANF work requirements, and I \\\\nam sure you know that only six States have a 50 percent TANF \\\\nwork participation rate requirement, and 34 States have a zero \\\\npercent requirement.\\\\n    How is HHS making sure that States are being held \\\\naccountable in implementing TANF work requirements?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, that is a great question, \\\\nand I hope we can actually work on some of this because we are \\\\ntrying to work with the States to get more information.\\\\n    We all heard about the situation in Mississippi where a lot \\\\nof TANF dollars were misused, and that was as a result of State \\\\nofficials not keeping watch of the money.\\\\n    We would love to work with you to make sure that our work \\\\nto do oversight continues forward, the program integrity work \\\\nthat we do, but we really need your help.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. So you agree that it is a problem we need to \\\\naddress and we can work together on that?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Well, when State officials divert \\\\ndollars that are meant for needy families, that is absolutely a \\\\nproblem.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. I am talking specifically about the work \\\\nrequirements.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We can absolutely talk to you about any \\\\nnumber of issues including work requirements, but what we want \\\\nto do is make sure that we are getting dollars to the families \\\\nthat are needy that qualify for those funds.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you. I look forward to talking with you \\\\nabout it.\\\\n    As you know, as a hospital insurance fund trustee, the \\\\ntrustees currently estimate that Medicare Part A will go \\\\ninsolvent in 2028, at which point the program will only be able \\\\nto pay 90 percent of benefits, meaning seniors will face a ten \\\\npercent cut in benefits; is that right?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. What I can tell you is that the \\\\nPresident&#x27;s budget addresses that to make sure that no senior, \\\\nno person with disability will face any change in their \\\\nbenefits.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. Let&#x27;s talk about that because I do appreciate \\\\nthat there are some proposals in the budget to extend the \\\\nsolvency. I mean that certainly is a goal shared by Republicans \\\\nand Democrats.\\\\n    So I do hope that we can work together in a bipartisan \\\\nfashion. However, I do have trouble seeing how the math adds up \\\\nin the some of the President&#x27;s proposal.\\\\n    And a basic question. I think we will agree on this. If the \\\\ngovernment raises taxes by $100 and then spends that $100, it \\\\nis a zero impact on the deficit, correct?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Are you speaking about the Medicare \\\\nProgram?\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. If the government raises taxes by 100 and then \\\\nspends 100, what is the net impact on the deficit?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. But if you are going to relate that to \\\\nMedicare, then I want to make sure we are----\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. No, it is a basic question.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Well, if you are speaking about Medicare \\\\nand the President&#x27;s budget, then I could answer that question \\\\nbecause I do not want you to then say that I have said that the \\\\nPresident will not strengthen Medicare.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. That was a basic question, but is it true that \\\\nthe President&#x27;s budget counts savings from potential drug \\\\npricing reforms towards both deficit reduction and then also \\\\ninjecting funds into the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. The President&#x27;s budget, because it \\\\nreduces deficits over the course of the next ten years will be \\\\ngood for America and our economy. At the same time, the \\\\nPresident&#x27;s budget will strengthen the Medicare Program without \\\\ncutting any benefits.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. But it really sounds like a budget gimmick \\\\nwhen you are counting both the same cuts as deficit reduction \\\\nand also injecting funds into the trust fund.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Well, the Congressional Budget Office, \\\\nwhich is your scorekeeper, also shows that the President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget will save us money.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. Is it true that the President&#x27;s budget \\\\nincreases taxes on small businesses by $650 billion?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So the President said that no one who \\\\nearns less than $400,000, and if you are a small business \\\\nperson at the end of the day----\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. The budget does increase taxes by $650 \\\\nbillion. Will those new taxes be used to pay for Medicare \\\\nsolvency?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. And those are taxes on corporations and \\\\nthe wealthiest individuals, but again, anyone earning less than \\\\n$400,000, whether it is through your small business or through \\\\nyour employment, will not pay any increased taxes.\\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. It is the double counting of the same funds \\\\nthat makes no sense.\\\\n    And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into the record a \\\\nbudget model from Penn Wharton, that their analysis points this \\\\nout, the double counting and the budget gimmicks that the plan \\\\nemploys.\\\\n    So I would like to submit that into the record if I could.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Without objection, so ordered.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Mr. SMUCKER. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from New York is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. HIGGINS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here.\\\\n    In New York, every single hospital is reporting significant \\\\nnursing shortages that they cannot fill. Over the last three \\\\nyears, contract labor has increased nationally over 250 percent \\\\nand significantly in New York State as well.\\\\n    So many nurses across the country have left hospital-based \\\\npositions and have gone to these traveling staffing agencies. \\\\nIt is understandable because the work is better, the scheduling \\\\nis more flexible, but these agencies charge hospitals a \\\\nsignificant markup to employ their nurses, leading some \\\\nhospitals to accuse them of price gouging.\\\\n    The Federal Government pays a lot for health care, probably \\\\n$1.6 trillion every year for Medicare, Medicaid, tax treatment, \\\\nVA. It is a lot of money, but it is a lot of leverage.\\\\n    Is your agency aware of this problem?\\\\n    And are there other efforts to address the shortage in a \\\\nlegitimate way without profiting significantly, these agencies \\\\nthat employ traveling nurses?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, thank you for the question.\\\\n    And just as the State of New York is suffering through a \\\\nworkforce shortage, so are, I know, my State of California and \\\\nI suspect every member at this dias would say the same thing.\\\\n    We are making investments and this budget does make \\\\ninvestments to help expand the workforce. It also helps provide \\\\nStates with the opportunity to train more people, whether \\\\nnurses, doctors, or childcare workers.\\\\n    We want to increase the size of the workforce. One of the \\\\nthings that would help us increase the size of the workforce is \\\\nif we get more women back into the workforce. We know that it \\\\nhas been very difficult.\\\\n    If you cannot find childcare, sometimes it keeps people \\\\nfrom being able to go to work, whether you are the father or \\\\nthe mother, but principally we know mothers have that prime \\\\nresponsibility more often than fathers do.\\\\n    And so we are working where we can. We did a grant \\\\nproposal. That was, I think, last year, $103 million, where we \\\\nput it out, and the recipients of the grant, we did not put a \\\\nlot of restrictions on it. What we said is we want you to use \\\\nit to try to retain some of your workforce, increase your \\\\nworkforce, or up-train your workforce.\\\\n    And what we are trying to do is help keep folks in the \\\\nhealth care profession.\\\\n    Mr. HIGGINS. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER [presiding]. The chair recognizes the gentleman \\\\nfrom Oklahoma.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here today.\\\\n    My time is short. So let me be real quick here.\\\\n    Two years ago during your first budget hearing, you \\\\nresponded to one of my questions by saying that as Secretary of \\\\nHHS, you are ``in the business of creating more jobs and \\\\ngetting people the health care they need,&#x27;&#x27; end quote.\\\\n    As you know, our current system is complex, unaffordable \\\\nfor small businesses to offer health care.\\\\n    Do you support the previous administration&#x27;s policy to \\\\nallow small businesses to cover the premiums of their employees \\\\nthrough individual coverage health reimbursement accounts, also \\\\nknown as ICHRAs?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, I want to make sure. If you \\\\nare talking about plans that would violate the Affordable Care \\\\nAct and provide less benefits, if they are what we call these \\\\njunk plans or skinny plans, we do not support those.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. So you are saying based on your Website on \\\\nOctober 17th, 2019, you said you are willing to support plans \\\\nthat are not junk plans.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Correct. Plans that offer real benefits, \\\\nthey may have a low payment, but the reason they have a low \\\\npayment is because when you really need to use them, they offer \\\\nyou very little coverage for the services you will use, and you \\\\nare stuck with the bill for the high coverage of those \\\\nparticular benefits.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. So just so I am clear, you and I are clear, you \\\\nare willing to work with us on ICHRAs as long as they are not \\\\nso-called junk plans?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Willing to work with you on any plan, \\\\nwhatever the idea is, because you are entitled to that work \\\\neffort from our folks at the agency.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. I think that is a yes.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary----\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. That is a yes. That is a yes.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Mr. Secretary, since the bipartisan Orphan Drug \\\\nAct was enacted into law 40 years ago, rare disease and cancer \\\\npatients have benefitted from the development of over 600 new \\\\ntreatments. This is tremendous achievement though there is more \\\\nwork to be done.\\\\n    More than 30 million Americans across this country are \\\\nliving with a rare disease or disorder, and too many patients \\\\nliving with rare diseases and cancer still have no treatments \\\\navailable to them.\\\\n    Some of you may have family members with a rare disease. So \\\\nyou know the pain they face every day and the hope they have in \\\\nspite of everything. I have a sister who passed away from spina \\\\nbifida and another sister and her daughter living with spina \\\\nbifida.\\\\n    Unfortunately, the Democrats&#x27; so-called Inflation Reduction \\\\nAct threatens the continued success of the Orphan Drug Act. \\\\nSpecifically, it does not protect therapies that treat two or \\\\nmore orphan diseases from the law&#x27;s price setting scheme.\\\\n    As a result, we already know of two companies that have \\\\ncited the IRA as a reason not to continue rare disease drug \\\\ndevelopment. It is sad this budget proposes to expand those \\\\nharmful policies further.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, will you commit to doing what you can, be a \\\\nguidance in rulemaking to ensure that the pipeline of life-\\\\naltering therapies continue for patients living with rare \\\\ndiseases and cancers?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, we will absolutely do what \\\\nwe can to make sure that some of those orphan drugs are still \\\\navailable because otherwise many of those folks would have no \\\\nhope.\\\\n    Mr. HERN. Mr. Chairman, I think that is a yes, and I \\\\nappreciate it again that you are working with us on these \\\\nissues because there are problems that we need to work together \\\\non that have been falling through loopholes and have been \\\\nsubject to concern based on what is coming out of the recent \\\\npolicies from the Administration.\\\\n    So I appreciate you working with us.\\\\n    And I yield back.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. Thank you.\\\\n    I now yield to myself.\\\\n    Thank you, Ranking Member Neal, and thank you, Secretary \\\\nBecerra, for being here today.\\\\n    One of my biggest concerns about the United States health \\\\ncare is the current workforce shortage that we are all facing \\\\naround the country. This shortage is particularly concerning in \\\\nrural communities where hospitals are closing at higher rates \\\\nthan anywhere else in the country.\\\\n    While inflation caused by the Biden Administration&#x27;s out-\\\\nof-control spending is partly to blame for hospitals \\\\nstruggling, a dwindling workforce is often also cited as one of \\\\nthe biggest problems for rural hospitals.\\\\n    One policy which contributed to the shrinking health care \\\\nworkforce was a vaccine mandate for the health care workers, \\\\nwhich was put in place by the Biden Administration. The Centers \\\\nfor Medicare and Medicaid services gave hospitals an ultimatum: \\\\nforce your entire staff to get vaccinated or no Medicaid \\\\nservices, or they will no longer participate in Medicare or \\\\nMedicaid Program.\\\\n    In rural America where a disproportionate share of patients \\\\nare enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, this gave hospitals an \\\\nimpossible choice. Your agency forced health care workers that \\\\ndid not want to get a vaccine out of the workforce.\\\\n    Secretary Becerra, on September 18th of last year, \\\\nPresident Biden declared that the pandemic was over. The \\\\nAdministration has also announced they plan to end the public \\\\nhealth emergency on May 11th of this year.\\\\n    Can you please explain to me why this Administration \\\\nintends to keep the CMS vaccine mandate in effect until \\\\nNovember of 2024, especially when we know this policy is \\\\ncontributing to the workforce shortage?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, let me see if I can \\\\naddress your question straight on. COVID is still with us. It \\\\nis not what it was three years ago, but today two to 300 \\\\nAmericans will likely die from COVID. It is still something we \\\\nhave to take into account and protect against.\\\\n    It is worse, and you will remember those days, when you \\\\ncould not even walk into a hospital to visit your relative who \\\\nwas sick with COVID because you could become infected as well.\\\\n    We have to make sure we are protecting each other. And \\\\ncertainly health care workers have to be protected against \\\\nCOVID, and we have to make sure we are protected against health \\\\ncare workers who are treating COVID-infected patients.\\\\n    And it would be irreconcilable to say that a health care \\\\nworker who is around COVID should not be vaccinated to make \\\\nsure that he or she is not inadvertently passing COVID on to \\\\npeople who are not yet infected.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. You just repeated that basically.\\\\n    I would like to now turn to something that will help \\\\nbolster our health care workforce. In 2020, Congress took the \\\\nhistoric step of adding 1,000 new graduate medical education \\\\nslots to train additional physicians for the first time ever.\\\\n    Multiple hospitals in my district utilized the GME Program, \\\\nand I was so encouraged when Congress put guardrails in to \\\\nensure that the slots were distributed to rural areas that face \\\\nacute provider shortage.\\\\n    Can you imagine my dismay when I saw recently that nearly \\\\n20 percent of the GME slots distributed around went to New York \\\\nState alone?\\\\n    Can you commit to the committee that the next round of \\\\ndistribution will better prioritize rural areas?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely, Congresswoman. We will work \\\\nwith you because I have also fretted over this. When I was a \\\\nmember of Congress, I raised this issue of GME.\\\\n    And one of the issues and perhaps for those of you who are \\\\nin rural parts of the country, it is nearly impossible to get \\\\nany of these GME slots because rarely do you find any of the \\\\nmedical schools located in rural America. So we have to figure \\\\nout how to get some of these training slots because oftentimes \\\\nwhere you train is where you end up living and practicing.\\\\n    And so we need to make sure we are directing some of these \\\\nfuture doctors to communities like rural America where there is \\\\na shortage of them.\\\\n    Mrs. MILLER. We have three wonderful medical schools in \\\\nWest Virginia.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back my time.\\\\n    Now, Ms. DelBene.\\\\n    Ms. DelBENE. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being with us today. It is \\\\ngreat to see you.\\\\n    I first want to commend you for working to improve prior \\\\nauthorization for seniors on Medicare Advantage. I partnered \\\\nwith Congressman Kelly for years to make this archaic process \\\\nfully electronic and streamlined so seniors can get the care \\\\nthat they deserve faster and so providers are not buried in \\\\npaperwork.\\\\n    The last Congress we passed our legislation through the \\\\nHouse with unanimous bipartisan support, a rare thing.\\\\n    In line with our legislation, I appreciate HHS&#x27; proposed \\\\nrules to improve prior authorization, and I would like to \\\\nhighlight your agency&#x27;s detailed economic analysis, which found \\\\nthat these policies would save physician practices and \\\\nhospitals over 200 million hours in administrative time over a \\\\nten-year period.\\\\n    That means a total cost savings of $15 billion. So as you \\\\nwork to finalize these rules, I encourage you to require real \\\\ntime prior authorization decisions for routinely approved \\\\nservices, and faster time frames when there is an emergency. So \\\\nplease keep that in mind.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely will.\\\\n    Ms. DelBENE. Now I want to turn to another important issue. \\\\nMore than 37 million Americans live with kidney disease, \\\\nincluding more than 800,000 with kidney failure for which there \\\\nis no cure.\\\\n    Although some are lucky enough to receive a transplant, \\\\nmost Americans starting dialysis will die within five years. \\\\nThat includes over 13,000 people who have kidney failure in my \\\\nhome State of Washington.\\\\n    Medicare spent $150 billion last year just on kidney \\\\ndiseases. That is over 18 percent of Medicare&#x27;s overall budget. \\\\nYet the core technologies to treat and care for people living \\\\nwith kidney failure have not advanced much over the past 50 \\\\nyears.\\\\n    So I am a strong supporter of the KidneyX Program, which is \\\\nspeeding up the development of new treatments, particularly for \\\\nthe world&#x27;s first artificial kidney. In January, along with my \\\\ncolleagues in the bipartisan and bicameral colleagues in the \\\\nKidney Caucus, I wrote the Administration a letter requesting \\\\nan increase in funding to $25 million, up from $5 million, for \\\\nKidneyX, a very humble request.\\\\n    I have sent similar letters in previous years.\\\\n    Unfortunately, the President&#x27;s budget continues to keep \\\\nfunding flat for this critical program. This funding increase \\\\nis important, a small and yet very, very important investment \\\\nthat would be relatively or especially compared to the current \\\\ncost of treating kidney failure.\\\\n    Unlocking new treatment options would be life changing for \\\\npeople with this condition and would significantly improve the \\\\nphysical health of Medicare over the long term.\\\\n    So when KidneyX was created, there was an expectation of \\\\n$125 million from the private sector and $125 million from the \\\\nFederal Government, and we are not meeting our end of the \\\\nbargain.\\\\n    So given the success of KidneyX in its first three years \\\\nand the President&#x27;s commitment to preserve Medicare for the \\\\nnext generation, why is the Administration not doing more to \\\\nprioritize this program, which could provide a revolutionary \\\\nreturn on investment?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, first thank you for \\\\nchampioning KidneyX and for being such a proponent.\\\\n    I think you would find so many people at HHS who would \\\\nsupport what you have just said. We do have to do what we can \\\\nwith the monies that we have. We are limited.\\\\n    And whether it is kidney, I was answering questions in a \\\\nprevious hearing on asthma and how we should do more on asthma. \\\\nWe are not going to say we cannot do more or should not do \\\\nmore. We just need more resources.\\\\n    And so I will put it back to you and say we look forward to \\\\nworking with you so you all can get us more money so we can do \\\\nmore with KidneyX.\\\\n    Ms. DelBENE. This is a huge cost to Medicare right now so I \\\\nhope we can make an increase in its investment.\\\\n    Thank you so much.\\\\n    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH [presiding]. The gentleman from North \\\\nCarolina is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Secretary, for coming.\\\\n    I want to just follow up on one of my colleagues&#x27; comments \\\\nearlier, Dr. Wenstrup. I personally also as a physician, we \\\\nsent you all a bipartisan, bicameral bill signed by a President \\\\nfor the No Surprises Act, and you absolutely took it to the \\\\nleft and have hurt, I believe, Americans.\\\\n    And you talk about all of the disputes that occurred. \\\\nAbsolutely, because it was not interpreted as it was sent over. \\\\nI will just leave that as a comment.\\\\n    The one thing that you and I definitely will agree on is \\\\nthe antimicrobial resistance. I have lost patients. I have seen \\\\nI think the record is now about 35,000 a year that die because \\\\nwe do not have drugs to treat them.\\\\n    I know you probably know some of this, but just for the \\\\nedification of some of the other members, from the time it \\\\nstarts, when a drug starts from the beginning to a patented \\\\nmolecule sometimes takes ten, 15 even longer, that many years, \\\\nand it costs billions of dollars of investment.\\\\n    And for every one molecule that passes through, there are \\\\nprobably about 100 to 150 that do not make it.\\\\n    From the time they patent a molecule, it gets a 14-year \\\\nclock. However, now that 14-year clock has changed to nine \\\\nyears, and as a direct result of that, so many pharmaceutical \\\\ncompanies because they cannot--and I am not advocating for \\\\npharmaceutical companies. I am advocating for patients.\\\\n    So many pharmaceutical companies have because of that \\\\nrestriction of their ability to earn and recoup their losses \\\\nare stopping production, and for the record, Mr. Chairman, I \\\\nwould like to submit an article, as well as source, of a list \\\\nof 42 companies that have mentioned the IRA this year and \\\\ndelayed launches of their medications, impacts to long-term \\\\nplanning for new cures, and impacts to oncology R&amp;D.\\\\n    May I just submit these for the record, sir?\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Without objection, so ordered.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]   \\\\n   \\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. And so we go back to the antimicrobial \\\\nresistance. We really have not had a new generation come along. \\\\nWe have had it in the quinolones and there are some fifth \\\\ngeneration cephalosporins that are helping.\\\\n    How can the IRA and then with the fact that Biden wants to \\\\nhave the moonshot program and develop these new cancer cures, \\\\nhow can that fit with the fact now that we are killing American \\\\nR&amp;D and trying to develop new cures because we are cutting \\\\ntheir ability to actually fund for them?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, here is my difficulty in \\\\nfollowing the logic of your question. If a company----\\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. I think I was pretty clear. It calls for \\\\nsomebody to develop drugs who are cutting them out from earning \\\\nthat money so they will not develop the drugs.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. And if they are putting that drug out \\\\nthere on a competitive price, what would be the problem?\\\\n    It is when you put a drug out there for an uncompetitive \\\\nprice, where you essentially charge Americans two to three \\\\ntimes more than what you charge others around the world, that \\\\nis what the Inflation Reduction Act attacks. It lets us \\\\nnegotiate to get the best price.\\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. Well, tell that to the 42 companies now.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I would say that to the 42 companies.\\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. That have stopped production of cures and \\\\ntreatments, which include antibiotics.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Competition should not stop anyone from \\\\ntrying to develop a drug.\\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. I am not pleading for pharmaceutical profits. \\\\nPlease do not take me that way.\\\\n    But I am saying it costs billions of dollars to do this, \\\\nand now we have 42 companies that say they are not going to do \\\\nit because if the IRA.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. And how those 42 companies can make a \\\\ndecision on a law that just took effect and that will not be \\\\nnegotiating prices for several years to come is beyond me.\\\\n    But what I can tell you is----\\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. That is planning in corporate America. That is \\\\nplanning. You have to plan 20 years for these drugs. That is \\\\nhow long it takes for these drugs to come out.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. And you are entitled to plan to make a \\\\nprofit. You are just not entitled to gouge Americans for the--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. I agree 100 percent. I agree 100 percent.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So why would the companies not want to \\\\ncreate a drug in America, the richest country in the world, so \\\\nthey could sell it and make a profit, not gouge, but make a \\\\nprofit?\\\\n    Mr. MURPHY. Because their timeline to make that profit has \\\\nbeen cut by 30 percent.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. KUSTOFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for appearing today.\\\\n    I want to ask you about a New York Times article dated \\\\nFebruary 25, 2023, the headline, ``Alone and Exploited Migrant \\\\nChildren Work Brutal Jobs Across the U.S. Arriving in record \\\\nnumbers, they are ending up in dangerous jobs that violate \\\\nchild labor laws, including in factories that make products for \\\\nwell known brands like Cheetos and Fruit of the Loom.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    The article talks about migrant children have been coming \\\\ninto the United States without their parents in record numbers, \\\\nare ending up in some of the most punishing jobs in the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    A New York Times investigation found, it says, 12-year-old \\\\ngroupers in Florida and in Tennessee. The article goes on to \\\\nsay that the number of unaccompanied minors entering the United \\\\nStates climbed to a record 130,000 last year, three times what \\\\nit was five years earlier, and this summer is expected to bring \\\\nanother wave.\\\\n    The Federal Government knows they are in the United States, \\\\nand the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible \\\\nfor ensuring sponsors will support them and protect them from \\\\ntrafficking or exploitation.\\\\n    But as more and more children have arrived, the Biden White \\\\nHouse has ramped up demand on staffers to move the children \\\\nquickly out of shelters and releasee them to adults. Case \\\\nworkers say they rushed them through vetting sponsors.\\\\n    While HHS checks on all minors by calling them a month \\\\nafter they begin living with their sponsors, data obtained by \\\\nthe Times showed that over the last two years the agency could \\\\nnot reach more than 85,000 children.\\\\n    Overall the agency lost contact with a third of migrant \\\\nchildren.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, is the New York Times correct that HHS \\\\ncannot account for 85,000 migrant children in the U.S.?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, no, they are not.\\\\n    Mr. KUSTOFF. Okay. What is the number then, Mr. Secretary?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. You have to understand the \\\\nresponsibility that HHS has. We do a follow-up check on these \\\\nmigrant children by contacting the children and their sponsors, \\\\nbut our authority that Congress gave us goes toward caring for \\\\nthe child while they are in our custody.\\\\n    Once they are in the custody of those sponsors, we do not \\\\nhave jurisdiction over the children.\\\\n    And so for the New York Times to say that we lost contact \\\\nwith them, it is not that we lost contact. We try to make an \\\\neffort to follow up with them, but they are under no obligation \\\\nto respond to us, neither the child nor the sponsor.\\\\n    And so the New York Time could have done a little bit more \\\\nhomework to figure out what HHS&#x27; responsibilities truly are.\\\\n    Mr. KUSTOFF. All right. Let me ask this because the article \\\\nspecifically says the agency cannot reach more than 85,000 \\\\nchildren. You are saying that is an incorrect statement.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. That is an incorrect statement.\\\\n    Mr. KUSTOFF. And you do or do not know what that actual \\\\nnumber is?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I can tell you the number of children \\\\nthat we have placed in the care of sponsors, and every one of \\\\nthose children we follow up with.\\\\n    Mr. KUSTOFF. What is the number of children that you do not \\\\nhave contact with?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, as I just explained, we no \\\\nlonger have jurisdiction over the children once they are placed \\\\nin the care. You did not give us the authority to keep in \\\\ncontact with those kids.\\\\n    Mr. KUSTOFF. You do not know what the number of children is \\\\nthat you do not have contact with, correct?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We make contact. We try to make contact \\\\nwith every child that has been in our care that we place in the \\\\nhands of a sponsor.\\\\n    Mr. KUSTOFF. Thank you.\\\\n    My time has expired. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The representative from California, Ms. \\\\nChu, is recognized.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Secretary Becerra, I wanted to thank you so much \\\\nfor your visit to my district in Monterey Park, California, \\\\nlast month. The visit meant so much to the people of Monterey \\\\nPark who are still reeling from the mass shooting that took 11 \\\\nlives in January.\\\\n    The shooter was a person who was deteriorating mentally, \\\\nwho should not have had a gun but did, and did terrible harm.\\\\n    The wide availability of guns in the wrong hands has \\\\nyielded a drastic increase in gun violence deaths, as AEPI \\\\nyouth, in fact, have the fastest growing firearm suicide rate \\\\nof any racial or ethnic group, which is a 71 percent increase \\\\nin the last decade.\\\\n    Because of this I will soon be releasing legislation to \\\\nensure that all communities, including limited English \\\\nproficient and immigrant communities, have access to gun safety \\\\nand prevention strategies, such as safe gun storage \\\\nrecommendations and mental health services for suicide \\\\nprevention that are recommended by CDC.\\\\n    One part of the President&#x27;s budget that is so important is \\\\nan increase of $50 million for the suicide prevention program \\\\nto expand CDC&#x27;s work to reduce suicide.\\\\n    How will you ensure that this important research and safety \\\\nguidance will be accessible to these LEP and immigrant \\\\ncommunities?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, first, that was a special \\\\nvisit. As you know, I used to live in Monterey Park. I still \\\\nhave a home there, and you could see it in so many of the \\\\npeople&#x27;s expressions, how not just painful, but how \\\\nappreciative they were when anyone would give them a chance to \\\\njust speak their mind.\\\\n    And speak their mind is important for your point because \\\\noftentimes they are not able to communicate with authorities \\\\nbecause they do not converse easily in English.\\\\n    We are doing everything we can to make sure that we provide \\\\nculturally and linguistically appropriate services. The \\\\nmaterials, we try to translate them into appropriate languages. \\\\nThe people we hire, we want them to not only know different \\\\nlanguages, but also have lived experiences that relate to the \\\\npeople that we are trying to help, and in so many ways we will \\\\ntry to support the work that you are doing to make sure that we \\\\nare approaching people with services that accommodate their \\\\nneeds.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you so much.\\\\n    I would like to have your comments on Title 10 and \\\\nMedicaid. You know, Title 10 family planning has been flatlined \\\\nfor the last ten years, and yet the need is greater than ever \\\\nnow.\\\\n    So I commend you and the Biden Administration for proposing \\\\n$512 million for the Title 10 Family Planning Program, the \\\\nfirst increase since 2014.\\\\n    And then there is the Medicaid unwinding, the continuous \\\\ncoverage requirements, you know, started during COVID, but \\\\nunwinding this Friday, and millions could lose coverage.\\\\n    So can you speak to the importance of Title 10 and also how \\\\ndoes the department plan to protect those most vulnerable to \\\\nlosing coverage once Medicaid unwinding begins?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, we have been in \\\\nconversations with governors throughout the country to make \\\\nsure that they are aware of what is coming once the public \\\\nhealth emergency comes down. We want to make sure that no \\\\nAmerican loses health coverage because the public health \\\\nemergency has ceased.\\\\n    And we continue to work with States. Some are better \\\\npositioned than others. Some are doing more than others, but \\\\nevery State is aware that there are a number of individuals--so \\\\nit could be close to 14, 15, up to 16 million Americans--who \\\\ncould lose their coverage even though they qualify for other \\\\ncoverage, whether it is through the Affordable Care Act or \\\\nwhether it is through existing Medicaid programs where if they \\\\nreapply, they will still qualify.\\\\n    And we want to make sure everyone is aware that that is \\\\navailable to them, including employer insurance, which maybe \\\\nthey did not have when COVID hit and they got onto Medicaid but \\\\nnow they are employed and they have access to coverage. They \\\\nneed to know those things so we do not lose coverage for those \\\\nAmericans.\\\\n    Ms. CHU. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Ms. Van Duyne from Texas is recognized.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And thank you, Secretary for being here today.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, as you know, the Hospice Care Program is a \\\\nvital part of the health care system, with over 50 percent of \\\\nMedicare patients utilizing the program.\\\\n    But it is also one of the hardest realities that a family \\\\ncan endure. We know how personal this issue is for you as you \\\\nand your family provided for your father excellent end-of-life \\\\ncare.\\\\n    But not everyone is as lucky. The system had been overrun \\\\nwith rampant fraud and abuse, and your agency&#x27;s responses to \\\\nthe crisis has been extremely alarming. We have been told just \\\\nlast week to, quote, ``be patient&#x27;&#x27; while CMS investigates.\\\\n    But families only have one chance to provide excellent end-\\\\nof-life care for loved ones, and while CMS asks for patience, \\\\nmore and more fraudulent Hospice providers are gaming the \\\\nsystem. They are stealing Medicare dollars, assessing opioid \\\\nmedication, and depriving patients of access to the care that \\\\nthey need.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I ask for unanimous consent to enter into the \\\\nrecord the ProPublica article entitled ``End Game, How the \\\\nVisionary Hospice Movement Became a Nonprofit Hustle.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Without objection, so ordered.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. So, Mr. Secretary, we are well beyond the \\\\ntime to be patient and the time for action is now. Families \\\\ndeserve more from this Administration.\\\\n    We have a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including my \\\\ncolleague from Oregon, Mr. Blumenauer, ready to address this \\\\nissue.\\\\n    And, Mr. Secretary, you served as a member of Congress \\\\nrepresenting Los Angeles County and on this committee at a time \\\\nwhen your district was seeing an increase in fraudulent Hospice \\\\nactivity.\\\\n    You also served as the Attorney General of California as \\\\nthis crisis continued to build. Now you are HHS Secretary. How \\\\ncan we trust that you are finally going to take this issue \\\\nseriously?\\\\n    Will you review how penalties actually prevent fraud?\\\\n    And when can we honest to God expect an answer from CMS on \\\\nwhat is going on?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So, Congresswoman, I am surprised you \\\\ndid not get the answer that you wanted from CMS, and we can \\\\nactually follow up if you would like with CMS.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. That would be great.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. But they are not sitting around. We are \\\\nacting aggressively. In fact, in this budget we are asking for \\\\nmoney to do exactly that, to go after the fraud and the abuse \\\\nthat is going on.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. And I appreciate that you are doing this, \\\\nand I know. Look. We have three and a half minutes because you \\\\nlimited your time in front of this committee. I will be \\\\nfollowing up with requesting a legitimate answer in writing \\\\nfrom your office.\\\\n    Now, I know that you actually do have a history of not \\\\nresponding to our requests for information from this committee. \\\\nSo I am going to ask you will you commit to answering my \\\\nquestions which will be submitted for the record regarding \\\\nHospice care?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Having been a former member of Congress \\\\nand made requests for answers in writing,----\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Is that a yes?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA [continuing]. We make every effort to \\\\nmake sure we respond----\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I want to turn to a completely different topic, Mr. \\\\nSecretary. Approximately 100 facilities nationwide, also known \\\\nas pediatric transgender clinics, are performing gender-\\\\naffirming treatment in the form of hormone therapy and surgery \\\\non children at age 11 or younger.\\\\n    There are even allegations that some of these clinics \\\\nperform these treatments without conducting thorough mental \\\\nhealth assessments beforehand or even bypassing certain \\\\nparental consent.\\\\n    Ten States have now restricted these treatments for \\\\nchildren including eight States that ban this treatment for \\\\nchildren outright.\\\\n    Are you aware of any medical facilities conducting \\\\npediatric gender-affirming treatment that either receive HHS \\\\ngrants or Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, there are a number of \\\\nfacilities that could receive funding from HHS so long as it is \\\\na federally prescribed service, and so therefore, we would make \\\\nsure that they are using the monies appropriately.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. So, Mr. Secretary, can you confirm that \\\\nthese facilities, none of them are using a dime of Federal \\\\ntaxpayer dollars to provide pediatric gender-affirming \\\\ntreatments to children?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, those facilities are \\\\nunder law required to make sure they are using any federally \\\\nprovided money in the appropriate----\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. They are or they are not providing that \\\\nservice?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Now you are asking me about every \\\\nfacility in the country. I can tell you that CMS has an \\\\nobligation to make sure that we are doing oversight. If you \\\\nhelp us with our budget----\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Okay. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA [continuing]. We will do as much as we \\\\ncan.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. \\\\nFitzpatrick, is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being with us today.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, my constituent Phil Guttes was diagnosed \\\\nwith early onset Alzheimer&#x27;s seven years ago. He received this \\\\ndiagnosis as part of a clinical trial for Aducanumab, a drug, \\\\nand has been on this drug for almost I would say probably the \\\\nlast seven years or so.\\\\n    He will receive two more infusions as part of this trial, \\\\nand then because of the discriminatory and unprecedented \\\\ndecision by CMS not to cover this drug and FDA-approved drugs \\\\nlike it, he will be faced with either wiping out his retirement \\\\nsavings to pay for the drug on his own, outside of Medicare, or \\\\ngo without treatment altogether.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, never before, to my knowledge, has CMS \\\\nrefused to provide coverage for an FDA-approved drug. So my \\\\nquestion: what does the Administration have to say to the \\\\nmillions of patients, caregivers and families who will be \\\\ndenied access to these breakthrough treatments, like my \\\\nconstituent Phil, many other people like him across America?\\\\n    And what is the Administration doing to ensure that access \\\\nto these FDA-approved drugs will be provided to our seniors?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, I would say to those \\\\nindividuals what my wife and I said to our own family members \\\\nwho, when we were experiencing these same issues of dementia, \\\\nAlzheimer&#x27;s, and that is we are going to work together. We will \\\\ndo everything now, and as the Secretary, I will do everything \\\\nwe can to make sure that lifesaving treatments are made \\\\navailable whether it is first through FDA, which has to ensure \\\\nthat a drug can be put out onto the market safely and \\\\neffectively, or whether it is through CMS, which has to make \\\\nsure that for purposes of Medicare, that it is a drug that will \\\\nget coverage under the Medicare Program.\\\\n    But I will say it, as Secretary as I would say it as the \\\\nfather or the son-in-law or as the son of those who might be \\\\naffected by these types of illnesses, that we will do \\\\neverything we can to make sure that we are providing the care \\\\nthat they need.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. Well, see, everything you can, and it is \\\\nyour decision, your purview of your department----\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK [continuing]. Regarding the decision of CMS \\\\nto refuse to provide coverage for this medication.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, we apply the laws that you \\\\npass, and the laws require Medicare services to go through a \\\\ncertain type of check. We have to abide by that law.\\\\n    The law that governs CMS is different from the law that \\\\ngoverns FDA. If you wish to wish to have the law that governs \\\\nCMS be the same as the law that governs FDA, then it is up to \\\\nyou to make that change.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. Lastly, Mr. Secretary, I have a question \\\\nwhich is going to extend beyond my time. So, Mr. Chairman, I \\\\nask unanimous consent to enter this question into the record \\\\nregarding the effect of GPOs and PBMs on drug shortages and \\\\ndrug prices.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Without objection.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. And, Mr. Secretary, if I could get your \\\\ncommitment to a timely response to this question that we enter.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We will make every effort to respond as \\\\nquickly as we can, Congressman.\\\\n    Mr. FITZPATRICK. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Representative.\\\\n    I recognize the lady, the gentlelady from Wisconsin, Ms. \\\\nMoore.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And I, too, want to thank you, Secretary Becerra for coming \\\\nto my district and really doing an amazing job to educate my \\\\ncommunity about the importance of the various investments that \\\\nhave been made in our community.\\\\n    Just very quickly, I am looking at your written testimony, \\\\nand on page 5, you said, ``The budget also proposes to further \\\\nexpand the health care workforce by allowing community health \\\\nworkers to be able to bill for select services under \\\\nMedicare.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Can you share with me what those might be? That is very \\\\nexciting.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I am sorry. Can you pose the question--\\\\n--\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Your written testimony says that \\\\nyou are going to allow community health workers to be able to \\\\nbill for select services under Medicare.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We are trying to move both the Medicare \\\\nProgram and the Medicaid Program to a space where we make \\\\naccess to services more readily available because one of the \\\\nthings we found, Congresswoman, is too often people are \\\\ndeprived of services even though they are eligible for them \\\\nbecause they do not know how to access them.\\\\n    And so whether it is in Medicare or Medicaid, we are going \\\\nto do everything we can to make sure access is being most \\\\navailable.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\\\n    I am so pleased to see this. This is like a dream come true \\\\nto look at a budget that is really centered around children and \\\\nwomen, and I do not have enough time to address everything, but \\\\nI was curious about the foster care provision that just came \\\\nonboard in January 2023 that would enable foster youth to have \\\\nMedicaid through age 26.\\\\n    And I am concerned about the implementation of that \\\\nprogram, whether or not there is a sort of plan to contact \\\\nfoster youth who may or may not know that if aged out of foster \\\\ncare, that they are still eligible for Medicaid.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes, that is one of the biggest issues, \\\\nis when you leave the foster care program, sometimes there is \\\\nno safety net to catch you.\\\\n    We are going to try to do what we can to follow up. Simply \\\\nbecause you turn a particular age, 19, 21, depending on what it \\\\nis, it should not mean that all of a sudden you fall over a \\\\ncliff when it comes to the services that you need.\\\\n    Foster kids, as you know, are the most in need of service. \\\\nThey are the ones that are calling the 988 suicide prevention \\\\nhotline----\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Exactly.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA [continuing]. More often than not.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Exactly.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So we are going to do everything we can \\\\nto make sure no foster care child believes that they are second \\\\nclass.\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. I am really happy to see that you \\\\nare very intentional about moving into mental health.\\\\n    And you know, we talk about mental health parity all the \\\\ntime, at least as long as I have been a member of Congress, and \\\\nso I am wondering what in particular that we wrap our arms \\\\naround are you doing to make sure that mental health parity is \\\\nmore than just a conversation?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, we are doing as much as \\\\nwe can to get insurance companies to follow the law, and so \\\\nthat if you are an insurance company, you provide reimbursement \\\\nfor physical health care, benefits and services that a patient \\\\nreceives, that you are also providing reimbursement for mental \\\\nhealth services in an----\\\\n    Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. This is a really big problem. I \\\\nmean, women postpartum have severe depression, and it has a \\\\nreal impact on the wellbeing of the entire family.\\\\n    You know, when Mama ain&#x27;t okay, nobody is okay.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Steube, is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    On January 30th of this year, a Corcoran Report was \\\\nreleased, and it found that for, and I quote, ``medical and \\\\nsurgical masks,&#x27;&#x27; and a separate analysis for N95 P2 \\\\nrespirators, and I quote again, ``Compared with wearing no mask \\\\nin the community studies, only wearing a mask may have little \\\\nto no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness \\\\nor COVID-like illness.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Are you aware of the analysis that I am referencing?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, I have heard of a lot of \\\\nanalyses. I know that at the end of the day wearing a mask has \\\\nhelped keep Americans alive.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Well, not according to the Corcoran.\\\\n    The medical and surgical mask analysis reviewed nine \\\\nstudies in over 276,000 people. The N95 P2 analysis reviewed \\\\nfive studies in over 8,400 people.\\\\n    But then on March 10th, Corcoran put out a statement noting \\\\nthat their analysis was actually inconclusive and that the \\\\nexact quote from their analysis that I just read was, quote, \\\\n``misleading&#x27;&#x27; after they had just found all of that based on \\\\nall of those studies.\\\\n    So it is clear that somebody in the Administration or \\\\nsomebody somewhere influence Corcoran&#x27;s attempt to back-tread \\\\nfrom their previous findings three months prior.\\\\n    So my first question is is it true that you had \\\\nconversations with Corcoran regarding their January findings \\\\nafter their report was released?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. If your ``you&#x27;&#x27; refers to me, that is \\\\nnot true.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Okay. Did anyone acting on behalf of HHS \\\\ncontact Corcoran about their January 30 findings after their \\\\nreport?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Best I know, no, but I can try to find \\\\nout if you would like.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So would you be willing to give any documents \\\\nor correspondence that anybody in your agency had with Corcoran \\\\nbetween January and March 10th of this year?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We will provide to you whatever \\\\ndocuments are disclosable by law.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Okay. I will put that into a letter.\\\\n    Is it true that someone from HHS or the Biden \\\\nAdministration pressured Corcoran to change or back away from \\\\ntheir January 30 findings?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I know nothing of that ever happening.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So you are not aware, but you are saying that \\\\nyou are not aware that somebody in the agency may have had \\\\nconversations with them?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. As far as I know, I know of no one in \\\\nthe agency who engaged in that kind of a conversation.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. And your testimony here today is that you would \\\\nbe willing to provide correspondence between anybody in HHS \\\\nwith Corcoran after January of this year, after the findings?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We are prepared to provide you with \\\\nwhatever documents legally you are eligible to request.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Okay. Has HHS ever contacted social media \\\\nplatforms, such as Twitter or Facebook, to pressure them to \\\\nremove statements about COVID-19 that the Administration did \\\\nnot want circulated?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I believe now you are making reference \\\\nto some lawsuits that sort of make those kinds of allegations, \\\\nbut I can say to you that I am not aware of anything like that, \\\\nat least not from me.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So you have not had any conversations with any \\\\nsocial medica platforms about anything related to COVID and the \\\\ninformation that they are putting out to the American public?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Other than perhaps using some of these \\\\nplatforms to put out information.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So you have had conversations with social media \\\\nplatforms as it relates to putting out information?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I have put out information on some of \\\\nthese social media platforms. I have not had conversations with \\\\nthe representatives or the leaderships of these platforms \\\\ntrying to influence them to do one thing or the other.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. So your testimony is that you put things on \\\\nplatforms, but you have not had conversations with executives \\\\nor anybody at Twitter or Facebook or otherwise.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Now you are stretching it. Have I ever \\\\nhad conversations----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Well, I am following up on your testimony.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So the answer is there may have been \\\\noccasions for me to have conversations with executives from any \\\\nof those media platforms on any number of subjects.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Did Surgeon General Vivek Murthy participate in \\\\nmeetings with White House officials and social media company \\\\nofficials discussing what information should be hidden from the \\\\npublic?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I suggest you ask Surgeon General----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Are you aware of any conversations that they \\\\nhad?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I know that he has conversations with \\\\nlots of entities and individuals, but I could not specify if in \\\\nthis particular case----\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. I&#x27;m asking if you are aware that he had \\\\nconversations with those social media platforms.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I am not aware.\\\\n    Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to add to \\\\nthe record the Corcoran Library analysis, Physical \\\\nInterventions to Interrupt or Reduce the Spread of Respiratory \\\\nViruses, and the Corcoran three months&#x27; later statement on \\\\nphysical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of \\\\nrespiratory viruses.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Without objection, so ordered.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Representative from New York, Ms. Tenney, \\\\nis recognized.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Thank you, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member \\\\nNeal, for holding this important meeting.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for testifying before the \\\\ncommittee.\\\\n    Over the past couple of years, many of us have shared \\\\nnumerous concerns about the Department of Health and Human \\\\nServices prioritizing politics over its duty to promote and \\\\nprotect the health and welfare of the American people. This has \\\\nincluded HHS&#x27; insistence to keep the unscientific CMS health \\\\ncare workforce COVID-19 vaccine mandate, referenced by my \\\\ncolleague from New York, Mr. Higgins, which has exacerbated \\\\nhealth care staffing shortages, especially in rural districts \\\\nlike my own in Upstate New York.\\\\n    The department has also spent time altering Medicare \\\\npayments to re-incentivize doctors to develop anti-racism \\\\nplans, for example, instead of boosting health quality care or \\\\nhealth care quality for all patients.\\\\n    At the same time, HHS has failed to properly implement \\\\nbipartisan surprise medical billing provisions passed by \\\\nCongress or reform its guidance to allow seniors to access new, \\\\ninnovative treatment for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, as my colleagues \\\\nhave referenced.\\\\n    But I want to jump right into this issue about vaccine \\\\nmandates if I could, Mr. Secretary. Over the past few years, \\\\nmultiple scientific studies have found that the COVID-19 \\\\nvaccines do not reduce transmission of the virus. In fact, our \\\\nown CDC Director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, she is a Doctor of \\\\nMedicine, unlike you and I who are doctor of laws.\\\\n    She said in referencing the COVID-19 vaccine, what they \\\\ncannot do anymore is prevent transmission.\\\\n    So you just stated in your testimony today that the reason \\\\nwe are extending this vaccine mandate, especially on health \\\\ncare workers, until November of 2024 is because of the \\\\ntransmission of the disease.\\\\n    This is causing huge problems in Upstate New York in terms \\\\nof staffing, as I indicated. In the Finger Lakes Region and \\\\nBuffalo Region, which I share with Mr. Higgins, hospitals have \\\\nhad a 375 percent increase in contract labor costs due partly \\\\nbecause of the vaccine mandate, having to hire visiting nurses, \\\\nwhich are much more costly.\\\\n    There have been protests, and a lot of objections to this \\\\nvaccine mandate, particularly among nurses and those heroes who \\\\nserved when we did not have a vaccine, who now have been laid \\\\noff and lost their jobs.\\\\n    And we think this is unsustainable. What are your plans \\\\nunder CMS--and I know you have indicated to my colleague, Mrs. \\\\nMiller from West Virginia; what are your plans in dealing with \\\\nthis vaccine mandate now that we know that this is not \\\\ntransmissionable by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, our CDC Director?\\\\n    Would you be willing to overturn this vaccine mandate \\\\nearlier so that we could get people back to work in New York \\\\nand really provide the health care we owe to our patients?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, thank you for the question.\\\\n    And as has always been the case, and you can----\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Can you just answer would you be willing to do \\\\nthat? Because I want to also add a New York judge actually just \\\\nstruck down the vaccine mandate in January.\\\\n    So is this something you are willing to do to override this \\\\nbased on the law and also based on science?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. The actions are taken based on science \\\\nand the evidence, and that will continue to be the case.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. So Dr. Walensky is not accurate as a doctor in \\\\ndetermining that these vaccines do not transmit the disease?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So I am not sure about the quote that \\\\nyou attribute to her, but what I could tell you is that Dr. \\\\nWalensky, like all of those who are working on COVID within the \\\\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, base their actions on \\\\nscience and the evidence.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Would you be willing to waive Novak Djokovic&#x27;s \\\\nentry into the United States to play in the U.S. Open, tennis.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So you give me more power than I have, \\\\nauthority than I have. Those are not----\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. You oversee the CDC?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. CDC does not make the decision about who \\\\ncan come in and cannot come in. Those are issues that----\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. They could issue the waiver.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I&#x27;m sorry?\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. The waiver could be issued.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. A waiver for one individual?\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. For anyone, anyone that is coming in. I mean, \\\\nwe have illegal immigrants crossing our border every single day \\\\nwho do not actually take the vaccine.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We provide the vaccine to those \\\\nunaccompanied migrant children who do come into the country, \\\\nyes.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. And what about American citizens who choose to \\\\nplay in these sports that do not take the vaccine? They are \\\\nwaived from coming in.\\\\n    Are they dangerous to the----\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. American citizens are able----\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Is that science?\\\\n    I mean, I am just saying, I mean, we allow American \\\\ncitizens unvaccinated to play in the U.S. Open. So is that \\\\nscientific? Should we mandate that they are vaccinated in order \\\\nto play in sporting events, for example?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. The actions that our Administration has \\\\ntaken with regard to American citizens is to protect them as \\\\nbest possible against COVID. The actions we take with regard to \\\\nthose trying to enter the country are somewhat similar, but \\\\nthere are some differences because these are folks who are \\\\nasking for permission to come into the U.S.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. Would you not say that the decisions are \\\\npolitical at this point?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. The decision is based on science and the \\\\nevidence.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. We need to move on.\\\\n    Ms. TENNEY. My time is up. My time has expired.\\\\n    Thank you very much.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Kildee, is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. KILDEE. Thank you, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member \\\\nNeal, for holding this hearing.\\\\n    And thank you, Secretary Becerra, for being here this \\\\nmorning and, in particular, for discussing the proposed 2024 \\\\nbudget. You and I served together here in this body. I consider \\\\nyou a friend, and I am glad to have you here with us, and I \\\\nappreciate you addressing some of these issues.\\\\n    I am pleased with the priorities that I--have seen come \\\\nforth in the aspect of the budget that you have responsibility \\\\nfor. I am particularly pleased that the budget includes $5 \\\\nmillion for the Flint lead registry, which as you know is a \\\\npowerful tool to help improve the lives of kids and families \\\\nthat I represent in my hometown of Flint that have been exposed \\\\nto lead contaminated water, and I do appreciate this being a \\\\npriority for the department.\\\\n    Because Mr. Kustoff raised it, I want to give you an \\\\nopportunity to address some of the work that you are doing on \\\\nthis issue of child labor violations.\\\\n    I know that you most recently have stood up a task force to \\\\naddress this issue. It is a serious issue. It is one that we \\\\nhave to take seriously, and you know, Mr. Kustoff raised this \\\\nissue as I have with you privately in the past.\\\\n    We do know that this is really a question of your \\\\nauthority, but even to the extent that you do have some \\\\nauthority, it is also an issue of resources. And that is why I \\\\nam happy to see $39.4 billion for the Department of Health and \\\\nHuman Services, Administration for Children and Families in the \\\\nPresident&#x27;s budget.\\\\n    It is ATF that works to protect the wellbeing of \\\\nunaccompanied children by assessing the placements that they \\\\nwill be placed in connection with the other resources that they \\\\nwill be provided.\\\\n    And because a budget decision affects what you are able to \\\\ndo, I wonder if you might just tell us how cuts, which I do \\\\nbelieve some would advocate for, cuts to the Department of \\\\nHealth and Human Services Department&#x27;s Administration for \\\\nChildren and Families would impact your ability, even given the \\\\nauthority that you have to protect children from exploitation.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Well, Congressman, that is a broad \\\\nquestion, but what I can tell you is if we lose some of the \\\\nfunding we have within the Administration for Children and \\\\nFamilies, we would have less opportunity to provide the child \\\\ncare services support, the Head Start services support, to be \\\\nable to with regard specifically to the refugee program and \\\\nwithin that the Unaccompanied Migrant Kids Program, be able to \\\\nprovide the level of custody care that we provide.\\\\n    And so you impact kids in so many different ways, and as I \\\\nsay, children are children, and whether they are your children, \\\\nmy children, in this country we should let children be treated \\\\nas children.\\\\n    Mr. KILDEE. Thank you, and I ask finally do you know, and I \\\\nhope you do, that the Administration would support my efforts \\\\nto increase the civil and criminal penalties for employers?\\\\n    Because look. We need to hold people responsible for this. \\\\nYou know, you have some regulatory authority, but employers \\\\nhave a responsibility. Those employers who are illegally hiring \\\\nchildren in dangerous jobs need to face stiffer criminal and \\\\ncivil penalties.\\\\n    And I ask if the Administration would support our effort to \\\\ndo just that.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. You hit it right on the money, \\\\nCongressman. If an employer, if a company was not willing to \\\\nhire against the law these children, we would not see the type \\\\nof exploitation, and that is the heart of this. We should not \\\\nbe allowing this to happen right in front of us.\\\\n    Mr. KILDEE. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\\\n    And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you.\\\\n    The gentleman from Utah is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and the Ranking \\\\nMember.\\\\n    Secretary Becerra, thank you for being here today and \\\\nputting in the time to dialogue with us on these issues.\\\\n    This is it. This is the most crucial, most important \\\\nmatters of our Nation, is getting things related to health care \\\\nfigured out. This is something in every single district across \\\\nthe board. So incredibly important.\\\\n    According to a recent estimate, 250,000 Americans die each \\\\nyear due to medical error. This is an issue Congress and CMS \\\\nhave tried to address for decades through quality measure \\\\nactivities.\\\\n    However, a 2019 GAO report noted that CMS failed to \\\\nproperly track its spending on quality measurement activities \\\\nand how its spending is or is not helping it achieve its \\\\nstrategic objectives, such as lowering administrative burdens.\\\\n    We talk a lot about administrative burdens, but sincerely, \\\\nthis is an area that we could truly lower administrative \\\\nburdens. My team and I think that this could be a significant \\\\nwin and a bipartisan win in the 118th Congress.\\\\n    I sent you a letter yesterday asking five detailed \\\\nquestions on this topic.\\\\n    Will you commit to answering these questions in my letter \\\\nby the end of April? Will that be enough time for you to \\\\nconsider this?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So----\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. You have not seen the questions, but----\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes, I have not seen the questions, but \\\\nI commit we will respond and we will try to do it as best we \\\\ncan as quickly as we can.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. And we will follow up, and once you have \\\\nhad a chance to look at them, I have got a copy of it here \\\\ntoday. We would love a sense for just when you will have time \\\\nto get to them.\\\\n    We are going to drive this this Congress, and you know, \\\\ntime is running out. We want to get this going.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Having sat where you sit today, I know \\\\nhow important it is to get the answers.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Some more context on that, if you will \\\\ncommit to working with us to make these quality measures \\\\noutcome oriented and transparent, would you be willing to, you \\\\nknow, without seeing the exact questions, making this outcome \\\\noriented and transparent we think is a significant bipartisan \\\\nwin here so that they are indicative of the quality of care \\\\npatients actually receive and that patients are not in some \\\\ncases forced to shop around for their health care in the dark?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, looking forward to working \\\\nwith you and reading this letter.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. Thank you.\\\\n    Finally, the last piece here on the budget, your budget \\\\nclaims to extend Medicare solvency by 25 years. I looked at \\\\nthis. My team looked at this, and your plan, the way we view it \\\\ndoes this primarily by funneling existing general tax revenues \\\\nto the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.\\\\n    The trust fund, general, it is just funneling them over \\\\ninto the trust fund to extend that solvency.\\\\n    According to CBO data, if Medicare is allowed to run its \\\\ncourse and we merely finance it by borrowing against our \\\\nchildren&#x27;s future, Medicare will add over $17 trillion to the \\\\nnational debt over the next 25 years just in additional \\\\ninterest payments.\\\\n    When you and the President formulated your budget, did you \\\\nconsider the cost, the specific cost, of additional interest \\\\npayments caused by borrowing?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. And, Congressman, again, I do not \\\\nunderstand that math because the President&#x27;s budget, as opposed \\\\nto what you have described, the President&#x27;s budget actually \\\\nreduces deficits. It not only extends the life of Medicare and \\\\nstrengthens it, but it reduces deficits moving forward into the \\\\nfuture.\\\\n    It makes some painful decisions that some folks may not \\\\nlike, but it does protect Medicare, those benefits, and it does \\\\ncontinue to make it available not just for today&#x27;s seniors but \\\\nthe next generation.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. We had an opportunity to dig into this \\\\nin the Budgetary Committee, and there is argument over whether \\\\nthat truly does reduce deficits here.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I would love to go through those \\\\nnumbers.\\\\n    Mr. MOORE of Utah. You are taking from one pot and just \\\\npushing it into the other. We are not truly going after the \\\\nsolvency here.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Again, I disagree with that, and I am \\\\nmore than willing to sit down and go number to number, mano to \\\\nmano on that one because the President made a commitment. It is \\\\nreal.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We will gladly sit down and go mano to \\\\nmano at any time on this, on these details.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Mrs. Steel from California is recognized.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Thank you, Chairman Smith.\\\\n    And thank you, Secretary Becerra, your coming out and you \\\\nknow how many hours you have been here for testifying. So I \\\\nreally appreciate that.\\\\n    You know, I am concerned about Center for Medicare and \\\\nMedicaid Services&#x27; oversight of new Hospices and home health \\\\nagencies. This is particularly an issue in California, which \\\\ninstituted a moratorium on State licensures January 1st, 2022.\\\\n    Despite this moratorium, Hospices in California that \\\\npreviously received State licenses are still being certified by \\\\nMedicare. In fact, 443 California-based Hospices received \\\\nMedicare certification in 2022. Three hundred seventy-five out \\\\nof 443 were issued in L.A. County only.\\\\n    Considering the moratorium in California and the State \\\\nAuditor&#x27;s Report highlighting these bad actors, why is Medicare \\\\nstill certifying Hospices that are likely engaged in fraud?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, that is a great question. I \\\\nam not totally abreast of what the State of California, my \\\\nState, is doing, but as you will recognize, the laws that guide \\\\nus on Medicare and Hospice care are different from what guides \\\\nthe State of California.\\\\n    What the State can do is not necessarily what we can do and \\\\nvice versa. If someone applies to provide Hospice care, we have \\\\nto make sure that what they are doing is fulfilling the \\\\ncriteria that by Federal law they must achieve. If they do, we \\\\ndo not have the luxury of saying, ``No, we will not because \\\\nyour State is saying you may not be a good actor.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    We have to base it on the information they provide to us, \\\\nand if they meet the criteria to qualify for funding under \\\\nMedicare.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. So who does the audit?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Who does what audit?\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. These Hospice cares, especially caretakers.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. If you are talking about the work that \\\\nthe State has done to suspend further licensing, then it is the \\\\nState who would do some of those audits.\\\\n    If you are talking about the Medicare Program, that is a \\\\nFederal program. The State does not operate Medicare.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. So Medicare certifications they were just still \\\\ngiving out to these fraud cases.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Medicare would not give out a \\\\ncertificate for operation of a Hospice Care Program if it was \\\\ndoing it fraudulently. Those programs would have to be able to \\\\nshow that they meet the criteria.\\\\n    If they subsequently commit fraud----\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. So who finds out that they are fraudulent, such \\\\nis the case or not? Who find out? Because it is the Medicare \\\\ncertificate that we are talking about here.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. That is where you rely on the surveyors, \\\\nthe investigators who periodically go in to see how those \\\\nprograms are operating.\\\\n    The State might have some folks who are doing it. When I \\\\nwas Attorney General of California, we had the authority to go \\\\nin and look at all of these different facilities for how they \\\\nwere caring for folks. That is why we expanded the program that \\\\nactually looks into nursing homes.\\\\n    That is different from what the Federal Government does.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. So you know what? Let me just change the issue. \\\\nI am going to go a little more deeply, and I am going to work \\\\nwith you about this.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Of course.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. Fraudulent certificates.\\\\n    But lastly, constituents of mine from Fullerton and \\\\nPlacentia rallied on Capitol Hill about CMS decisions to deny \\\\nsenior access to vital Alzheimer&#x27;s treatments.\\\\n    What do you expect me to tell my constituents about not \\\\nhaving access to care? Because USC, Stanford, UCLA, UC-Irvine, \\\\nUC-Berkeley, UC-San Diego, these are just really good \\\\nuniversities. They all say it is a breakthrough medication.\\\\n    So why not?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, I would tell you to tell \\\\nthem that you will advocate as hard as you can to make sure \\\\nthat where possible, we will make access to those medicines and \\\\nservice that help them with their particular condition or \\\\ndisease.\\\\n    And if they probe even further, you might want to make sure \\\\nyou can tell them the distinction, the difference between the \\\\nwork that the FDA does to make a drug available and the work \\\\nthat CMS does within the Medicare system to make those drugs \\\\navailable for reimbursement within the Medicare Program.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. So how are we going to do that though because \\\\nthey are not reimbursing it? They have been denying those \\\\ncoverages.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. That is what I am saying. People have to \\\\nunderstand how CMS and Medicare operate so they can understand \\\\nthe decisions, the determinations that are made by CMS.\\\\n    CMS did provide some coverage for some of those Alzheimer&#x27;s \\\\ndrugs, but under limited conditions.\\\\n    Mrs. STEEL. You know what? My time is up. I am going to do \\\\nit in writing and I will ask all of these questions. Actually I \\\\nhave more than ten questions here that I want to ask you, but I \\\\njust do not have time.\\\\n    So I yield back.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Thank you, Representative.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The Representative from Virginia, Mr. \\\\nBeyer.\\\\n    Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, thank you to you and Ranking \\\\nMember Neal for having this hearing.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Ways and Means. It is great \\\\nto have you back.\\\\n    I want to praise the work that you have done and CDC and \\\\nSAMHSA on suicide prevention. There is always a lot more work \\\\nto be done, but I am really proud of this Administration&#x27;s \\\\nbudget, your intent to take suicide seriously.\\\\n    The $80 million directed just for the Suicide Prevention \\\\nProgram for CDC for fiscal year 2024 is just wonderful.\\\\n    You know one of the biggest pieces has been the transition \\\\nto the lifeline, to the 988 number, and you mentioned it in \\\\nyour opening statement.\\\\n    Thanks, by the way, to Mr. Moulton, a Democrat, and Mr. \\\\nStewart, a Republican, and their leadership on this issue.\\\\n    And we successfully secured funding to help that transition \\\\nlast year, but it only went into effect in July. There was a \\\\nhuge surge in August in that number, and right now I think \\\\nSAMHSA expects calls to double in this next year as word is \\\\ngetting out about the 988.\\\\n    And one of the pieces of this conversation is trying to get \\\\nan awareness of the campaign going for the new number and for \\\\nsuicide resources broadly because how we treat it today is much \\\\ndifferent than when we were kids.\\\\n    And this, by the way, was something that Governor Gianforte \\\\nand Mr. Kinzinger have both partnered with me on, and I was \\\\nencouraged to see this year&#x27;s President&#x27;s budget called for an \\\\nawareness campaign similar to the bill we had last year, the \\\\nCampaign to Prevent Suicide Act.\\\\n    Can you just speak to us as the leading health care \\\\nofficial in this country about why this is so important?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, I do not know if there is \\\\nanyone in America who has not lost a loved one at some point \\\\nbecause of suicide or drug overdose, and it is amazing to see \\\\nthe age of some of the people who are calling in to 988, \\\\nchildren, pre-teens.\\\\n    You hear the stories from parents about how they are not \\\\nsure what to do, that their kids are suffering. You hear the \\\\nstories directly from the children. America is hurting.\\\\n    COVID did not create it. It just really exposed some of \\\\nwhat is going on, and the President is very committed to 988 \\\\nbecause it is a way to say to people who are hurting we are \\\\nhere, we are listening, and we are here to catch you.\\\\n    And thank God working with all the States we were able to \\\\nstand up a program that actually works, and now the President \\\\nwants to continue to double down, do even more, and I hope you \\\\nwill help us with that because we want to do six million \\\\nadditional contacts.\\\\n    Mr. BEYER. Great. Thank you.\\\\n    One more question. I am intensely interested in looking at \\\\nhow we can decrease costs within the health care system, and \\\\nAHRQ, a foundational agency that helps tackle much of this \\\\nwork, and I have been particularly interested in the role of \\\\nall payer claims databases.\\\\n    You know, State after State have picked this up, and it is \\\\nwonderful how all of the data is pulled together State by \\\\nState, but what we really need is a Federal all payer claims \\\\ndatabase to bring this all together.\\\\n    And I know your budget looks at supporting this work within \\\\nAHRQ. Can you speak to what you might see as the benefits of an \\\\nall-payer claims database on a national level?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Well, we will get to see what every \\\\ncountry is doing better, and we will get to pass along the best \\\\npractices to every part of the country because by collecting \\\\ndata and having it from all parts of the country, we can let \\\\nfolks see what is working and what is not.\\\\n    But if you are never seeing the data, you will never know \\\\nthe success stories or the failures and will continue to make \\\\nthe same mistakes.\\\\n    And so we are hoping that we can do a far better job of \\\\ncollecting that data nationally because there is so much data \\\\nout there now. It is just that we do not have in some cases the \\\\nauthority or in some cases the capacity to collect it, but, \\\\nboy, if we were able to collect it, Congressman, the stories we \\\\ncould tell and the improvements we could make in the health \\\\ncare system.\\\\n    Mr. BEYER. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, very much.\\\\n    And I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you.\\\\n    Mrs. Fischbach from Minnesota is recognized.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the \\\\nopportunity.\\\\n    You know, I am going to just power through these because I \\\\nhave got a few questions.\\\\n    Secretary, throughout my district and across the Nation \\\\nnursing homes are already struggling to maintain current \\\\nstaffing levels and have an even more difficult time finding \\\\nnew staff members to fill vacancies.\\\\n    And I know there was some discussion about nursing homes, \\\\nbut President Biden&#x27;s additional staff ratios requirements on \\\\ntop of the ongoing workforce shortages would greatly reduce the \\\\nnumber of patients served in facilities.\\\\n    Secretary, do you agree that long-term care facilities are \\\\nfacing labor shortages?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, without a doubt the whole \\\\nhealth care system is facing shortages.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. And I agree with that, Mr. Secretary.\\\\n    Could the President&#x27;s new staffing ratios force nursing \\\\nhomes to reduce the number of patients they can serve or, \\\\nworse, even close their doors entirely?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Ah, here is where we probably diverge \\\\nbecause I would say the most important thing about any nursing \\\\nhome facility is that they offer quality care, and if you \\\\ncannot offer quality care, maybe you should not have your doors \\\\nopen.\\\\n    And that is why we want to make sure that if you are open, \\\\nfirst and foremost, you care about the people that you are \\\\nserving, which means you have to have the level of services \\\\nrequired for the people that are needed.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Well, Mr. Secretary, are staffing ratios \\\\nthe only measurement of care?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Oh, no, no, no.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Quality care?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. No. There are many measures.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Okay.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. But staffing levels make a difference.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. But potentially you could close nursing \\\\nhomes, I think, is what you said.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. By themselves, they should not be the \\\\nreason you close. If you have the correct number of staff----\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Well, if they cannot get enough, Mr. \\\\nSecretary, if they cannot get enough nurses or nursing staff--\\\\n--\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. What if they do not provide enough \\\\nnurses? Is that good?\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. That is not the issue here because it is \\\\nratios and you are going to increase those and make it already \\\\nmore difficult. It is difficult to get nurses, and I think you \\\\nagreed with that.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Obtaining nurses, and they will tell you \\\\nthey cannot have them doing everything for everyone. You need \\\\nto have enough nurses in a facility. You are right.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Nurse and CNAs and LPNs, nursing staff.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. And you know, Mr. Secretary, I do not know \\\\nwho you are talking to, but I do think maybe you should talk to \\\\nsome of the rural folks that are struggling to keep nursing \\\\nhomes open under the already tight ratios and provide people \\\\ncare close to their families and close to their homes.\\\\n    But I have got to move on.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I just want to assure you we have been \\\\ntalking to folks in rural America about this.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Reclaiming my time, Secretary, the Hyde \\\\nAmendment protects taxpayers by prohibiting taxpayer funding of \\\\nabortion, and as you well know, this language, this vital \\\\nlanguage, has been included in appropriations bills every time \\\\nsince 1977, with strong bipartisan support.\\\\n    Does the President&#x27;s budget request include the Hyde \\\\nAmendment language?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. The President&#x27;s budget does everything \\\\npossible to make sure that women are entitled or afforded----\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. I am asking you a direct question, Mr. \\\\nSecretary. I think it is a yes or no.\\\\n    Does the President&#x27;s budget request include the Hyde \\\\nAmendment?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. The Hyde Amendment is something that \\\\nCongress has added, and it is up to Congress to determine \\\\nwhether it will add the Hyde Amendment.\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Well, does the President want the Hyde \\\\nAmendment included in that budget request?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. The President&#x27;s budget does everything \\\\npossible to protect the reproductive health care rights of \\\\nall----\\\\n    Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Secretary, with all due respect, I am \\\\ngoing to take that as a no.\\\\n    And the Dornan Amendment, I am assuming that is also a no, \\\\nthat that is not included in the language in the legislation \\\\neither.\\\\n    And I do not know. I should at some point find out for \\\\nsure. I know we have been looking for language on the budget, \\\\nif we have gotten that, but I am going to assume that neither \\\\nof those are included because you did not answer with a yes or \\\\nno.\\\\n    But this is something since 1977 that has been included \\\\nwith bipartisan support, and it really does leave Americans \\\\nvulnerable to being forced to pay for elective abortions, even \\\\nthough the majority of Americans are opposed to tax dollars \\\\ngoing towards abortion funding.\\\\n    But I understand that under this budget the Democrats would \\\\nrather appease their extremist base that want Federal funding \\\\nfor abortion on demand, and I just say it will be very, very \\\\nsad that the left is forcing this onto Americans.\\\\n    With that I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. EVANS. Mr. Secretary, it is a pleasure to have you come \\\\nback before this committee. I have enjoyed listening to you.\\\\n    This year, no one on Medicaid will pay more than $35 a \\\\nmonth for insulin. The question I would ask you, Mr. Secretary, \\\\ncan you please explain and discuss how the change helps \\\\nconstituents in Philadelphia and across the country?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, the benefits are immediate. \\\\nI cannot tell you how many folks have come up to me and said, \\\\n``I cannot believe it. In December, I was paying&#x27;&#x27;--I think \\\\nthis one woman was paying $117 for her insulin for a month, and \\\\nshe said, ``I got charged $35 in January. I went back to the \\\\nprovider and said I think you underbilled me, and they said, \\\\nno, that is the new price.&#x27;&#x27; She was ecstatic.\\\\n    And that is something that is being repeated over and over \\\\nbecause the savings are not just real, but they are current, \\\\nand I will tell you that in your State of Pennsylvania, the \\\\nsavings on average this year for Americans who are on Medicare \\\\nand need insulin will be somewhere around close to $550. That \\\\nis $550 in their pocket that they would have had to otherwise \\\\nspend to buy their insulin.\\\\n    That is the average. That means some people are saving a \\\\nlittle less, but it means there are a whole bunch of folks who \\\\nare saving a lot more.\\\\n    Mr. EVANS. I want to thank you.\\\\n    I yield back. I thank you very much.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentlemen from Iowa, Mr. Feenstra, is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Thank you, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member \\\\nNeal.\\\\n    And thank you, Secretary Becerra, for being in front of us \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    I have just got a quick question. Do you support a single \\\\npayer system?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, I have worked for many, \\\\nmany years to make universal health care available to all \\\\nAmericans, and now as the Secretary I put into place the \\\\nPresident&#x27;s proposals which include lowering cost----\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. So you are simply saying you are not going to \\\\nanswer the question and you are going to dodge the question.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I have always been for universal health \\\\ncare, to make sure everybody----\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Well, here is why I asked that. I listen to \\\\nall of my colleagues, and the responses I have got it seems \\\\nlike we are going down that path very quickly.\\\\n    When you start capping obviously pharmaceuticals, that \\\\ncrushes the research and development. When you do not update, \\\\nyou know, your reimbursements, that obviously dramatically \\\\nhurts rural hospitals, rural clinics, doctors, and so forth.\\\\n    And then the elimination of 2,200 codes is an actual \\\\ncrusher. So my question to you is this. If you dramatically \\\\nincrease taxes on a business, do you think that business will \\\\npass those increased costs onto the consumer?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. You are asking me a question which is \\\\nspeculation.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. All right. You are not going to answer that.\\\\n    Let me say this. Cutting payment to health plans in the \\\\nend, it will be the patient that bears the cost. We have seen \\\\nthis time and time again. It happens.\\\\n    And a recent analysis suggests that this will be about $540 \\\\nper month per member per year. So the Biden Administration \\\\nhighlights its desire to lower cost on health coverage and \\\\nprovide better benefit. Yet the 30 million seniors and people \\\\nwith disabilities who choose to enroll in Medicare Advantage, \\\\nwhich is close to 50 percent of them, will see either the \\\\nbenefits reduced or the costs go up.\\\\n    So how is the Administration and yourself, how do you \\\\nexplain that to the customers?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Because, Congressman, there is nothing \\\\nin our proposals that would cut Medicare benefits. I defy you \\\\nto find me something in our proposal.\\\\n    That is what the commercials say that are paid for by the--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Okay. So this is you singularly saying this, \\\\nbut do you want to know something? A hundred and fifty groups \\\\nthat represent patient, providers, and plans--I yield back--150 \\\\ngroups representing patients, providers, and plans are saying \\\\nthat this will happen, and including the American Medical \\\\nAssociation.\\\\n    So who is right, yourself or 150 other groups that are \\\\nsaying that this is what is going to happen?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Take a look at the proposal. It makes--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. Your proposal is arbitrary, and if I had to \\\\nguess, if I look at the real nuts and bolts of it, it is wrong.\\\\n    Now we are arguing.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. We are not arguing, Congressman. It is \\\\njust a fact. We are not getting paid money to do those \\\\ncommercials. They----\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. I have not just fallen off a turnip truck. I \\\\nhave my Ph.D. in health care administration. I see what is \\\\ngoing on here. All right? I see what is going on.\\\\n    And if we were here next year at this time when all the \\\\nMed. Advantage plans go up or their benefits are lost, I would \\\\nlove to hear what you have to say.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman----\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. And I yield back.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. They cannot cut those benefits.\\\\n    Mr. FEENSTRA. I yield back.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. That is the deception that is going on. \\\\nThey cannot cut Medicare benefits. They can tell people that, \\\\nbut they cannot cut those benefits.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Schneider, \\\\nis recognized.\\\\n    Mr. SCHNEIDER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    It is always good to see you and thank you for making the \\\\ntime to be here, and your patience.\\\\n    You know, it is critically important that we continue to \\\\nmake the progress we have made on expanding affordable access \\\\nto health care. As you talked to, it has been a lifetime \\\\ndevotion for you, and I appreciate your work and will continue \\\\nto do so.\\\\n    I take great pride in the fact that in the decade since ACA \\\\nbecame law, the number of Americans without health insurance \\\\nhas dropped by almost half. Preexisting conditions are no \\\\nlonger a barrier to getting health insurance. Kids are able to \\\\nstay on their parents&#x27; program until age 26, and lifetime caps \\\\nare history, and those are just a few of the highlights of ACA.\\\\n    I want to focus on telemedicine. According to the CDC, just \\\\nin 2021, more than one-third of Americans made use of \\\\ntelemedicine in the previous year. Prior to the pandemic, I do \\\\nnot want to speak for everyone, but I would suggest that this \\\\npanel ran the spectrum from curious to skeptical on telehealth.\\\\n    Post-pandemic, I can promise you that this is a roomful of \\\\nevangelists singing the benefits of telehealth.\\\\n    Telemedicine has improved access for virtually every \\\\nAmerican, including those who live far from medical facilities, \\\\nthose who do not have ready access to transportation, folks in \\\\nneed of mental health who cannot find a provider with an open \\\\nappointment near them, or maybe they are just too shy to go in \\\\npublic because of the perceived stigma.\\\\n    So with the emergency coming to an end in May and the \\\\npandemic winding down, we have to consider how we are going to \\\\ntake the lessons learned from telehealth and make sure that \\\\nthey stay strong.\\\\n    I will soon introduce my bill, the Primary and Virtual Care \\\\nAffordability Act. This bill would extend the temporary \\\\nprovision that allowed HSA eligible, high deductible plans to \\\\nwaive the deductible for telehealth services.\\\\n    I am also joining with my colleague, Mrs. Steel, as co-lead \\\\non her bill, Telehealth Expansion Act, that is being introduced \\\\ntoday, may have already been introduced, to make telehealth \\\\nflexibility permanent.\\\\n    My question for you in the last minute is can you speak to \\\\nthe Administration&#x27;s other actions to expand telehealth \\\\nservices, and how do we build on this progress to make sure \\\\ntelehealth is something that is part of our future?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I will mention one thing that actually \\\\nis not within HHS&#x27; jurisdiction which is crucial if you are \\\\ngoing to get your bill passed and deployed, and that is that \\\\nbroadband has to be made accessible to all communities because \\\\nyou can do telehealth if you have got good broadband, but if \\\\nyou do not have good broadband, you cannot do the connection.\\\\n    And so we want to make sure all communities have decent \\\\nbroadband so they can take full advantage of telehealth.\\\\n    The other thing we want to make sure we do is get people \\\\ntrained up. So especially places like rural America, we get \\\\nproviders, physicians who are ready to use telehealth because \\\\nin some of those communities, that is where it is going to have \\\\nthe greatest advantage. And so we want to make sure folks are \\\\nready for this time.\\\\n    And then finally, we are going to need to work with you \\\\nbecause the end of 2024 will come soon. Those extensions for \\\\ntelehealth will be upon us before you know it, and what we do \\\\nnot want is for a whole bunch of providers to be wondering can \\\\nwe or can we not continue to do this. The clock is ticking.\\\\n    Better we take care of it early to give predictability to \\\\nthose providers of how we will do telehealth.\\\\n    Mr. SCHNEIDER. My hope is we can extend telehealth long \\\\nbefore we get to the deadline in 2024.\\\\n    Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentlelady from New York, Ms. \\\\nMalliotakis.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you, Secretary, for being here today.\\\\n    You know, this Administration talks a lot about setting \\\\nwhat I would call innovation killing price controls, but one of \\\\nthe things that I do want to talk to you about where I think we \\\\ncould really work together on access and affordability of \\\\nprescription drugs would be PBMs. Okay?\\\\n    Obviously, our pharmacy benefit managers, which it is \\\\ntroubling to me that the three largest PBMs actually control 80 \\\\npercent of the market. There is no transparency. They are \\\\nmaking a lot of money by keeping rebates instead of passing \\\\nthem on to consumers.\\\\n    They exclude drugs from their formulary, and they are \\\\ndictating what their competitors are making, right? And they \\\\nare crushing my small Mom and Pop pharmacies.\\\\n    Here you have PBMs that are also the insurer and then they \\\\nare the pharmacy, and they are controlling everything in terms \\\\nof pricing. Okay?\\\\n    For example, CVS Caremark, they also own the insurance \\\\ncompany Aetna, and then they own the pharmacy, CVSes all over \\\\nthe country.\\\\n    Now, do you think that is a problem?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congresswoman, PBMs, you know, no one \\\\nknows everything they do. We are surprised sometimes when we \\\\nsee what comes out, and there absolutely has to be more \\\\ntransparency in the way they do business.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Well, the FTC recently announced their \\\\nplans to probe the largest six PBMs in the U.S., and with the \\\\nrole that PBMs play in Medicare drug pricing, can you explain \\\\nwhy HHS has not launched its own investigations, is not pushing \\\\nfor more transparency in order to shed some light into this \\\\nvery opaque process?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Well, Congresswoman, let me assure you \\\\nwe are working in this space. You may not have seen a \\\\nparticular rule come forward, but we are absolutely working in \\\\nthis space.\\\\n    And if you are interested, we would love to work with you \\\\nbecause this is an area where reform is needed.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Well, you say you are working in the \\\\nspace. How so?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Some of the work that we are doing is in \\\\nthe process of we are trying to get some rules ready that would \\\\ndeal with some of this. At the same time we are trying to avoid \\\\nsome of the lawsuits that are being filed.\\\\n    And what we are trying to do is continuing to give \\\\nconsumers access to some of these prescription drugs at the \\\\nbest cost we can get for them.\\\\n    It is difficult, but we are trying to do what we can \\\\nworking within the constraints we have within the laws because \\\\nwe can only go as far as the authorities have given us.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Well, I think actually the Administration \\\\nis, I think, in a unique position to be going after the PBMs \\\\nactually.\\\\n    And you mentioned rules. You said that, ``I see a rule,&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nand then you said, ``Well, we have some rules coming out.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    You know, I think that needs to be clarified there that \\\\nmaybe you have not done anything just yet, but I am just trying \\\\nto understand why HHS seems to be sitting on the sidelines and \\\\ngiving PBMs, you know, free rein considering the role that they \\\\nare playing, particularly in Medicare prices, but also just \\\\npharmaceutical drugs for all our constituents who are paying \\\\njust way too much right now, and it is because of the games \\\\nthat they are playing and the lack of transparency.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Yes. I can guarantee you we are not \\\\nsitting on the sidelines. As we have talked about insulin, it \\\\nis $35 a month.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Well, once again, that is a price control. \\\\nThat is not going after the PBMs.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. But we are affecting the price of drugs. \\\\nWe are making them more affordable and that is what counts. And \\\\nultimately the work whether PBMs or making sure we negotiate \\\\nprices for drugs, it is to make sure consumers, Americans, get \\\\nbetter prices for their medication.\\\\n    Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. I have run out of time.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Mr. Secretary, good to see you again.\\\\n    In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\\\nreported that Ohio had the fifth largest overdose death rate in \\\\nthe country. In the same year, Ohio, fentanyl was involved in \\\\n81 percent of all of the overdose deaths, often with a \\\\ncombination of drugs.\\\\n    Last year Drug Enforcement Agency seized enough fentanyl to \\\\nkill every American, capturing more than 50 million fentanyl-\\\\nlaced pills and over 10,000 pounds of fentanyl powder.\\\\n    I have been to the border. I have seen how the cartels are \\\\nable to smuggle drugs into the communities, and we need HHS to \\\\nprotect Americans from fentanyl flooding our border.\\\\n    We need to hold Mexico accountable and continue to warn \\\\nAmericans about the potential for fentanyl-laced drugs.\\\\n    In the President&#x27;s budget, there is roughly $40 million to \\\\ncombat fentanyl trafficking and disrupt international criminal \\\\norganizations.\\\\n    What steps, Mr. Secretary, is your agency taking to prevent \\\\nfentanyl from entering the United States and killing more \\\\nAmericans, including constituents of mine back in Ohio?\\\\n    Your answer, sir?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, and I want to be respectful \\\\nhere in the answer because you are asking me what I at HHS can \\\\ndo, and much of what you are asking is about the border, and \\\\nthat is not within the purview of Department of Health and \\\\nHuman Services.\\\\n    I can tell you if you wish--I know you have limited time--\\\\nwhat we are doing with regard to fentanyl, but it will not be \\\\nso much at the border. That is really the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security and other agencies.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. So is HHS working to combat the large amounts of \\\\nfentanyl-laced drugs currently circulating in the U.S.?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Absolutely. We are dedicating some $11 \\\\nbillion in our budget for drug overdose prevention and to try \\\\nto address it as best we can working with the States.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Just one thing I found that was interesting in \\\\nthe President&#x27;s budget. Climate is mentioned 74 times more than \\\\nthe word ``fentanyl.&#x27;&#x27; So just an interesting point.\\\\n    Real quick, I do want to just touch upon something that we \\\\nhave seen particularly during the COVID time with our EMS \\\\npersonnel and with the treatment in place that we have actually \\\\nseen, and it has been really saving people a lot of money \\\\nbecause, as you are well aware, EMS personnel in the past, and \\\\ncurrently most of our EMS personnel, are actually only paid if \\\\nthey take somebody to a hospital.\\\\n    But under this waiver program with this treatment in place, \\\\nwe are finding that these folks are able to actually save money \\\\nby being able to diagnose it on site.\\\\n    So it is a good program. It is something that I know works \\\\nwith your agency. I just wondered if you had any thoughts on \\\\nthat.\\\\n    You know, I have 45 seconds.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. And I will be brief. It moves us more \\\\ntoward prevention and rather than waiting till you send someone \\\\nto the ER room and see if you can catch them before they die. \\\\nIt is trying to make use of the evidence that shows that \\\\ncertain preventive approaches can actually save lives early.\\\\n    And so we want to move in that direction where we can.\\\\n    Mr. CAREY. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\\\n    Mr. Chair, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. The gentleman from California is \\\\nrecognized.\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking \\\\nMember Neal.\\\\n    Mr. Secretary, it is good to see you again. Thank you for \\\\ncoming back and being here and being willing to answer these \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    In recent months, more so kind of in recent weeks, we have \\\\nheard a lot of reports about the spread of illicit xylazine \\\\nbeing cut with fentanyl. Fentanyl has been using xylazine to be \\\\ncut and creating this drug that we are hearing that is called \\\\n``Tranq&#x27;&#x27; or ``Zombie drug&#x27;&#x27; that does some miserable things to \\\\nthe human body, including eating flesh and potentially leading \\\\nto amputation and making the use of fentanyl cheaper, more \\\\naddictive, and even deadlier.\\\\n    Xylazine itself is used by people for sedatives in animals. \\\\nSo those are illicit uses. However, there is no licit purpose \\\\nfor it to be used in humans.\\\\n    That is why I have introduced my bipartisan, bicameral bill \\\\ntoday called Combatting Illicit Xylazine Act, which will help \\\\nbasically allow enforcement of the illicit use of Xylazine \\\\nunder Section 21 USC, as well as using the CSA under Schedule 3 \\\\nof the CSA, of the scheduled drugs.\\\\n    I just wanted to make you aware of that, but also wanted to \\\\nsee if your department is responding to the Xylazine threat in \\\\nany way.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. I can get back to you because I cannot \\\\ntell you specifically what we might be doing, but we are \\\\ngenerally speaking, whether it is opioids, whether it is \\\\nfentanyl, we have a drug prevention strategy that tries to help \\\\nlocalities address the scourge of drugs.\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. Great. Thank you.\\\\n    Moving on to Medicare economic index, MEI, according to \\\\ndata from the Medicare Trustees, Medicare physician pay \\\\nnationwide has increased just ten percent over the last two \\\\ndecades, as you know--well.\\\\n    Meanwhile the cost of care increased 42 percent from 2001 \\\\nto 2022. This type of inflation measured by the Medicare \\\\neconomic index is even worse in our home State of California.\\\\n    This month MedPAC recommended that Congress increase \\\\nphysician fee rates above the current law and make an \\\\ninflation-based payment tied to the MEI.\\\\n    A couple of questions here for you. Can you talk more about \\\\nwhy the physician fee schedule has failed to keep up with the \\\\ncost of care?\\\\n    Do you agree that indexing these fees for inflation is the \\\\nright solution?\\\\n    Is there anything that we can do legislatively to correct \\\\nthis?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Actually, your last statement is the \\\\nmost operative, Congressman, because having been where you are \\\\nfor 24 years, I remember going through this all the time.\\\\n    By law we have to make sure we level set when it comes to \\\\nthe payments that we make to physicians. It has to be neutral. \\\\nSo if you raise it here, you have got to lower it here. You \\\\nhave to be budget neutral.\\\\n    And so that is one of the issues that is at hand here. We \\\\ncannot change that. You have to change that.\\\\n    And so when you ask is there something that we, meaning \\\\nCongress, can do, you have to take a look at how you want to do \\\\nthe reimbursement for physicians. If you are going to leave it \\\\nto us and if we have to be budget neutral, we are always going \\\\nto be making adjustments that hurt some and help others.\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. In the same note, obviously Medicare \\\\ngeographic adjustments, they really have not kept up with the \\\\ncost of care and created access challenges for many \\\\nconstituents of mine receiving traditional Medicare.\\\\n    Is the HHS doing anything about the geographic adjustments \\\\nhaving not kept up with the cost of care?\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, you are talking to a \\\\nCalifornian.\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. Yes.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. So fully aware. Again, where we can do, \\\\nhow we can do it, to some degree we are constrained by \\\\nstatutory prescriptions.\\\\n    What we try to do is make sure we make the adjustments \\\\nbased on the best evidence we have in front of us.\\\\n    Mr. PANETTA. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Thank you.\\\\n    I want to thank you, Mr. Secretary, for staying throughout.\\\\n    Oh, well, you are not done yet. We do have one more member.\\\\n    Before we proceed there, I would like to just say how it is \\\\ngreat to see so many of the Alzheimer&#x27;s advocates in the \\\\naudience today. You can see the passion that several of our \\\\nmembers on both sides have in regard to making sure that you \\\\nhave the right medicines and the cures. But it is good to see \\\\nyou throughout the entire hearing.\\\\n    Mr. Arrington from Texas.\\\\n    Mr. ARRINGTON. Thank you, Chairman. My apologies for coming \\\\nin late. I was balancing the budget. So I was delayed.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, you can go back to \\\\nbalancing the budget. That is okay with me.\\\\n    Mr. ARRINGTON. I know. Well, listen. My constituents would \\\\nsay the same thing. Quit talking. Go save this country from a \\\\ndebt crisis.\\\\n    In all seriousness, both parties have made their \\\\ncontributions to this runaway deficit and unsustainable debt \\\\ntrajectory, and I say that, Mr. Secretary, because I am not \\\\ngiving any party a pass on it.\\\\n    But before we put out our budget and our long-term vision \\\\nand the values reflected in that budget framework, we are \\\\nunpacking President Biden&#x27;s budget, and there is a lot to \\\\nunpack because it is the highest levels of sustained spending, \\\\ntaxes, and deficits in the history of the United States.\\\\n    And this after a lot of spending, a lot of inflation, \\\\nsoaring interest rates, and an economy that is spiraling \\\\ndownward.\\\\n    So I am looking for a change in direction. I am looking for \\\\na course correction, and I see nothing but doubling down on the \\\\npolicies that are driving the deficit spending and the debt and \\\\nvery little consideration, in my opinion, for our children and \\\\ngrandchildren because we are really borrowing on their backs \\\\nand their future to pay for this stuff.\\\\n    When it comes to health care, which is a big driver and one \\\\nthat we all have to roll up our sleeves and figure out how do \\\\nwe lower cost of health care across the board, I was very \\\\nconcerned about the expansion of Obamacare subsidies in the \\\\nIRA, about $65 billion worth, and now in the President&#x27;s budget \\\\nproposal, I am sure you are aware, $185 billion in more \\\\nexpansion.\\\\n    Here is the first rub for me. We are expanding to people \\\\nwho already have insurance, as I know you are aware. In the \\\\nIRA, we only covered 1.7 million people who were uninsured. The \\\\nrest of the folks that were covered who were making, by the \\\\nway, upwards of 200, $300,000 already had employer-based \\\\ninsurance.\\\\n    So we are spending taxpayer monies to subsidize people that \\\\nare making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\\\\n    In the second round I have read--I have not confirmed \\\\nthis--that people making upwards of $600,000 are getting ACA \\\\nsubsidies. Now, that does not make sense in any world to me \\\\nunless the intention is to move our country to a universal care \\\\nsystem, to a single payer system.\\\\n    Is that the real--it is okay. It is a position. It is a \\\\nview of the world and government&#x27;s role. It is not my view, but \\\\nis that--and I am not being cute about it. Is that the \\\\nintention of these expansions of Obamacare to people making \\\\nhundreds of thousands of dollars who already have insurance?\\\\n    Are you trying to move the country to a single payer \\\\nsystem?\\\\n    And I yield for the answer, and I appreciate your time.\\\\n    Secretary BECERRA. Congressman, thank you for the question.\\\\n    I have to start by saying that your depiction of the \\\\nPresident&#x27;s budget I cannot agree with. Your numbers that you \\\\nmentioned, I do not know where you got them. I know nowhere \\\\nwhere anyone has ever mentioned that someone making $600,000 \\\\nwould qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage with subsidies.\\\\n    But what I can tell you is this. The President in his two \\\\nyears in office has reduced the deficits each year. The \\\\nPresident&#x27;s budget proposal that he put forward to Congress \\\\nalso reduces the budget deficits moving forward over ten years.\\\\n    And so I am not sure where you are getting those numbers, \\\\nbut the President&#x27;s numbers are out there, whether it is Office \\\\nof Management and Budget in the Executive Branch or whether it \\\\nis the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, which does the scoring \\\\nfor Congress. I remember that from 24 years.\\\\n    Both have said that the President&#x27;s budget would reduce \\\\ndeficits.\\\\n    Mr. ARRINGTON. I know my time has expired. So I am not \\\\ngoing to abuse that.\\\\n    I am just going to say we have a wildly different opinion \\\\nabout it, but I respect your answer and I appreciate your time.\\\\n    So I yield back and thank you.\\\\n    Chairman SMITH. Mr. Secretary, in my opening statement I \\\\nhighlighted the point that you all had an interaction with, \\\\n$183 billion in increased funding for Obamacare subsidies, and \\\\nyou can make up to $600,000 a year under the President&#x27;s \\\\nbudget, and that was in my leading statement.\\\\n    I do want to thank you for being here. We appreciate the \\\\nopportunity that you can be before the Ways and Means members.\\\\n    Please be advised that members have two weeks to submit \\\\nwritten questions to be answered later in writing. Those \\\\nquestions and your answers will be made part of the formal \\\\nhearing record.\\\\n    With that, the committee stands adjourned.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 5:19 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n                    MEMBER QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73167/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"05/11/2023\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"AMERICAN CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS: PROTECTING POLITICAL SPEECH\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73167, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"House Administration\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                   AMERICAN CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS:\\\\n                      PROTECTING POLITICAL SPEECH\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n                                HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                           COMMITTEE ON HOUSE\\\\n                             ADMINISTRATION\\\\n\\\\n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             FIRST SESSION\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                              MAY 11, 2023\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                              PART 1 OF 2\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n      Printed for the use of the Committee on House Administration\\\\n      \\\\n                  [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]      \\\\n\\\\n                             www.govinfo.gov\\\\n                           www.cha.house.gov\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE\\\\n                    \\\\n56-213                    WASHINGTON : 2024                              \\\\n                           \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                   COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION\\\\n\\\\n                    BRYAN STEIL, Wisconsin, Chairman\\\\n\\\\nBARRY LOUDERMILK, Georgia            JOSEPH MORELLE, New York,\\\\nH.

Our Founding Fathers \\\\nenshrined the First Amendment in the Constitution.\\\\n    Unfortunately, in our highly politicized political culture \\\\nand climate, the First Amendment has been under attack through \\\\nthe use of misinformation czars and cancel culture.\\\\n    As a result, many Americans have grown concerned that their \\\\nvoices will be suppressed or that their beliefs will be \\\\nweaponized against them.\\\\n    That is exactly what we saw 10 years ago, nearly to the \\\\nday, with the now infamous scandal at the IRS involving then \\\\nActing Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner. On May 10, \\\\n2013, the IRS had to apologize to conservative organizations \\\\nfor inappropriately targeting their applications for tax-exempt \\\\nstatus. The Federal Government admitted to targeting a group of \\\\npeople because of their political beliefs. This is un-American \\\\nand anti-democratic.\\\\n    Over a decade later, we are still having conversations \\\\nabout the weaponization of the IRS and DHS, the need to protect \\\\ndonor privacy, and other free speech and freedom of association \\\\nissues.\\\\n    I am committed to upholding Americans&#x27; First Amendment \\\\nright to support candidates, causes, organizations of their \\\\nchoice without fear or retribution. That is why I am focused on \\\\nintroducing the American Confidence in Elections Act, or the \\\\nACE Act.\\\\n    The ACE Act is our Federalist approach to election \\\\nintegrity and voter confidence, which in turn boosts voter \\\\nparticipation.\\\\n    One thing we can do to build voter confidence is prevent \\\\nanother Lois Lerner scandal from occurring. The ACE Act will \\\\nfinally prohibit the IRS and any other Federal agencies from \\\\nasking for an organization&#x27;s donor lists, creating ad hoc \\\\nstandards, and applying them to ideologically opposed groups. \\\\nThis will help to protect individuals from retribution, \\\\nharassment, or intimidation based on their beliefs.\\\\n    In addition to protecting donor privacy, the ACE Act will \\\\nalso bring greater transparency and accountability into the \\\\nFederal campaign finance system. Last Congress every single \\\\nHouse Democrat voted to allow Federal funds to be used toward \\\\ntheir political campaigns. The ACE Act will specifically \\\\nprevent this from happening.\\\\n    It also encourages federalism by strengthening State \\\\npolitical parties. Instead of being centers for voter \\\\norganization and messaging, State parties are currently some of \\\\nthe most highly restricted organizations in our system.\\\\n    Voters already think our political parties can work \\\\ndirectly with their candidates with few restrictions, \\\\nRepublican Parties with Republican candidates, the Democratic \\\\nParty with Democratic candidates.\\\\n    In reality, the outdated campaign finance system means that \\\\nthere is all sorts of hoops to jump through for this simple \\\\npolitical process to work as expected. In many ways it does not \\\\nmake sense.\\\\n    Making the law work as voters expect will increase \\\\ntransparency in the campaign finance system, which will boost \\\\nvoters&#x27; confidence in our elections.\\\\n    As we begin today&#x27;s hearing, I look forward to discussing \\\\nsome of these provisions and identifying what additional \\\\ncampaign financial reforms and donor privacy protections are \\\\nnecessary in restoring voter confidence.\\\\n    I will also note that John Sarbanes will also be waived on \\\\nto this Committee in recognition of a request by the minority.\\\\n    I thank you for participating.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Chairman Steil follows:]\\\\n\\\\n   PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSE \\\\n                   ADMINISTRATION BRYAN STEIL\\\\n\\\\n    Political speech is protected speech.

Instead of being centers for voter \\\\norganization and messaging, State parties are currently some of \\\\nthe most highly restricted organizations in our system.\\\\n    Voters already think our political parties can work \\\\ndirectly with their candidates with few restrictions, \\\\nRepublican Parties with Republican candidates, the Democratic \\\\nParty with Democratic candidates.\\\\n    In reality, the outdated campaign finance system means that \\\\nthere is all sorts of hoops to jump through for this simple \\\\npolitical process to work as expected. In many ways it does not \\\\nmake sense.\\\\n    Making the law work as voters expect will increase \\\\ntransparency in the campaign finance system, which will boost \\\\nvoters&#x27; confidence in our elections.\\\\n    As we begin today&#x27;s hearing, I look forward to discussing \\\\nsome of these provisions and identifying what additional \\\\ncampaign financial reforms and donor privacy protections are \\\\nnecessary in restoring voter confidence.\\\\n\\\\n    I now recognize Ranking Member Morelle for 5 minutes for \\\\nthe purpose of making his opening statement.\\\\n\\\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON.

Good morning, Chairman Steil, \\\\nRanking Member Morelle, and Members of the Committee. I \\\\nappreciate your invitation to testify today on a topic that I \\\\nbelieve to be an existential threat to our democracy and \\\\ncorrosive to our core values as a Nation.\\\\n    I am referring to the pervasive, coordinated efforts \\\\nbetween our Government and private actors to influence the \\\\noutcomes of our elections.\\\\n    Whether in my role as chairman of the Center for American \\\\nLiberty, chairman of the Republican National Lawyers \\\\nAssociation, or representing 5 million California Republicans \\\\nat the Republican National Committee, it is probably the No. 1 \\\\nthing that citizens want to learn more about and do something \\\\nto stop.\\\\n    I would like to address two separate but related examples \\\\nof the ever-expanding public-private alliances directly \\\\nimpacting public trust in American elections. First, the \\\\nexpanding Government efforts to censor core political speech \\\\nonline. Second, the increasing use of private funds to run \\\\npublic election operations.\\\\n    Reporting over the last year has revealed the extensive \\\\ncoordinated efforts between Government actors, big tech, \\\\nnonprofits, and academics to identify and censor what they \\\\ncollectively deem to be, quote, ``misinformation.&#x27;&#x27; What we \\\\nknow about the scope of this Government-dictated and privately \\\\nfacilitated speech-killing machine is truly staggering, and we \\\\ncertainly do not know the full picture yet.\\\\n    An Intercept article by Ken Klippenstein and Lee Fang \\\\nreported that the Department of Homeland Security made \\\\ncombating election misinformation a top priority. The article \\\\ndescribes the formalized process that social media platforms, \\\\nincluding Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, created in the 2020 \\\\nelection, allowing Government officials to quickly flag content \\\\nfor removal and a vast network of nonprofit organizations \\\\nworking in concert with the Federal Government and social media \\\\ncompanies to police online speech.\\\\n    There is also a Missouri-Louisiana lawsuit filed by then \\\\nAttorney General Eric Schmitt and Attorney General Jeff Landry. \\\\nThe allegations rely on extensive documentation that describes \\\\nat a granular level how private social media platforms, hand in \\\\nhand with Government officials, worked together to define and \\\\nthen suppress so-called misinformation.\\\\n    The Twitter Files reporting by Matt Taibbi, Michael \\\\nShellenberger, and others--certainly not conservative \\\\njournalists--revealed extensive coordination with the FBI and \\\\nother Federal agencies. They aided the intelligence community \\\\nin its work overseas and they reveal extensive shadow banning \\\\nto limit certain opinions that are disfavored by the \\\\nGovernment. Twitter relied on Government actors and nonprofit \\\\npartners to identify the speech it then chose to censor.\\\\n    I have experienced this in my law practice. Our client, \\\\nRogan O&#x27;Handley, at the Center for American Liberty was a \\\\nvictim of Government censorship in 2020 election. The posts \\\\nthat he was censored for were core political speech about an \\\\nelection that are protected by the First Amendment of the \\\\nUnited States Constitution.\\\\n    The censorship campaign was led by a State agency with a \\\\nmission to identify and censor Government-labeled \\\\nmisinformation and then not only suppress the speech, but \\\\nsilence the speaker himself from speaking on social media.\\\\n    The State coordinated with a partisan consulting firm, \\\\nSKDKnickerbocker, which was also a consultant to the Biden \\\\ncampaign, to help with its efforts. The State coordinated with \\\\nthe National Association of Secretaries of State to develop a \\\\nspecial process for notifying social media companies what \\\\nspeech it should censor and remove from the internet.\\\\n    Communications Decency Act Section 230 has also had a major \\\\nimpact on censoring speech online. 230&#x27;s traditional editorial \\\\nfunction test has been repeatedly misinterpreted by Federal \\\\ncourts to protect social media platform censorship online. The \\\\nstatute has been weaponized by big tech to fend off lawsuits by \\\\nthose who have fallen victim to coordinated censorship \\\\ncampaigns, like Mr. O&#x27;Handley.\\\\n    Congress should act to clarify Section 230 to ensure that \\\\nit does not protect discriminatory censorship practiced by the \\\\nbig tech companies, whether in concert with Government agencies \\\\nor not.\\\\n    A lack of private cause of action against big tech for \\\\ndiscriminatory censorship is a gap in our free speech regime \\\\nand it does threaten confidence in elections.\\\\n    In conclusion, I am going to talk about Zuckerbucks.\\\\n    States are grappling with the phenomenon of so-called \\\\nZuckerbucks. This is a shorthand reference to private entities \\\\nand individuals injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into \\\\nlocal election administration battleground precincts that often \\\\ndetermine the outcomes of important races.\\\\n    It had a major impact in the 2020 election, with 2,500 \\\\nelection offices across the country receiving grants in varying \\\\namounts from CTCL and CEIR, both funded by the Zuckerberg Chan \\\\nInitiative. While a handful of State legislatures have taken \\\\naction to ban Zuckerbucks, many Governors have vetoed these \\\\nmeasures.\\\\n    Distrust in elections is not a partisan issue. Both \\\\nRepublicans and Democrats today have expressed a historic level \\\\nof distrust in our elections. I hope that a renewed commitment \\\\nby Congress to protecting freedom of speech in elections will \\\\nhelp alleviate that trend and increase public confidence in \\\\nAmerica&#x27;s elections.\\\\n    Thank you very much.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Dhillon follows:]\\\\n\\\\n            PREPARED STATEMENT OF HARMEET K. DHILLON\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Thank you, Ms. Dhillon.\\\\n    I now recognize you, Ms. Audrey Perry Martin, 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n                STATEMENT OF AUDREY PERRY MARTIN\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Martin. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Steil and \\\\nRanking Member Morelle, for having me today. I appreciate this \\\\nopportunity to talk about the critical importance of protecting \\\\npolitical speech in U.S. elections.\\\\n    I want to focus my comments today on the necessary and \\\\nprimarily nonpartisan modernization changes outlined in Section \\\\n3 of the ACE Act and the importance of updating Federal \\\\ncampaign finance laws to put them in line with our modern era.\\\\n    Although campaign finance policy is the subject of intense \\\\ndebate and public interest, current Federal campaign finance \\\\nlaws are woefully outdated. Significant changes have occurred \\\\nin campaign finance policy, in technology, and in the political \\\\nlandscape since the last time Congress passed a substantial \\\\namendment to the campaign finance law over 20 years ago with \\\\nthe Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, or BCRA.\\\\n    Since 2002, Congress has only made really minor changes to \\\\nFederal statutes, although the Federal Election Commission has \\\\nattempted to fill this gap with regulations.\\\\n    Many provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of \\\\n1971, or FECA, need modernization to keep the law in line with \\\\ncurrent political realities.\\\\n    First, most campaign finance reports filed with the Federal \\\\nElection Commission, or the FEC, are required to be done \\\\nelectronically for anyone who is raising or spending over \\\\n$50,000. However, electioneering communication reports are not \\\\ncurrently required to be filed electronically.\\\\n    This does not make a lot of sense in our modern era. \\\\nReports that are filed electronically are available much sooner \\\\nto voters and it is a lot easier for staff to process them.\\\\n    Second, the lack of legislation focused specifically on \\\\nonline campaign activity has led to much uncertainty in the \\\\nregulated community about how to report communications made \\\\nover the internet and what type of disclaimers are required for \\\\ninternet political ads.\\\\n    This issue has not just affected campaigns and political \\\\ncommittees. Private citizens expressing their opinion over the \\\\ninternet can unknowingly run afoul of Federal campaign finance \\\\nlaws by expressing their political views online.\\\\n    As a result, it has been left to the FEC to attempt to \\\\nmodernize these rules through the regulatory process. Although \\\\nsomewhat helpful, this regulation did not address several \\\\nimportant issues.\\\\n    The ACE Act addresses most of these issues. The bill \\\\ncodifies the FEC&#x27;s 2006 internet rulemaking by exempting unpaid \\\\ninternet communications from the definition of a contribution \\\\nand expenditure, even when they are coordinated with a \\\\ncandidate.\\\\n    Furthermore, the ACE Act expands the media exemption to \\\\ninclude electronic and internet-based news companies, clearing \\\\nup confusion over which companies were eligible for the \\\\nexemption.\\\\n    Under this Act, a news organization that is not owned or \\\\ncontrolled by a party, a political committee, or a candidate \\\\nshould qualify for the media exemption.\\\\n    These technical amendments to the FECA are needed to \\\\nmodernize the law for the current era.\\\\n    Third, the proposed bill updates the law to align with \\\\ninflation. Under FECA, certain contribution limits are indexed \\\\nfor inflation every 2 years based on the change in the cost of \\\\nliving.\\\\n    However, not all of them are, and FECA does not tie the \\\\nqualifying threshold for political committee qualification. \\\\nRapid inflation in the past decades resulted in an extremely \\\\nlow qualification threshold for filing reports with the FEC.\\\\n    For example, under current law, an entity will become a \\\\npolitical committee after spending only $1,000 to support a \\\\ncandidate. This is not indexed for inflation, so every year it \\\\ngets worse.\\\\n    The proposed bill addresses these outdated limits by \\\\nincreasing them and tying the qualification thresholds to \\\\ninflation, avoiding the need for Congress to address this again \\\\nin 20 years. This would help avoid chilling grassroots \\\\npolitical speech by setting too low of a trigger to qualify as \\\\na committee or to file FEC reports.\\\\n    Finally, Section 3 of the ACE Act includes several \\\\nadditional significant nonpartisan changes. It implements the \\\\nFEC legislative recommendations to make permanent the extension \\\\nof administrative finds for qualified disclosure requirement \\\\nviolation, which for years has just been extended temporarily.\\\\n    It raises the annual rate of pay for staff and adjusts it \\\\nfor inflation in the same manner as other positions in the \\\\nExecutive Schedule, allowing the FEC to attract and retain \\\\nqualified employees.\\\\n    It also clears up the rules regarding what happens if a \\\\ncandidate dies and no one is at the helm of the campaign. It \\\\ncodifies recent Supreme Court decisions, simplifies joint \\\\nfundraising, and sunsets the unused Presidential public funding \\\\nprogram.\\\\n    Current Federal campaign finance laws need to be updated \\\\nand require modernization to keep up with the changing \\\\npolitical and technological landscape of our day. The \\\\nmodernizing sections of the ACE Act are a critical update to \\\\nFederal election law to address these important issues.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Martin follows:]\\\\n\\\\n           PREPARED STATEMENT OF AUDREY PERRY MARTIN \\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Steil.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the \\\\nCommittee. I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss overdue \\\\nreforms to help strengthen our Nation&#x27;s local and State \\\\npolitical parties.\\\\n    As former chief counsel to the RNC, I saw firsthand how \\\\ncampaign finance restrictions are hollowing out our State \\\\nparties. This is bad for our political system, but fortunately \\\\neven modest reforms can provide meaningful relief, ensure \\\\nbetter legal compliance, and decrease political polarization.\\\\n    BCRA weakened our local parties by choking off their \\\\nability to fundraise and engage in grassroots political \\\\nprograms and saddling them with Byzantine regulations.\\\\n    Do not take my word for it. Experts from across the \\\\nideological spectrum know both the positive role parties play \\\\nin our system and how BCRA weakens them.\\\\n    A few suggestions on how Congress can help.\\\\n    First, State parties have suffered because their ability to \\\\nfundraise has steadily eroded since the enactment of BCRA in \\\\n2003. This is due to Congress&#x27; failure to index for inflation \\\\nwhen setting State party contribution limits, even though it \\\\ndid do so for national parties and Federal candidates.\\\\n    State parties today are stuck with the same $10,000 \\\\ncontribution limit they were in 2003. Not indexing for \\\\ninflation means that a $10,000 contribution made in 2003 is \\\\nworth just over $6,000 today. For comparison, in 2003 the \\\\nnational party committees had $25,000 limits and today they are \\\\nover $41,000.\\\\n    BCRA left State parties behind at the same time the law \\\\nimposed other fundraising and spending restrictions. Meanwhile, \\\\ncampaign costs have increased, even when accounting for \\\\ninflation, due to numerous factors, including increased early \\\\nand mail voting.\\\\n    Yes, the emergence of super-PACs has contributed to \\\\nincreased spending and helped reduce parties&#x27; influence, but \\\\ntheir inability to remain competitive preceded Citizens United.\\\\n    Congress should raise State party limits and account for \\\\ninflation or these disparities will only grow worse. There is \\\\nlittle downside since State parties are also one of our most \\\\ntransparent political entities.\\\\n    There is another reform that would help. State parties are \\\\npermitted to have separate State election accounts which in \\\\ntheory should help them remain competitive. BCRA&#x27;s \\\\nfederalization of our elections has made these accounts largely \\\\nirrelevant.\\\\n    BCRA requires State parties to fund most of their \\\\nactivities in Federal election years from their already \\\\ninflation-depleted Federal accounts. This includes voter \\\\nregistration drives and basic Get Out the Vote activities that \\\\ndo not even reference a Federal candidate. Thus, a State party \\\\nwith few or no competitive Federal races but several State and \\\\nlocal ones must use only Federal funds even if they are flush \\\\nwith State dollars.\\\\n    Compliance with these regulations is also difficult, State \\\\nparties are the most regulated political entities in our system \\\\nbecause they have to comply with both State and Federal \\\\ncampaign finance laws. Ironically, BCRA made things the most \\\\ncomplicated for the least resourced political committees.\\\\n    It is hard to fathom how any of this prevents corruption. \\\\nIn practice, it only stifles parties&#x27; ability to engage in core \\\\nFirst Amendment-protected speech and time-honored grassroots \\\\nactivities.\\\\n    It is common sense to reduce these regulatory burdens by \\\\nnot only raising contribution limits, but also giving State \\\\nparties flexibility in financing these grassroots activities. \\\\n2022&#x27;s ACE Act would have done just that by exempting certain \\\\nState party functions from Federal regulations so long as they \\\\nwere not coordinating with candidates.\\\\n    Finally, another overdue reform would be to increase the \\\\nspending threshold for when local grassroots organizations must \\\\nregister and report to the FEC. For example, groups must do so \\\\nif they spend more than $1,000 in supporting Federal candidates \\\\nin a year. Like the State party limits, this threshold has \\\\nremained static and unindexed for inflation, in this case since \\\\nthe early 1970&#x27;s.\\\\n    Compliance is also unrealistic. I am sure there are dozens \\\\nof local groups out there that have unwittingly triggered these \\\\nlimits and have not reported, nor can the FEC police \\\\nenforcement.\\\\n    No wonder both Democrat and Republican FEC Commissioners \\\\nhave consistently called on Congress to raise those limits and \\\\nindex them.\\\\n    This would avoid entrapping local groups that raise and \\\\nspend comparatively little but are still important participants \\\\nin our political process.\\\\n    These are all seemingly technical issues in the overall \\\\ncampaign finance landscape, but I can assure you, as a \\\\npractitioner in this area, they are important.\\\\n    State and local parties are essential to our political \\\\nsystem. Not only do they allow Americans to come together and \\\\nexercise their First Amendment rights, they are also \\\\ninstrumental in nominating and electing our future \\\\nofficeholders.\\\\n    Even the Brennan Center, an organization I rarely agree \\\\nwith, noted in its call to ease these burdens that parties are \\\\nan essential element of our democracy and a moderating force \\\\nresponsive to public opinion.\\\\n    Easing regulatory burdens on them will not solve all of \\\\ntheir problems, but it will give them a fighting chance.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Riemer follows:]\\\\n\\\\n              PREPARED STATEMENT OF JUSTIN RIEMER \\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. Riemer.\\\\n    Mr. Smith, I understand your flight just made it in on \\\\ntime, so we appreciate you hustling to be with us today. You \\\\nare now recognized, Mr. Smith, for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n                 STATEMENT OF BRADLEY A. SMITH\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Chairman Steil and Ranking Member \\\\nMorelle and Members of the Committee.\\\\n    Campaign finance is fundamentally different from most \\\\nGovernment regulation in the sense that it concerns the heart \\\\nof democratic self-governance: when and how we discuss issues \\\\nof public policy and public affairs and candidates for office.\\\\n    For that reason, the Supreme Court has noted that the First \\\\nAmendment has its fullest and most urgent application precisely \\\\nto the conduct of campaigns for political office. I would add \\\\nto that broader discussion again of public affairs and issues.\\\\n    The Government should not constrain the right of the \\\\nAmerican people to discuss candidates and politics lightly. The \\\\nSupreme Court has recognized only one permissible grounds for \\\\nrestricting speech--political speech--and that is the \\\\nprevention of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance, and \\\\nconstantly rejected attempts to restrict campaign speech based \\\\non other legislative aims.\\\\n    The ACE Act legislation should begin as it does by \\\\nmodifying and modernizing the disclosure regime and simplifying \\\\nregulation. In the 2022 midterms, the average candidate for the \\\\nU.S. Senate raised about $13.8 million, the average candidate \\\\nfor the U.S. House about $1.8 million. On top of this, you have \\\\nabout $7.4 billion spent by Federal political action committees \\\\nand another $1.1 billion by independent expenditures.\\\\n    In order to prevent people from improperly influencing \\\\ncandidates, contributions are limited to $3,300 per election. \\\\nAny group of people that bands together to talk with the major \\\\npurpose of defeating one or more Federal candidates or electing \\\\none or more such candidates and spends more than $1,000 is \\\\nrequired to register and file burdensome reports with the \\\\nFederal Election Commission. Anyone spending money to \\\\nindependently try to elect or defeat a Federal candidate has to \\\\nfile at just $250.\\\\n    Now, to the average citizen even $250 seems like a pretty \\\\ngood chunk of change, let alone $5,000 that a group might \\\\ncontribute as a PAC. In the context of a $1.8 million House \\\\ncampaign, it is hard to envision that this has any corrupting \\\\neffect on the Members of this Committee or their colleagues on \\\\nthe House.\\\\n    These numbers, we should note, have not been adjusted even \\\\nfor inflation since the 1970&#x27;s, these numbers on disclosure, \\\\nwhich includes donors of as little as $200.\\\\n    Now, free societies thrive on the public exchange of ideas. \\\\nThe First Amendment protects not only the brave, but it also \\\\nprotects the meek, the weak, and minorities of all kind.\\\\n    For example, today we see people often publicly hounded for \\\\ntheir association with groups, sometimes years in the past, \\\\nthat have for one reason or another become controversial. I \\\\ncould just give one high-profile example or I could give many \\\\nothers, including examples of people who we would view as much \\\\nmore ordinary citizens.\\\\n    The high-profile example would be California&#x27;s Proposition \\\\n8, which passed in 2008 in California, a very liberal State, \\\\nrepresenting the votes of over 7 million people.\\\\n    Now, whether one agrees with the proposition or not, it was \\\\nhardly outside of mainstream political discourse in 2008. Yet, \\\\nnearly 6 years later, Mozilla CEO and founder Brendan Eich was \\\\npressured into resigning from his company due to the \\\\ncontroversy surrounding a small contribution of $1,000 he had \\\\npreviously made supporting Proposition 8, again, close to a \\\\ndecade before.\\\\n    If anything, our political culture is becoming more \\\\nunforgiving in the decade since Mr. Eich&#x27;s resignation. Faced \\\\nwith this minefield, many people will simply refrain from \\\\nsupporting political or policy groups rather than risk the \\\\nbacklash that may come years later. These low reporting \\\\nthresholds and excessive reporting requirements chill protected \\\\nspeech.\\\\n    Now, we should also note that disclosure of public debate \\\\nhas been sanctioned by the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court \\\\nhas never sanctioned disclosure of anything related to public \\\\naffairs or political issue discussion.\\\\n    It has only sanctioned disclosure in the context of \\\\npolitical committees; that is, organizations that exist for the \\\\nprimary purpose of electing or defeating candidates for office \\\\nor for speech which is expressly advocating the election or \\\\ndefeat of those candidates or its functional equivalent.\\\\n    Talk about dark money seems to hide this. We should note \\\\nthat so-called dark money consists of well under 5 percent of \\\\ntotal spending in Federal political races. Most of that dark \\\\nmoney is, in fact, relatively well-known to people.\\\\n    For example, large dark money groups, groups that identify \\\\nas dark money groups, include the Natural Resources Defense \\\\nCouncil, the National Association of Realtors, the U.S. Chamber \\\\nof Commerce. I do not think that most Americans are scratching \\\\ntheir heads desperately trying to figure out what the U.S. \\\\nChamber of Commerce or the Natural Resources Defense Council \\\\nstand for.\\\\n    In the end, I think the ACE Act makes good steps. One thing \\\\nthat I would emphasize here as I conclude is that it is \\\\nimportant for the ACE Act to get out of the campaign finance \\\\nregulation business, other agencies, such as the Internal \\\\nRevenue Service, which led to the Tea Party scandal, the SEC or \\\\nthe FCC, and leave this to the agency designated by statute to \\\\ninterpret campaign finance law, the FEC.\\\\n    Thank you for your time. I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Smith follows:]\\\\n\\\\n             PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRADLEY A. SMITH\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. Smith.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n                 STATEMENT OF STEPHEN SPAULDING\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Good morning, Chairman Steil, Ranking Member \\\\nMorelle, distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for \\\\nthe opportunity to be here this morning.\\\\n    Our north star must be a democracy that lives up to its \\\\npromise, one where everyone participates and everyone is heard. \\\\nIt is why we have the freedom to vote.\\\\n    The late great American hero, Representative John Lewis, \\\\nsaid it best: ``It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have \\\\nin a democratic society.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    The freedom to vote is political speech. It is the power to \\\\nhave a voice in our democracy. Political speech has been under \\\\nattack. Voter suppression, gerrymandering, and the undue \\\\ninfluence of big money in politics form a trifecta that \\\\nsilences voters.\\\\n    Today we are focusing on money in politics. The Supreme \\\\nCourt&#x27;s decisions in Citizens United and McCutcheon ripped a \\\\nmassive tear in the fabric of laws that Congress passed to stop \\\\ncorruption and bring transparency to our elections.\\\\n    Just a hundred people, enough to fit into this hearing \\\\nroom, contributed nearly three-quarters of the $1.2 billion \\\\npeople contributed to super-PACs in the last cycle. Put another \\\\nway, a hundred people pumped 60 percent more money into our \\\\nelections than millions of small donors combined.\\\\n    This money is coming from a tiny and highly unrepresented \\\\nsegment of the public. Americans have good reason to think that \\\\ntheir voices are being drowned out. It is made worse because \\\\nmuch of it is undisclosed.\\\\n    Since Citizens United, according to the nonpartisan Open \\\\nSecrets, at least $3 of every $10 in outside spending reported \\\\nto the FEC since Citizens United can be traced to dark money \\\\ngroups.\\\\n    Justice Kennedy wrote in Citizens United, in a provision to \\\\nthe opinion that had the support of eight out of nine Justices, \\\\nthat, quote, ``Disclosure enables the electorate to make \\\\ninformed decisions and give proper weight to speakers and \\\\nmessages and lets voters make informed choices in the political \\\\nmarketplace.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Transparency in campaign spending protects voters&#x27; right to \\\\nknow who is speaking to them and who is trying to influence \\\\ntheir votes on election day so that they can give proper weight \\\\nto different speakers and messages, as Justice Kennedy wrote. \\\\nIt stops corruption. It makes sure we can enforce our finance \\\\nlaws in the first place.\\\\n    Consider a scandal that has rocked Ohio. Imagine you are an \\\\nexecutive at a power company on the verge of bankruptcy. If you \\\\ncan spend the company&#x27;s money to elect some handpicked \\\\ncandidates to the statehouse, including the Speaker of the \\\\nHouse, you have a good chance of securing an eye-popping return \\\\non your investment, like a billion-dollar bailout of two of \\\\nyour power plants. One of your lobbyists slips a $400,000 check \\\\nacross the table to further the scheme, made out to the dark \\\\nmoney group controlled by the future Speaker.\\\\n    This is not just made up. In March, a former Speaker of the \\\\nOhio House of Representatives was convicted in a racketeering \\\\ntrial that involved $60 million in bribes in exchange for a \\\\n$1.3 billion power plant bailout. Ohioans could not follow the \\\\nmoney to get to the root of the scandal. It does not have to be \\\\nthis way and it is solvable and there is momentum in the \\\\nStates.\\\\n    Take Arizona. Just last fall, voters there approved the \\\\nVoters&#x27; Right to Know Act by a vote of 72 percent to 27 percent \\\\nin Arizona so that Arizonans can see who is behind big campaign \\\\nspenders there.\\\\n    The House has passed the DISCLOSE Act several times to \\\\nshine a light on secret money in elections. It is also passed \\\\nthe bipartisan Honest Ads Act to help voters know who is behind \\\\npolitical advertisements they see online.\\\\n    Of course these were all passed as part of the Freedom to \\\\nVote Act, a bill that puts people first.\\\\n    They stand in sharp contrast to the ACE Act as introduced \\\\nlast Congress. Provisions in the ACE Act would open the door to \\\\nmore secret money in our elections and further empower the \\\\nwealthy few to spend even more money purchasing access and \\\\ninfluence.\\\\n    The other day I was looking at the most recent turnout \\\\nstatistics that came out from the Census Bureau. About half of \\\\neligible voters sat out the election last year. In 2020, a high \\\\nwater mark for turnout, roughly a third of eligible voters sat \\\\nit out. Their political speech went unspoken at the ballot box.\\\\n    As we hold ourselves out as democracy&#x27;s gold standard, we \\\\nhave to do more to ensure that everyone can participate and \\\\neveryone can be heard, where our Government is representative \\\\nand reflective and responsive to the people that it serves. \\\\nThat is what will strengthen confidence in elections and \\\\nvindicate the most fundamental freedom that we have--the \\\\nfreedom of one person, one vote.\\\\n    Thank you, Chairman Steil.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Spaulding follows:]\\\\n\\\\n            PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHEN SPAULDING\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. Spaulding.\\\\n    I will now recognize Mr. Griffith for 5 minutes for the \\\\npurpose of asking the witnesses questions.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I greatly appreciate \\\\nthat.\\\\n    I will ask this to all witnesses today. It is almost 10 \\\\nyears to the day after the fateful announcement by Lois Lerner \\\\nof the IRS that the agency was disfavoring groups when granting \\\\ntax-exempt status. While Congress has passed language on a \\\\nbipartisan basis each year since 2013 to prevent another Lois \\\\nLerner situation, it is time to make those protections \\\\npermanent.\\\\n    Would you agree? I will start with you, Ms. Dhillon. Yes or \\\\nno?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Yes, sir, I do agree.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. Ms. Martin?\\\\n    Ms. Martin. I do agree, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. Mr. Riemer?\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. I do, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. Mr. Smith?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. 501(c)(4)&#x27;s should not be vehicles for dark \\\\nmoney in our elections.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. You agree.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. I agree that 501(c)(4)&#x27;s have been abused, \\\\nparticularly after Citizens United, to form dark money----\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. Do you agree or disagree? I am just trying to \\\\nget a yes or no.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. I believe that 501(c)(4)&#x27;s have an important \\\\nrole to play to promote social welfare----\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. I am going to take that as a no. Unless you \\\\nsay yes, I am taking it as a no. OK? All right.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. What they shouldn&#x27;t be is avenues to cloak \\\\ndark money spending.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. I will move on to the next question.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. They should be promoting social welfare.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. Mr. Riemer, I am going to agree with you, \\\\nbecause you said it in your opening statement. I had it written \\\\ndown as a question, so I am going to rearrange it a little bit.\\\\n    State parties are the most highly regulated organizations \\\\nin the political sphere. We have so severely limited how they \\\\ncan operate that in some States they barely exist.\\\\n    I agree with you that we should remove restrictions on \\\\nState parties that do not make sense and put States on a solid \\\\nfooting to be able to organize voters and support their \\\\ncandidates without the heavy weight of the Federal Government.\\\\n    I say that having been a 17-year member of the Virginia \\\\nState Central Committee of the Republican Party. I saw a lot of \\\\nthis happening over time.\\\\n    That being said, I note in the ACE Act, so would like to \\\\nget your thoughts on this, that it looks like even in the ACE \\\\nAct the penalties are higher on a State and local party that \\\\nviolate the rules, but the penalties are higher than they are \\\\non a foreign national who violates the rules.\\\\n    Do you think that is right?\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. I am not familiar with that particular \\\\nprovision, Congressman.\\\\n    I mean, the fact of the matter is these State and local \\\\norganizations have a hard enough time paying any FEC \\\\nenforcement fees or anything like that. I mean, it is very \\\\ndifficult for them. They do not have much money to begin with.\\\\n    I think the punishment should be reflective of the \\\\ninfraction, and I think oftentimes it is not.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. Yes. I think that is true. I think you \\\\ntouched on this in your opening as well.\\\\n    A lot of times, particularly with the local party \\\\nofficials, they are just doing the best job they can. That does \\\\nnot mean that there should not be some kind of a sanction if \\\\nthey violate the rules, but it ought to be rational and based \\\\non what their mental State was and whether or not it was \\\\nsomething they were doing to play games, to try to do things \\\\nthey were not supposed to do, or whether it was the mere fact \\\\nthat they just did not understand and it was confusing.\\\\n    I think you have stated and you can elaborate more that we \\\\nneed to make these laws and rules related to local and State \\\\nparties easy to understand so they do not inadvertently cross \\\\nsome tripwire.\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. Absolutely, Congressman.\\\\n    As I have mentioned, the State parties are the most \\\\nregulated entity, and they have to deal with this sort of Venn \\\\ndiagram of Federal and State law and having to comply with \\\\nboth.\\\\n    At the RNC we really do not have to do that. We are \\\\nbasically a Federal committee and it is regulated by Federal \\\\nlaw, but the States have to deal with both. Even where those \\\\ntwo things come together there is all sorts of blurry lines and \\\\nit is just--it is almost impossible for them.\\\\n    I can tell you that, in dealing with dozens of State and \\\\nlocal parties over the years, that any FEC issues that I have \\\\nseen, noncompliance or whatever, have been out of maybe a lack \\\\nof sophistication, inability to hire expert compliance people, \\\\nattorneys, to get them through this stuff. It is just--it is \\\\ndifficult.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. That is why I suspect you would favor having \\\\na legal fund for the State parties and a building fund, one, so \\\\nthat they can be better educated and prepared for the rules and \\\\nregulations that are reasonable.\\\\n    Two, if anybody&#x27;s been to the Obenshain building in the \\\\nlast 10 years, which is, for those who do not know, it is the \\\\nState party headquarters in Virginia, there are parts of it I \\\\nam not sure are safe anymore. Would you agree with that?\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. I agree with you, Congressman. I have been in \\\\nmany State party headquarters across the country and--well, I \\\\ndo not need to say any more. They are in rough shape.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. You would agree that having a building fund \\\\nand a legal fund would both benefit the following of the law \\\\nand benefit the State parties even to a minimal extent of \\\\nkeeping their property in a better fashion.\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. Absolutely. There is no reason why you should \\\\nnot allow the State parties to have these additional accounts. \\\\nThey are not being used for TV ads. They are not being using \\\\nfor anything that needs to be further regulated. Litigation has \\\\nbecome a much bigger concern on both sides of the aisle, \\\\nwhether it is them being sued for something or needing to hire \\\\ncompliance attorneys.\\\\n    I think it is an absolutely great idea.\\\\n    Mr. Griffith. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \\\\nAppreciate it.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, is recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank all of you for being here, for testifying, for your \\\\nparticipation today and in the electoral process.\\\\n    In terms of full disclosure, I am a former county \\\\nDemocratic Party chairman. I served for 9 years. Much of I \\\\nthink what was said by the witnesses I think we could put \\\\ntogether in a bipartisan approach to addressing some of the \\\\nthings that you raise, which I think are reasonable.\\\\n    I would, however, since the bottom line rationale for the \\\\nhearing was to talk about free speech and disclosure and \\\\ntransparency, I do want to focus on that.\\\\n    Before I do that, I want to just ask Ms. Dhillon, did Joe \\\\nBiden win the 2020 Presidential election?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Joe Biden is the President of the United \\\\nStates, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. That is not the question I asked you. Did he \\\\nwin the Presidential election?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. He won a deeply flawed election. Yes, he is \\\\nthe President.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. I am sorry. I did not hear that.\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. He won a deeply flawed election. He is the \\\\nPresident of the United States.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. He won the election.\\\\n    Ms. Martin, did Joe Biden win the 2020 Presidential \\\\nelection?\\\\n    Ms. Martin. He did. He is the President.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Mr. Riemer--did I pronounce that right, sir?\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Did Joe Biden win the 2020 election?\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. Yes.\\\\n    Professor Smith?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Did Joe Biden win the 2020 election?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Mr. Spaulding, did Joe Biden win the 2020 \\\\nPresidential election?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Yes, fair and square.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding, the Supreme Court observed in Buckley: \\\\nSafeguarding the ability of the citizenry to make informed \\\\nchoices among candidates for office is crucial.\\\\n    Can you expand on the value that transparency and \\\\ndisclosure requirements have in aiding the electorate? Because \\\\nthis is ultimately about giving the tools to voters to make \\\\ninformed decisions. Can you just expand upon that?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Absolutely. Thank you, Ranking Member \\\\nMorelle.\\\\n    That is exactly what the Court said in Citizens United, as \\\\nI mentioned, in a provision of the opinion that was endorsed \\\\neight to one, that when they were going to declare this First \\\\nAmendment right of corporations to spend unlimited amounts of \\\\nmoney in politics, Justice Kennedy essentially wrote: Do not \\\\nworry about the corruption interest there because it will be \\\\ndisclosed. The electorate will be able to evaluate the strength \\\\nof messages, will be able to evaluate who is speaking. Actually \\\\ntalked about shareholders being able to hold corporations \\\\naccountable.\\\\n    I think he said something about how until today a \\\\ndisclosure regime essentially has not existed to shine a light \\\\non politics.\\\\n    It still has not existed. Thirteen years after the \\\\ndecision, our disclosure laws have not kept pace with how money \\\\nis spent in elections. It has deprived voters of their First \\\\nAmendment interest in knowing who is speaking to them, in \\\\nknowing who is behind the messages that they are seeing online.\\\\n    The other thing I will point out too is there are secret \\\\nspenders who know where the money--recipients of secret \\\\nspending who know where that money is coming from. Look at that \\\\nOhio example with the former Ohio Speaker of the House who was \\\\nindicted. He knew exactly where that $60 million was coming \\\\nfrom. It was coming from a power company that was backing in \\\\npart his election and in people to the statehouse that would \\\\nsupport his role as Speaker and eventually as part of a \\\\nbillion-dollar bailout for the power company.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Well, let me expand on that. The bill that has \\\\nbeen referenced, the ACE Act, would loosen disclosure \\\\nrequirements. In your opinion, the example you cited, would the \\\\nenactment of the ACE Act make it more or less likely that the \\\\nexample you have cited could be replicated?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Well, given that the ACE Act is dealing with \\\\nFederal elections, it would absolutely curb the chance of that \\\\nhappening at the Federal level.\\\\n    There are provisions of this bill, I mean, Section 325, \\\\nrepeal requirement of persons making independent expenditures \\\\nto report the identification of certain donors. Section 341, \\\\nprohibit regulations on political contributions. Directs the \\\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission to not finalize, issue, \\\\nimplement any rule, regulation, or other order regarding the \\\\ndisclosure of political contributions.\\\\n    That directly contravenes what Justice Kennedy wrote in \\\\nCitizens United, which was about shareholders being able to \\\\nhold their corporations accountable through disclosure. This \\\\nbill would be a big step backward in that respect.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Thank you for that.\\\\n    I did note, and I will, because my seconds are quickly \\\\nticking away, but, Mr. Smith, you had indicated that it is not \\\\nonly trying to protect the home of the brave, but you said the \\\\nhome of the meek and others.\\\\n    It seems to me that many of the people putting hundreds of \\\\nmillions of dollars or billions of dollars into dark money and \\\\ntrying to influence elections without disclosure hardly would \\\\nbe termed the meek.\\\\n    I would just finish by saying, certainly some of the low-\\\\nlevel amounts that you have talked about I think could be \\\\nraised. I think there is a way to reach this in a bipartisan \\\\nconsensus.\\\\n    The real, real, real threat to American democracy remains \\\\nlarge, large amounts of money being put into American elections \\\\nwithout any disclosure and the presence of dark money, and I \\\\npersonally want to make sure that that does not happen.\\\\n    With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Loudermilk, is recognized \\\\nfor 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you all for being here today.\\\\n    First question. Ms. Dhillon, are Americans who donate to \\\\nnonprofit organizations receiving the protection they deserve \\\\nunder the law today?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Well, I think a lot of donors are deterred \\\\nfrom making donations when they look at the Lois Lerner \\\\nexample.\\\\n    Indeed, even though protections for donor privacy date back \\\\nto the NAACP era and concerns by African Americans of hounding \\\\nby their Government, today it is donors across the board, but \\\\nmostly conservatives, who are concerned that if they express \\\\ntheir political speech through contributions to nonprofits that \\\\nare disfavored by the Government in power or State actors, what \\\\nhave you, they will be punished for their speech through \\\\naudits, investigations, harassment, et cetera. The last couple \\\\nof decades in our country have provided many examples of that.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Well, I appreciate that.\\\\n    It is interesting you brought up Lois Lerner. I think we \\\\nare in about a decade now, 10 years since that was made public.\\\\n    With that in mind, besides Government intimidation, is not \\\\nthere a real possibility that donor lists that feature the \\\\nnames, addresses, and sometimes contribution amounts might be \\\\nleaked to the public?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Not only is there a possibility, we have seen \\\\nthis happen. With the acceleration of mob-type behavior through \\\\nsocial media, it can put donors at real risk when their privacy \\\\nis not respected. This should not be the case when donors are \\\\ncontributing to legitimate nonprofit ends.\\\\n    I think it is critical, and I say this as the CEO of a \\\\nnonprofit, to encourage and protect core First Amendment speech \\\\nthrough contributions to nonprofits, that donor privacy be \\\\nrespected.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Especially in this woke culture that we \\\\nfind ourselves--or cancel culture, I should say--where \\\\nretribution has been and is taken on to people because of their \\\\npolitical beliefs, their religious beliefs, their thoughts.\\\\n    That is totally outside of the scope of American ideas and \\\\nprinciples, is that you do have a right, not only to free \\\\nspeech but right to thoughts and beliefs. Our Government and \\\\nour laws are set up to punish bad behavior, not thought.\\\\n    In an instance like the leak that you have described that \\\\ncauses hundreds, if not thousands of Americans to be harassed \\\\nfor the crime of giving money to groups that they agree with, \\\\nis there not personal risk in that as well? I mean, we have \\\\nseen incidents where people have lost their jobs because of \\\\nsomething that they posted on social media.\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Absolutely. I would say not only have people \\\\nlost their jobs, they have lost job opportunities. They have \\\\nbeen forced to retreat from their homes due to mob threats. \\\\nThis is a bipartisan problem, and so I think that everyone \\\\nshould have an interest in donor privacy for these reasons.\\\\n    Cancel culture run amok, accelerated by social media and by \\\\nthe heavy hand of Government acting in concert with social \\\\nmedia, is a significant risk to First Amendment speech in the \\\\nUnited States, both with respect to donations to nonprofits as \\\\nwell as, I would say, simply people expressing their views, \\\\nexpressing their right to consume or participate in a free \\\\npress, to gather together. Every aspect of the First Amendment \\\\nis under threat through these types of issues that we are \\\\ndiscussing here today.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. I have heard from constituents myself they \\\\nare afraid to get involved in politics, and this has just come \\\\nabout in the last 3 to 4 years, and especially donate, because \\\\nthey are afraid that their name may be disclosed, even if they \\\\ngave to an individual candidate, not as much as what the \\\\nGovernment may do, but what others may do in putting pressure \\\\non their employers.\\\\n    In fact, I know a firsthand account, a gentleman right now \\\\nwho has already lost a job because his identity was, in my \\\\nopinion, illegally disclosed by the January 6th Committee for \\\\ndoing nothing wrong, and he cannot get a job at this point.\\\\n    In this culture that we live in is to punish people who do \\\\nnot agree with you politically. That is really what it comes \\\\ndown to.\\\\n    In your opinion, is the end goal of all this to ensure that \\\\nthese groups never receive funding again because of donor fear \\\\nthat their personal information might be disclosed to the \\\\npublic? Is that the end goal?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. It is certainly a goal. Ironically, what we \\\\nhave seen in California, a liberal jurisdiction, is it actually \\\\nhas a very good law with respect to employment, which protects \\\\nindividuals from political retribution on the basis of their \\\\npolitical viewpoints or associations. I think that that is a \\\\nlaudable statute that should actually be replicated in many \\\\nother States.\\\\n    At the end of the day, the use of--the exposure of donor \\\\ninformation poses a significant risk nationally to liberty and \\\\nprivacy.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. That information is used for intimidation.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Ms. Sewell is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Sewell. First, I would like to thank our witnesses for \\\\ntheir testimonies today.\\\\n    As the Ranking Member of the Elections Subcommittee and as \\\\nthe author of the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement \\\\nAct, ensuring that Americans have the resources they need to \\\\nmake well-informed decisions at the polls is something that I \\\\nam deeply, deeply concerned about.\\\\n    Voting is a cornerstone of our democracy, and for far too \\\\nlong States have placed barriers in front of the ballot box. \\\\nAccording to a recent study by the Brennan Center, State \\\\nlawmakers in at least 32 States pre-filed or introduced 150 \\\\nrestrictive voting bills. These bills create stricter voter ID \\\\nlaws, cut voting times, restrict registration, and purge voter \\\\nrolls. The bills also make it harder for people of color, poor \\\\npeople, young people, disabled people, elderly people, to have \\\\naccess to their right to vote.\\\\n    Campaign spending has swayed elections in the last 13 years \\\\nby allowing secret donors to funnel over $1 billion into \\\\nelections that are influencing the way voters vote and picking \\\\nwinners and losers.\\\\n    In 2014, Energy 2002, Arizona&#x27;s biggest utility company, \\\\npaid more than $10 million for attack ads that helped defeat \\\\nconsumer-oriented candidates for a seat on a State commission \\\\nthat oversees the State utilities. As a result, residents saw a \\\\ngrave price hike shortly after the new commission was \\\\nestablished.\\\\n    Voters deserve transparency, I think all of us should be \\\\nbehind that, based on the facts and not on disinformation. \\\\nVoters have a right to know who the secret funders are that may \\\\nbe influencing candidates&#x27; political interests.\\\\n    There is a common misconception, however, that by hiding \\\\ndark money we are helping to shield donors from some sort of \\\\nharm or their privacy being invaded. Those that support that \\\\noften use the NAACP v. Alabama case as a point to prove this \\\\npoint.\\\\n    NAACP v. Alabama was a 1958 case. It was based on the fact \\\\nthat in 1956 the Alabama Secretary of State required the NAACP \\\\nto disclose the names and addresses of all of its Members in \\\\nthe State. Again, this is 1958.\\\\n    The NAACP refused to release those membership lists because \\\\nthey feared that members would be in danger of losing their \\\\nlives. The Supreme Court agreed with the NAACP because Black \\\\ncivil rights activists faced severe threats from raids of Ku \\\\nKlux Klan members that included the church bombings, shooting \\\\nup their houses, and shooting them as they drove, rode on buses \\\\nand in taxis.\\\\n    NAACP v. Alabama, I believe, is not the blueprint for \\\\nhiding information on who wealthy donors, special interest \\\\ngroups, and corporations are funneling money into campaigns \\\\nbehind the scenes.\\\\n    In fact, would like to move for unanimous consent, Mr. \\\\nChairman, to submit an article for the record. That article is \\\\n``One of These Things Is Not Like the Other: The NAACP v. \\\\nAlabama is Not a Manual for Powerful, Wealthy Spenders to Pour \\\\nUnlimited Secret Money Into Our Political Process,&#x27;&#x27; end quote.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Without objection.\\\\n    [The NAACP v. Alabama article referred to follows:]\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Sewell. Thank you, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding, you spent your time and your testimony \\\\ntalking about the Citizens United case. The Citizens United \\\\ncase, as it was decided, really has allowed, as you said, at \\\\nleast $3 out of every $10 in outside money since Citizens \\\\nUnited can be traced to dark money.\\\\n    What impact does a deluge of undisclosed electoral funding \\\\nhave on the information available to voters? Why should this be \\\\nsafeguarded?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Thank you, Ms. Sewell.\\\\n    One, again, it crowds out and obfuscates who is speaking to \\\\nvoters. They cannot separate fact from fiction, they cannot \\\\nevaluate the message, because they do not know who is speaking \\\\nto them. It is unclear where their money is coming from.\\\\n    I also think it really increases a lot of cynicism in \\\\npolitics. People throw up their hands and they say, ``My voice \\\\ndoes not matter.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    You know whose voice does matter? It is the corporation, \\\\nthe wealthy special interests, that are dumping unlimited \\\\namounts of money into our politics and hiding behind fake front \\\\ngroups and fake names.\\\\n    People throw up their hands, and they sit out the next \\\\nelection, and they say, ``My voice does not matter.&#x27;&#x27; That is \\\\nun-American.\\\\n    Ms. Sewell. I would agree.\\\\n    I yield back the balance of my time.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy from North Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Everybody here, thank you all for coming.\\\\n    I will tell you, it is honestly embarrassing for the United \\\\nStates of America to have to be dealing with this. We are \\\\nsupposed to be the paragon of excellence with voting, and we \\\\nare supposed to go into other countries and make sure that they \\\\ndo it right, and we just cannot do it right in our own damn \\\\ncountry. It is embarrassing.\\\\n    I am saying this for Republican and Democrat. This has no \\\\nallegiance one side or the other. It is embarrassing.\\\\n    I appreciate what everybody is doing here as trying to keep \\\\nfree and fair elections. Every voice should be heard who wants \\\\nto be heard. There is also a thing called personal \\\\nresponsibility, getting up off your own derriere and making \\\\nsure that you could do something.\\\\n    Let me just play a quick round robin about--ask questions, \\\\nand we will go through.\\\\n    Should dead people be on voter rolls?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. No.\\\\n    Ms. Martin. Absolutely not.\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. No.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. No.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. All right. Good. No dead people. They are in \\\\nheaven. They do not need to vote.\\\\n    Voter ID. Is voter ID--is it repressing the vote?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. It is not.\\\\n    Ms. Martin. No.\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. No. The data is clear that it is not.\\\\n    Mr. Smith. I agree with Mr. Riemer.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. It depends on the ID. No one opposes ID. \\\\nWhat people oppose are the types of ID.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. Is voter ID--is voter ID suppressing the vote? \\\\nYes or no? Let us just--let us stop there.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. It depends on the ID. It is much more \\\\ncomplicated.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. If I pull out an ID--yes or no? You did this \\\\nagain. Is it yes or no? Is voter ID suppressing the vote?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. It depends on the ID. No one opposes voter \\\\nID. What people oppose are specific types of ID----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. All right. I am going to take that as you do \\\\nnot agree.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding [continuing]. that politicians are requiring \\\\npeople----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. All right. Listen.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding [continuing]. that many communities of \\\\ncolor----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. Mr. Spaulding, I am running this thing right \\\\nhere.\\\\n    Let me ask--well, let me, since you are talkative, let me \\\\nask you a question.\\\\n    You said half of the people sat out the 2020 election, \\\\ncorrect? Do you believe it is a person&#x27;s personal \\\\nresponsibility to vote?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Yes, I think it is everyone&#x27;s freedom and \\\\nresponsibility to make their voice heard.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. Right. Half the people voted, and so half the \\\\npeople said, ``I do not want to vote,&#x27;&#x27; and that is their \\\\npersonal responsibility. I agree with you that we should have \\\\neverybody vote, a hundred percent.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. I do \\\\nnot think that we know that 50 percent said, ``I do not want to \\\\nvote.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. Well----\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. That is where I might disagree.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. Yes, OK.\\\\n    Ballot harvesting, for example, do you agree with that?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Can you define ballot harvesting?\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. Going and having a kid walk through a \\\\nneighborhood and pull on houses. ``Here is your voter thing. I \\\\nwill help you fill it out, and I will hand it in.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. What if my grandmother was in----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. No, no. Yes or no? You just asked for my \\\\nexample.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. I am sorry. Could you please repeat the \\\\nhypo?\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. All right. A teenage kid that is paid to go and \\\\nknock on doors and say, ``Here is a ballot. I will help you \\\\nfill it out if you do not understand it and take it in and turn \\\\nit in.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. If the ballot is lawfully voted, I would not \\\\nhave a problem if a teenager--perhaps they----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding [continuing]. they are 18 and they work for \\\\nthe post office. I do not have a problem with someone----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. All right.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding [continuing]. taking a voted ballot from \\\\nsomebody who may be homebound and wants to make their----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. What if they went to a nursing home?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Sure, if you are in a nursing home, you have \\\\na right to make your voice heard.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. OK. You do not think there is anything that \\\\ncould go wrong with that where that voter could be influenced?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. What voter? By voting from--by voting from \\\\nhome?\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. No. Some person coming around and saying, \\\\n``Here, you vote this way,&#x27;&#x27; and they could not be influenced.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Well, there are laws against voter \\\\nintimidation. That is illegal.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. No, I am just saying, do you think there is \\\\nanything that could go wrong? It is ripe for fraud. It is ripe \\\\nfor fraud.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. That is just not--that just is not right. \\\\nThat is just not----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. It is ripe for fraud. I mean, my gosh, if \\\\nsomebody--the American public oftentimes does not have any clue \\\\nas to what is going on.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. I think we should----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. All right. Let me ask--Mr. Smith, I was just \\\\ninformed of this. I am not an attorney. I am just a dumb \\\\nsurgeon. I am just trying to figure this stuff out.\\\\n    In the American Confidence in Elections Act there is a \\\\nprovision to require unanimous consent of the FEC Commission \\\\nmembers in order to refuse to defend actions against the \\\\nCommission. In other words, they are trying to be sued. It is \\\\nmy understanding that the Commission was often deadlocked 3-3 \\\\nwhen voting on the FEC could even defend itself in cases.\\\\n    Based on your experience with campaign law and litigation, \\\\ncan you speak to and share your thoughts as to why this \\\\nprovision would be needed? Why would we prevent the FEC from \\\\ntrying to defend itself if it was being sued?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Sure. I would begin by noting that I do not \\\\nthink the FEC is often deadlocked. I think that is vastly \\\\noverstated. That is sort of a whole &#x27;nother issue. It does \\\\ndeadlock. You are right there. At times, there is a 3-3 vote.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. It deadlocks as to whether they could defend \\\\nthemselves?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. There is a 3-3 vote not to investigate or to \\\\nfind--not to find a reason to believe that a person has \\\\nviolated the law.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Smith. What has been happening on the Commission in \\\\nrecent years is, typically, after the Commission votes not to \\\\nproceed to enforcement or not to fine a party, if the vote \\\\ncomes 3-3 and you need a four-vote bipartisan majority to carry \\\\non, so if the Commission goes 3-3, the Commissioners who voted \\\\nnot to proceed are the controlling group. That has been \\\\nrecognized by the Court. Their decision controls the \\\\nCommission.\\\\n    What has happened in recent years is that Democrats on the \\\\nCommission have, in some cases, refused to vote to close the \\\\nfile, which is what is necessary in order to notify the \\\\nparties, ``Hey, we have exonerated you, or at least we are not \\\\ngoing to pursue this any further.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    The parties do not even know that the FEC is no longer \\\\npursuing a complaint against them.\\\\n    Then what happens is the private group--typically a \\\\npartisan group such as CREW or something like that--that has \\\\nbrought the complaint can then go into court and sue the FEC \\\\nfor not acting on the complaint, even though the FEC actually \\\\nhas----\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. All right. We are going to have to wrap up. We \\\\nare getting gonged by the chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Smith. We need--and what happens then is that the \\\\nDemocrats then refuse to allow the Commission to appear in \\\\ncourt to explain what it has done, thus trying to trigger a \\\\ndefault judgment.\\\\n    Dr. Murphy. All right. Thank you for your reply. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Mrs. Torres is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mrs. Torres. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding, since the 2020 election, the country has \\\\nseen a wave of restrictive voting laws, many of which, it has \\\\nnow been reported, were backed by billionaire-funded groups \\\\nthat were trying to suppress the votes of people whose opinions \\\\nthey disagree with. They are doing this behind closed doors and \\\\nwith clear political intentions.\\\\n    For example, Heritage Action, an arm of the Heritage \\\\nFoundation, is reportedly spending tens of millions of dollars \\\\npushing for restrictive voting laws.\\\\n    The ability of every eligible voter to cast the ballot is a \\\\nfundamental principle of democracy.\\\\n    January 6 was a really dark day in Americans&#x27; history. When \\\\nfolks in my community say how brave we were to go back and \\\\nfinish our job and certify the election that had been already \\\\ncertified by 50 States, I push back and I say the bravery did \\\\nnot come from the Members casting a vote to certify the \\\\nelection.\\\\n    The bravery comes and defending our democracy comes from \\\\nevery voter being able to cast their vote and having the \\\\ncourage to stand in line for 6 hours, to have the courage to \\\\npass by an armed member of their community who is standing \\\\nthere in an effort to stop them from voting.\\\\n    That is the bravery of and the decency of democracy that we \\\\nneed to uphold.\\\\n    What we do here is the easiest part of that. We do have a \\\\nresponsibility to ensure that the people who are funding \\\\ncampaigns disclose themselves so that the people that are \\\\npaying attention, whether it is to a mailer that comes in the \\\\nmailbox, a yard sign that has been posted, a TV commercial, \\\\nwhatever campaign paraphernalia is posted out there in the \\\\ncommunity, the voters have a right to know who paid for that. \\\\nThey have a right to know who paid for that because America has \\\\na dark past in preventing people who they do not agree with \\\\nfrom voting.\\\\n    The ability of every eligible voter to cast the ballot, \\\\nagain, is fundamental.\\\\n    Have we experienced a wave of election-related conspiracy \\\\ntheories and misinformation, Mr. Spaulding?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Absolutely. We have seen a wave of \\\\ndisinformation, misinformation that has deeply, deeply poisoned \\\\nour democracy.\\\\n    As you brought up January 6, when a former President, \\\\nrelying on a big lie, summoned people to Washington, incited an \\\\ninsurrection, turned them to march up here and ransack the \\\\npeople&#x27;s House in an attempt--we want to talk about cancel \\\\nculture--in an attempt to cancel the votes of more than 100 \\\\nmillion Americans?\\\\n    That was inspired by a big lie and disinformation that, to \\\\nthis day, including last evening, up until the second that I am \\\\nsitting here, continues to poison our democracy.\\\\n    Mrs. Torres. Yet we have yet to see justice on that case. I \\\\nmean, we have seen many gullible people go to prison and are \\\\ngoing to do some hard time for their responsibility and their \\\\nactions on that day--assaulting our police officers, using the \\\\nAmerican flag, their attempt to kidnap Members of Congress, \\\\ntheir attempt to hang Vice President Pence.\\\\n    Has that fed a backlash against an increased voter \\\\nparticipation when they see those images?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. It has. I think people throw up their hands.\\\\n    I do think that it has also led to determination. There are \\\\nhundreds of bills after 2020 that were introduced in \\\\nstatehouses across the country to make it harder to vote. At \\\\nthe same time, we are seeing people stand up and say, ``That is \\\\nnot how we want our democracy in this country. We are going to \\\\nexpand access to the ballot box. We are going to do whatever we \\\\ncan to lift up every voice in our democracy and make sure it is \\\\nheard.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mrs. Torres. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back.\\\\n    Ms. Lee of Florida is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Smith, I would like to return to your testimony and \\\\nsome of the questions that Dr. Murphy was covering with you.\\\\n    When that testimony left off, you were discussing the \\\\nsubject of the FEC failing to close files, even after a \\\\ndetermination not to pursue a complaint and after deciding not \\\\nto find a violation.\\\\n    Could you go back to that and elaborate on why that is \\\\nsignificant, why it matters?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Yes. Thank you, Congresswoman, for the \\\\nopportunity.\\\\n    As I was explaining, the FEC sometimes reaches a 3-3 vote \\\\nnot to investigate or not to find a party guilty of a \\\\nviolation. Again, it needs a bipartisan majority, and that is \\\\none of the protections that is built into the FEC. Other people \\\\nhave been trying to destroy that by creating a partisan \\\\nmajority, but that is another issue.\\\\n    The Commission votes 3-3 not to proceed, but then the \\\\nDemocratic Commissioners have refused to vote to close the \\\\nfile, meaning nobody is notified of their decision.\\\\n    Then, eventually, the group that brought the complaint has \\\\na statutory right to sue the FEC for inaction. The FEC has \\\\nacted, but nobody knows it.\\\\n    They sue, and then the Democratic Commissioners have voted \\\\nnot to allow the FEC to defend itself in court. It cannot go up \\\\nand defend the decision of the controlling Commissioners there.\\\\n    You get a default judgment against the Commission, which \\\\nessentially then enacts the theory of the law and the belief \\\\nand the facts that the complaining party has rather than having \\\\nthe Commission do it.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. Right there, I want to be sure we make this point \\\\nvery clear for everyone, including some who maybe have not \\\\nspent as much time in the courtrooms as others.\\\\n    Would you explain, please, what is a default judgment? If \\\\nthe FEC is sued, fails to show up, fails to respond to a \\\\ncomplaint, the court enters a default judgment. Would you \\\\nexplain, please, the significance of that and what it means?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Yes. I mean, a default judgment essentially is \\\\nthe court saying, ``Nobody showed up to defend, so we take the \\\\nallegations, basically, and the legal position of the plaintiff \\\\nas correct.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    What this does is it has the effect of farming out the \\\\ninterpretation of Federal election law to groups on the \\\\npolitical left that file complaints with the FEC and get the \\\\nthree Democratic Commissioners to go along and refuse to allow \\\\nthe FEC to even explain its reasoning and that it has, in fact, \\\\nacted. It is really a fraud on the court.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. In that circumstance, then, the FEC is not \\\\ndisputing, filing an answer to the complaint, or putting \\\\nanything into the court record that would contradict the \\\\nallegations in the plaintiff&#x27;s lawsuit, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Exactly. It does not show up.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. Now, is not there also a potential consequence \\\\nrelated to sanctions, attorney&#x27;s fees, or other things for the \\\\nfailure to respond in the case of an action being filed?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. There can be.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. Moving on to a different subject. Going back to \\\\nyour prior testimony, you touched on the subject of IRS \\\\nofficial Lois Lerner and the issues attendant with her.\\\\n    Will you talk a bit about the consent decree that the IRS \\\\nentered with the Tea Party groups?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Sure. Eventually, the IRS did enter a consent \\\\ndecree about 5 years after, 4 years after the scandal broke. In \\\\nit, the IRS admitted that its treatment of conservative \\\\norganizations during the tax-exempt determination process, \\\\nincluding screening their applications based on their names and \\\\npolicy positions, subjecting those applications to heightened \\\\nscrutiny and inordinate delays, and demanding of some \\\\nplaintiffs information that the U.S. Treasury Inspector General \\\\nfor Tax Administration had determined was unnecessary to the \\\\ndetermination of proper tax status, was nonetheless used to \\\\ndelay status here.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. As we sit here today all these years later, do you \\\\nfeel like we are still vulnerable to such action occurring \\\\nagain?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. We clearly are. As has been pointed out, the \\\\nCongress has blocked the IRS from moving forward in this \\\\ndirection, but it has been on an ad hoc basis, on a sort of a \\\\nyear-by-year device.\\\\n    Really what we need to do is get the IRS out of enforcing \\\\ncampaign finance law. The reason it got into this was precisely \\\\nbecause the bipartisan FEC was not engaging in enough \\\\npartisanship.\\\\n    The IRS is under control of the President. The President at \\\\nthe time made a number of statements about how these groups \\\\nwere destroying America and they were a threat to democracy and \\\\nall this kind of thing, and the IRS picked up the cue. It did \\\\nnot have a direct order, but they are not stupid. They picked \\\\nup the cue, ``Who will free me of these troublesome priests?&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nand they began harassing these conservative organizations. \\\\nThere is some evidence that it cost Republicans possibly as \\\\nmany as 5 to 8 million votes in the 2012 Presidential election.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. What action, if any, do you think Congress could \\\\ntake, or what legislation could be enacted, to prevent further \\\\nabuses of this nature?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. It gets a little bit complex. Again, basically, \\\\nit says that the FEC, the bipartisan FEC, which is supposed to \\\\ninterpret campaign finance law, will determine whether a group \\\\nis engaging in political activity under the law, and the IRS \\\\nmerely administers the tax side of things.\\\\n    Ms. Lee. All right. Thank you, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentlewoman yields back.\\\\n    Mr. D&#x27;Esposito is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. D&#x27;Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Good morning, everyone.\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon, over a year ago, the Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity established a Disinformation Governance Board charged \\\\nwith, quote, ``review questions of privacy and civil liberty \\\\nfor online content,&#x27;&#x27; close quote. This board, fortunately, was \\\\nshort-lived and dissolved in August 2022.\\\\n    I have a few questions based on the Governance Board.\\\\n    The first is, should the Federal Government be in the \\\\nbusiness of censoring political speech?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Absolutely not.\\\\n    Mr. D&#x27;Esposito. Second is--I am pretty sure I know the \\\\nanswer to it, but just to get it on the record--what about big \\\\ntech? Should they be in the business of censoring any political \\\\nspeech?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. I believe that, of course, corporations have \\\\ntheir own speech rights, but when you come to a consumer \\\\nplatform like this, I do believe that the law should be \\\\nexpanded to allow protections--a bill of rights, if you will--\\\\nfor users of social media because, today, they seem to be the \\\\nconsumers with the least rights in any industry in America.\\\\n    Mr. D&#x27;Esposito. I guess the final question is probably the \\\\none as to why we are actually here today.\\\\n    What do you believe--what impact do you believe censorship \\\\nhas of political speech in both the online, the platforms, as \\\\nwell as other censorship? What is its overall effect on general \\\\nelections?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Well, we can take the 2020 election as an \\\\nexample. The use of Government funds and Government coercion \\\\nhand-in-hand with regulated industries--that is the social \\\\nmedia companies--had a tremendous impact on citizens&#x27; ability--\\\\nthat their speech was not going to be punished by the \\\\nGovernment.\\\\n    We saw hundreds, perhaps thousands just in California alone \\\\nwho had their posts or their speech about the 2020 election--\\\\nwhich is, of course, core protected political speech--removed.\\\\n    This has caused many of those citizens to believe that \\\\ntheir voice no longer matters. It deters them from voting. It \\\\ncertainly deters them from speaking. It deters their friends \\\\nfrom speaking as well. This is un-American.\\\\n    I think that the First Amendment is the First Amendment for \\\\na reason. It is the fundamental premise on which we Americans \\\\nact. It is a beacon for the rest of the world as well. When in \\\\nAmerica our Government works hand in hand with corporations to \\\\nsuppress speech, I believe that violates the First Amendment.\\\\n    Courts have been reluctant to recognize that to date due to \\\\nan outdated Communications Decency Act, Section 230. That is \\\\nwithin the power of Congress to fix, and I urge you to do that.\\\\n    Beyond that, even citizens who do not speak on social media \\\\nare afraid that they will be punished at work, that they will \\\\nbe hounded by a mob, that they will suffer physical \\\\nconsequences for speaking.\\\\n    Censorship is antithetical to freedom. The antidote to \\\\nspeech that you do not like is more speech, and this is a \\\\nfundamental premise of the First Amendment.\\\\n    Mr. D&#x27;Esposito. Thank you. Thank you for your work. Thank \\\\nyou for being here today. I think the most important part of \\\\nyour answer was the fact that it is un-American. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Mr. Sarbanes is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity \\\\nto waive on the Committee.\\\\n    I wanted to talk a little bit about campaign financing----\\\\n    Chairman Steil. If the gentleman will yield just for a \\\\nminute for tech support? I just want to make sure that those \\\\nviewing online are able to hear you. Just give me--let us take \\\\n1 second here for tech support.\\\\n    Mr. Sarbanes. How about now?\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Much better.\\\\n    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity \\\\nto waive on the Committee.\\\\n    I wanted to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about \\\\nanother dimension of campaign finance. There was an allusion to \\\\nit earlier. This is the idea of empowering small donors so \\\\ntheir voices can be heard because, oftentimes, the average \\\\ncitizen out there feels like they cannot compete against deep-\\\\npocketed donors, against the super-PACs, and so forth. They \\\\nwant to be on the field of their democracy. They want to feel \\\\nlike they have some power within their own democracy.\\\\n    One of the proposals that was included in the Freedom to \\\\nVote Act was to establish a small donor matching system. If a \\\\nsmall donor gave $20, $50, there would be a corresponding \\\\nmatch, like a multiple match. It would come in, lift that up, \\\\nand allow them to feel like they are the ones that are \\\\nsupporting campaigns and, frankly, they are the ones to which \\\\nthe candidates and Members of Congress ought to be accountable.\\\\n    The evidence from this being implemented and tried across \\\\nthe country at the State level and the local level is, when you \\\\ndo that, people feel much more invested in their democracy. \\\\nThey feel like they are the ones that own the outcomes, not \\\\nsome shadowy, dark money figure that is hidden behind the \\\\ncurtain.\\\\n    It is a really important dimension.\\\\n    Having said that, I want to try and nip in the bud before \\\\nit gets distorted this notion that the fund that would provide \\\\nthese matching dollars will be a taxpayer fund. In fact, if you \\\\nlook at the language of the Freedom to Vote Act--and I think \\\\nthere was a reference to the bill earlier that maybe missed \\\\nthis--it explicitly says, with respect to the fund that would \\\\nprovide these matching dollars, quote, ``No taxpayer fund may \\\\nbe deposited into the fund.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    That same no taxpayer fund requirement actually applies to \\\\nthis entire State election assistance fund that would cover all \\\\nkinds of innovations that could happen at the State level.\\\\n    We were very intentional about making sure that taxpayers \\\\nwould not be on the hook. Well, the question is, ``Well, then, \\\\nwhere are you going to get the funds?&#x27;&#x27; We came up with an \\\\nelegant proposal on that, and that is to put a very tiny \\\\nsurcharge on settlements with high-end tax cheats and corporate \\\\nlawbreakers.\\\\n    Let me give you an example. In 2019, Facebook was ordered \\\\nto pay approximately $5 billion to the Federal Government \\\\nbecause they mishandled users&#x27; personal information. You take a \\\\ntiny little surcharge on that. You put it into the fund.\\\\n    In 2017, Volkswagen--remember this?--paid a $4.3 billion \\\\nfine to the Federal Government for cheating on diesel emission \\\\ntests. You take a tiny piece of that, you put it into the fund.\\\\n    This is how you would actually resource this ability of \\\\naverage citizens to get their voice amplified. I just wanted to \\\\nput that on the record because it seems that there is some \\\\nmisunderstanding about where the dollars come to support this \\\\nmatching effort. We were very explicit, we will continue to be, \\\\nthat not one dollar of taxpayer money will go toward that \\\\npurpose.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding, I do not have a lot of time. I got 30 \\\\nseconds. Speak to me quickly about why it is so important for \\\\nthe average person who wants their voice to be heard to know \\\\nthat big money is having to be accountable in terms of \\\\ndisclosure and transparency.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. People want to be heard. When they see that \\\\nso much of the money that is funding our elections is coming \\\\nfrom such a--as I mentioned in my statement--such a tiny, \\\\nunrepresentative segment of the population.\\\\n    You know, I was looking at--we have talked a lot about the \\\\npolitical parties and contribution limits. One person, one \\\\ndonor, could give to the political party committees in one \\\\nelection cycle up to $2 million, a $2 million check. Everyday \\\\nAmericans are saying, ``What about my voice? My voice has a \\\\nrole to play here, too.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Thank you very much. We appreciate you \\\\ncoming to House Administration, the most important Committee in \\\\nthe House, as you well know since you joined us today. I \\\\nappreciate your testimony. Yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Carey is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Carey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    I want to thank the witnesses for your testimony today.\\\\n    I do want to--I am going to talk a little bit about--Mr. \\\\nRiemer, I want to focus a little bit more on your role with the \\\\nRSC, your experience there.\\\\n    I kind of want to, if we could maybe--I do not think we \\\\nwere doing the same type of position back in 1976--but what was \\\\nthe impetus behind changing the amount, the donations back in \\\\n1976.\\\\n    Then, when McCain-Feingold was enacted, why was the limit \\\\nset to what it was? Was there ever any discussion at that time \\\\nto raise it with inflation?\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. That is a great question, Congressman. I am not \\\\nan expert on the legislative history of McCain-Feingold.\\\\n    What I do know is that, for some reason, the limits were \\\\nindexed for inflation for everybody but PACs and the State and \\\\nlocal parties. I think for PACs now, that is largely a \\\\nnonissue, because we have super-PACs, and I think PACs have \\\\nwaned in their influence.\\\\n    For State parties, I have not seen and I actually in \\\\nresearching for this hearing tried to find some rationale for \\\\nwhy they would exclude State parties. Maybe Professor Smith \\\\nknows. It very well could have been an oversight.\\\\n    I do think, overall, McCain-Feingold was trying to \\\\neliminate what was known as soft money, which was money flowing \\\\ninto the parties that was unregulated. Perhaps that was it. \\\\nThat does not make any sense because they were Federal limits, \\\\nand all that money is disclosed, and all the money that is \\\\nraised or spent is disclosed. I am honestly not sure.\\\\n    Mr. Carey. Well, let me ask you, Professor Smith. I mean, \\\\ndo you have any historical reference to that?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Just a touch more.\\\\n    The State party provisions in McCain-Feingold were \\\\nbasically kind of last-minute sorts of thing.\\\\n    There was a concern that, ``Oh, my gosh, we are putting all \\\\nthese new limits on the national parties and that sort of \\\\nthing. And, oh, now what will happen? Well, State parties can \\\\ninfluence elections for Federal office, so maybe we will try to \\\\ncontrol them as well.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I just do not think there was much thought given to it. \\\\nLike, on the indexing side, that was a last-minute compromise \\\\nthat worked primarily at that time just on donations to \\\\ncandidates&#x27; campaigns.\\\\n    It is just one of those things that was an afterthought, \\\\nbecause the goal of McCain-Feingold was to basically reduce the \\\\namount of political speech. They were not thinking about trying \\\\nto help State parties.\\\\n    Mr. Carey. To that, Mr. Riemer, I am going to just say it \\\\nagain.\\\\n    Why is it so important--I have my answer, but I am going to \\\\ndefer to you on this--why is it so important that we have, both \\\\non the Republican and the Democratic side, why is it so \\\\nimportant that we have strong State parties?\\\\n    Mr. Riemer. Absolutely. There are philosophical reasons, \\\\nand I think there is concrete reasons, I think. Let us go more \\\\npractical.\\\\n    One, they recruit, nominate, and elect our candidates. That \\\\ngoes down from school board or county council, let us say, all \\\\nthe way up to President. State parties have an integral role in \\\\nelecting delegates that go to the national convention, who \\\\nultimately select the next leader of our country.\\\\n    In many ways they are sort of the farm team as well. I am \\\\nsure lots of Members on this Committee came up through the \\\\nlocal party system. It is incredibly important.\\\\n    I think another thing is we are talking about all these \\\\noutside groups and super-PACs and everything else. 50 years \\\\nfrom now that super-PAC is probably not going to exist. 50 \\\\nyears from now that State party is going to exist. It is \\\\npermanent, it is always there, and it is not going away.\\\\n    Mr. Carey. Thank you, Mr. Riemer. I would agree with my \\\\ncolleague from Virginia that, while the party may still be \\\\nthere, some of our buildings may not be.\\\\n    Let me address you, Mr. Smith, on this.\\\\n    What are some changes you think could strengthen the State \\\\nand local parties? What are some changes to the laws that you \\\\nthink could strengthen both the State and the local parties?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Well, I appreciate you asking me. It might \\\\nactually be a better question for Mr. Riemer.\\\\n    I would say the biggest thing is that currently there is \\\\nthis provision called Levin funds, and local parties are \\\\nprohibited from engaging in communications that might have the \\\\nincidental effect of helping Federal candidates for office. It \\\\njust creates a colossal regulatory burden for State parties to \\\\nfigure out what they can do and to raise and spend money for \\\\ntheir own State and local races.\\\\n    If they spend money in their State and local races, but it \\\\nmight influence a Federal race--and it will because Federal \\\\ncandidates are on the ballot--they get subject to all these \\\\nregulations.\\\\n    Mr. Carey. Mr. Chairman, I want to, again, thank the \\\\nwitnesses, all of the witnesses, for your testimony today. It \\\\nwas very insightful.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for 5 minutes for the purpose of \\\\nasking questions.\\\\n    Ms. Perry Martin, do you know, when we pay--when the \\\\nFederal Government pays Social Security, does that come out of \\\\nthe U.S. Treasury?\\\\n    Ms. Martin. I do not believe so.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. If a check was cut to build a road or a \\\\nbridge in the United States or fund our military or pay for the \\\\nmen and women who are wearing the United States military \\\\nuniform, does that come from the United States Treasury?\\\\n    Ms. Martin. I actually do not know the answer to that.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. It does.\\\\n    Ms. Martin. OK.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. It comes from the United States Treasury.\\\\n    Under the Democrats&#x27; H.R. 1 from last Congress, where they \\\\nwould take Federal dollars and put it in politicians&#x27; \\\\nreelection campaigns, would that come from the U.S. Treasury?\\\\n    Ms. Martin. It would, yes.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. It would come from the U.S. Treasury. It \\\\nwould all come from the same pile.\\\\n    When we see the Democrats&#x27; bill from last Congress that \\\\nevery Democrat Member voted for that puts Federal dollars into \\\\npoliticians&#x27; reelection campaigns, it comes from the U.S. \\\\nTreasury, the same U.S. Treasury that pays Social Security. Is \\\\nthat accurate?\\\\n    Ms. Martin. Yes, it does.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. I think that is important to know.\\\\n    Let me shift gears to you, Harmeet Dhillon, if I can.\\\\n    When we traditionally think about free speech problems, we \\\\nthink about Government censorship. Today we see Government \\\\nworking hand in glove with private businesses to censor speech.\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon, based on your litigation experience, is it \\\\nunprecedented for the American Government to reach into private \\\\norganizations to censor Americans&#x27; speech?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Well, I do not know what happened in prior \\\\ndays, but I can say that the advent of social media has made \\\\nspeech a multibillion, even trillion-dollar corporate endeavor, \\\\nwhich is a good thing in a way. It has actually allowed many \\\\ncitizens whose voices never would have been heard by people in \\\\ndifferent States or around the world to speak. That is only \\\\ntrue if they are allowed to speak and be heard, if they are not \\\\nbeing censored by the heavy hand of the Government.\\\\n    Today the impact of Government cooperation with liberal \\\\norganizations and liberal executives at big tech companies in \\\\nSan Francisco has had a negative impact on speech in America.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Thank you.\\\\n    Let me shift gears slightly. In the 2020 election, we saw \\\\njurisdictions, including in my State of Wisconsin, municipal \\\\ngovernment jurisdictions, accept private funding for elections, \\\\ncommonly referred to as Zuckerbucks. Again in 2022, we saw a \\\\nsimilar pattern of private funding for elections, and in \\\\nparticular in the city of Milwaukee. Milwaukee Votes 2022 \\\\ncampaign, again, took private funding.\\\\n    Could you comment on how Zuckerbucks influenced the 2020 \\\\nelection?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Well, absolutely. You have seen, in addition \\\\nto the States you mentioned, Pennsylvania, Georgia \\\\nspecifically, CEIR used its funding to embed individuals in \\\\ncounty election operations----\\\\n    Chairman Steil. How did it impact the election?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Well, those employees turned out the vote more \\\\nin high-density urban areas; that is, Democrat jurisdictions. \\\\nThe impact was tens of thousands of votes in swing States that \\\\nwould otherwise not have been cast being cast on a partisan \\\\nfashion.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. So, in your opinion, it had a partisan \\\\nimpact on the election. Is that accurate?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Absolutely. In swing States.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Should nongovernment--in your professional \\\\nopinion, should nongovernment entities that provide funding for \\\\nelections be able to receive tax deductible contributions?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Absolutely not. Zuckerbucks should be banned, \\\\nand certainly these activities, if they were allowed, not be \\\\ntax deductible.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Ms. Perry Martin, do you think they should \\\\nalso not be tax-deductible donations?\\\\n    Ms. Martin. I do believe that, yes. I think a lot of States \\\\nhave--there are 25 States that have already passed this. State \\\\nlegislatures have recognized this problem.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Half the States have recognized this and \\\\nsuccessfully blocked it, half the States have not.\\\\n    Ms. Martin. Yes.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Including my State of Wisconsin has room \\\\nfor improvement here.\\\\n    Can you comment, Ms. Martin, about how we could improve our \\\\ncampaign finance system for parties and candidates to make it \\\\nmore transparent for voters?\\\\n    Ms. Martin. That is a very good question.\\\\n    Right now, there are so many provisions in our campaign \\\\nfinance laws that are overly complicated and honestly do not \\\\nmake a lot of sense. Modernizing and simplifying certain \\\\nprovisions of the law would make campaign finance laws more \\\\ntransparent for voters.\\\\n    For example, the limit on party-coordinated expenditures. \\\\nVoters know that parties exist to promote candidates and \\\\npolitical philosophies they espouse. It does not make any sense \\\\nto have this limited amount of money that they can spend.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I want to jump to you, if I can, Mr. Spaulding, with the \\\\nfinal minute that I have here.\\\\n    Are you employed by Common Cause?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Yes.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Do you know the tax status of your \\\\nemployer, Common Cause?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Well, we have a 501(c)(4) and a 501(c)(3).\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Are you employed by both the 501(c)(4) and \\\\nthe 501(c)(3)?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Actually--I am actually--well, I am employed \\\\nby the 501(c)(3), Common Cause Education Fund.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. You are employed by the 501(c)(3)----\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Correct.\\\\n    Chairman Steil [continuing]. not the 501(c)(4)?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Correct.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. OK. Under the DISCLOSE Act passed out of \\\\nthe House last Congress--strongly supported, I believe, by \\\\nPresident Biden--it would have required Common Cause to reveal \\\\nits top donors, contrary to privacy protection under current \\\\nlaw. Is that accurate?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Did you say the DISCLOSE Act?\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. No, it is not accurate.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. The DISCLOSE Act would not require the \\\\ndisclosure?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. The DISCLOSE Act would require organizations \\\\nthat spend $10,000 on certain campaign-related disbursements, \\\\nlike IEs, electioneering communications, other--we are a \\\\nnonpartisan organization. We do not support candidates.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Common Cause is not engaged in that \\\\nactivity?\\\\n    Mr. Spaulding. Neither Common Cause nor Common Cause \\\\nEducation Fund endorse candidates. We do not do campaign-\\\\nrelated work. We are a nonpartisan advocacy organization.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Very good. Thank you.\\\\n    Recognizing the time, I am going to yield back and \\\\nrecognize the gentleman who has joined our Committee, from the \\\\ngreat State of Louisiana, Mr. Johnson, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for inviting \\\\nme to participate. I would be so blessed to be on your \\\\nCommittee, but I serve on House Judiciary, on Armed Services, \\\\nand on the Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal \\\\nGovernment.\\\\n    Before I got to Congress, I spent 20 years in the courts \\\\ndefending free speech, religious freedom, and the like. This is \\\\nan issue that is near and dear to my heart. It is also near and \\\\ndear to the hearts of our constituents.\\\\n    When I am back home in my district holding town halls, \\\\nprobably the first or second question I get in every open forum \\\\nis, ``Can we trust our election system?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    This is no game. We all know that it is one of the most \\\\npressing issues that we have because America&#x27;s trust in our \\\\ninstitutions is wavering. It is at all-time lows. If we do not \\\\nhave this, you cannot maintain a constitutional Republic.\\\\n    Here is the problem that our constituents can see with \\\\ntheir own eyes. It has become common practice now for various \\\\ngroups and even Federal agencies to pursue retribution against \\\\nAmericans for simply exercising their First Amendment right to \\\\nparticipate in the political process.\\\\n    In the Weaponization Committee, we have uncovered alarming \\\\ninformation about, for example, the IRS targeting conservative \\\\ngroups. The name-and-shame tactics of the radical left. We know \\\\nthat none other than the FBI itself quite literally colluded \\\\nwith the social media platforms during the last two election \\\\ncycles to censor and silence viewpoints they disagreed with. \\\\nThis is un-American activity and it is deeply concerning.\\\\n    There is also a lot of confusion about the law. Let me just \\\\nask Mr. Smith first.\\\\n    For about a half-century, the Supreme Court has been \\\\ncrystal clear that spending money in the context of political \\\\nactivities qualifies as protected speech under the First \\\\nAmendment. Can you briefly describe just for the record today \\\\nwhy that is?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Sure. It is one of those things, if you ask the \\\\naverage person, ``Is money speech?&#x27;&#x27; of course they say no. The \\\\nSupreme Court does not say that money is speech. As you put it, \\\\nthey say that spending money affects speech.\\\\n    Let us imagine we said, well, The New York Times cannot \\\\nspend more than $3,300 a year to publish, which is the amount \\\\nan individual can give to a campaign. It would be a very small \\\\nnewspaper very, very quickly. To communicate with a large \\\\naudience you have to spend money.\\\\n    Or let us suppose that we said, well, you have freedom of \\\\nreligion, but you cannot spend any money to build a church or \\\\nbuy hymnals or pay a pastor. Clearly, that would impact the \\\\nFirst Amendment freedom of religion, and it is the same thing \\\\nwith speech.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Yes, because a candidate or an advocacy group \\\\nobviously cannot get their message out without spending money. \\\\nThis is the way it works. That is reality.\\\\n    Isn&#x27;t it true also that the Supreme Court has also said \\\\nthat the only constitutional basis for restricting money in \\\\npolitics is to prevent a quid pro corruption or the appearance \\\\nof that? Isn&#x27;t that right?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. That is correct. Sometimes people say that the \\\\nappearance of corruption is sort of just anything people think \\\\nis corrupt about the Government. They spend too much money, you \\\\nknow. It is not. By corruption, the court was very clear. It \\\\nmeant the appearance of, as you put it, quid pro quo \\\\ncorruption.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. I mean, we have had Justices on the right and \\\\nthe left acknowledge this and agree with it and embrace it.\\\\n    Every election cycle, we hear about the pernicious effects \\\\nof Citizens United. It is like a curse word now on the left. \\\\nDid not that decision simply reaffirm basic First Amendment law \\\\nthat corporations have a First Amendment right to speak on \\\\npolitical issues?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. I agree. It did.\\\\n    I also want to point out that on the disclosure side that \\\\ndealt only with express advocacy of the election or defeat of \\\\ncandidates. That was the issue there. That was not some broad \\\\nlicense to pass anything you want to call disclosure and say \\\\nyou can interfere with people&#x27;s privacy.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Here is an interesting footnote. Isn&#x27;t it true \\\\nthat during the Citizens United oral argument, the Obama \\\\nadministration actually argued before the Supreme Court that it \\\\nhad the authority to ban books, movies, and speech if it was \\\\nmade close to an election?\\\\n    Mr. Smith. Yes. Even one line.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Ms. Dhillon, I wish I had more time, but let \\\\nme ask you real quickly.\\\\n    Could you briefly describe some of the litigation that you \\\\nhave been involved in that relates to the Government telling \\\\nprivate businesses to censor viewpoints the Government sees as \\\\nwrong or dangerous?\\\\n    Ms. Dhillon. Well, one example--thank you for your \\\\nquestion--one example is the case of Rogan O&#x27;Handley, who was \\\\nbanned from social media for questioning the number of votes \\\\nthat President Biden received and even posting a photograph of \\\\nbarbed wire around the Capitol and highlighting the \\\\nirregularities--multiple irregularities--in the 2020 election. \\\\nHe is just one of hundreds that we know of in California, and \\\\nwe have since learned that there were thousands nationally.\\\\n    I think the most chilling thing to me was learning that the \\\\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, which comes from a Government \\\\nthat regulates these companies. A company is not free to simply \\\\nsay ``yes&#x27;&#x27; or ``no&#x27;&#x27; or take a meeting with the FBI when the \\\\nFBI asks you to do something.\\\\n    That chilling effect, I think, has really come--has been \\\\nhighlighted thanks to a change in control at Twitter. Without \\\\nthe change in control at Twitter we never would have learned \\\\nthe extent to which our Federal Government is threatening the \\\\nfreedom of American citizens to speak freely on our election.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. Exactly right.\\\\n    Unfortunately, I am out of time. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. Thank you very much. We appreciate you \\\\nbeing here, Mr. Johnson. I know sometimes Judiciary does not \\\\nhave the robust intellectual debates that we get to have in the \\\\nCommittee on House Administration. You are welcome to join us \\\\nanytime.\\\\n    Mr. Johnson. For the record, I did not say that.\\\\n    Chairman Steil. We appreciate you being here.\\\\n    I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, for 2 \\\\nminutes for closing remarks.\\\\n    Mr. Morelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you for all the witnesses for joining us this \\\\nmorning.\\\\n    The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that disclosure \\\\nrequirements are essential to safeguarding the ability of the \\\\ncitizenry to make informed choices. House Democrats will \\\\ncontinue to combat the rampant use of dark money with \\\\nlegislation like the Freedom to Vote Act, DISCLOSE Act, and \\\\nother measures to strengthen our campaign finance laws.\\\\n    I just, in my last moments, just want to ask for unanimous \\\\nconsent to enter into the record a report published by the \\\\nformer chair of this Committee, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, who \\\\nreviewed public social media posts by Members of the House who \\\\nwere sworn in January 2021 and who voted to overturn the 2020 \\\\nelection.\\\\n    These are posts on Twitter. I note that they were allowed \\\\nto post on Twitter, even though they were posting what \\\\nessentially were untruths. They are on Twitter. I just want to \\\\nmake that point.\\\\n    I also want to just note, Twitter is a private company. \\\\nThey are able to post whatever they choose to post. I am not \\\\naware that the Supreme Court has ever ruled that they are bound \\\\nto observe and post everyone or to validate anyone else who has \\\\nthe freedom to speak out.\\\\n    I also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the \\\\ndecision in ProtectMarriage.com v.

I would like to welcome everybody. And \\\\nbefore we get started, I want to recognize Congressman Stauber \\\\nfrom the great State of Minnesota to lead us in the pledge and \\\\nthe prayer.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Dear Lord, thank you for bringing us together \\\\nonce again in this Small Business Committee. We thank you for \\\\nthe Chairman and the Ranking Member and calling on both sides \\\\nof the aisle, and we ask that this be a productive meeting.\\\\n    We thank the witnesses for traveling here. We thank them \\\\nfor their safe trip here and ask that they return safely back \\\\nto their families.\\\\n    In your name, we pray. Amen.\\\\n    Please join me in the pledge.\\\\n    I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \\\\nAmerica, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, \\\\nunder God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Good morning, everyone. And I now call \\\\nthe Committee on Small Business to order.\\\\n    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a \\\\nrecess of the Committee at any time.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for my opening statement.\\\\n    Welcome to today&#x27;s hearing which will focus on how \\\\noverregulation in the healthcare industry limits small firms&#x27; \\\\ncompetitiveness and stifles innovation.\\\\n    I would like to start off by thanking our witnesses for \\\\njoining us here today. Thank you for being here. Your \\\\nattendance is greatly appreciated, and we value your input on \\\\nthese important issues.\\\\n    Now, we have consistently heard how overregulation is \\\\npreventing some of our best and brightest entrepreneurs from \\\\ninnovating and trying new things. We have heard this from many \\\\ndifferent industries, and today we will examine how these \\\\nefforts can still stifle innovation in the healthcare industry.\\\\n    The FDA is responsible for protecting the public&#x27;s health \\\\nby ensuring the safety and efficiency of the new pharmaceutical \\\\ndrugs, as well as medical devices. There is a lot of \\\\nresponsibility that goes along with this authority. For obvious \\\\nreasons, we want to make sure that the medicines people are \\\\ntaking are going to be fulfilling their intended purpose. \\\\nHowever, there is always a tradeoff in these decisions. And if \\\\nthe FDA shies away from any and all risk, it will significantly \\\\nlimit innovation and make it harder for small businesses to \\\\nmake an impact in the healthcare industry. The balance between \\\\nrisk and innovation is a fine line, and we must be able to \\\\nmaintain that.\\\\n    This Committee knows that small businesses are on the tip \\\\nof the spear across the economy when it comes to innovation in \\\\nany industry. The healthcare industry is not an exception. \\\\nDeveloping a new drug can take more than a decade and bring \\\\nwith it an extremely high price tag. Unfortunately, on top of \\\\nthe cost of development, small businesses have to spend \\\\nsignificant time navigating the FDA&#x27;s bureaucratic process. \\\\nThis presents a significant barrier to entry for main street. \\\\nSo navigating red tape does not only hamper what drugs come to \\\\nmarket but also how doctors are treating patients.\\\\n    In a hearing we held earlier this year, we heard from a \\\\ndoctor who was serving as a witness say they only spend 12 \\\\npercent of their day focusing on direct patient care. The other \\\\n88 percent is spent complying with government and private \\\\ninsurance requirements. Doctors want to treat, cure, and \\\\ninnovate, not spend time on bureaucratic red tape.\\\\n    This issue is very personal to me. My wife is currently \\\\nundergoing treatment for glioblastoma. Throughout this process, \\\\nI have heard countless stories from Americans looking for cures \\\\nand learned about many of the challenges in bringing new \\\\ntreatments to the marketplace.\\\\n    As a small business owner myself, I know the potential that \\\\nlies within Main Street America today, and we just need to make \\\\nsure they can operate in an environment that allows them to \\\\nflourish.\\\\n    I am looking forward to today&#x27;s discussion, and I hope the \\\\nhearing shines a light on the burdensome red tape currently \\\\nrestricting our small firms and providers.\\\\n    I ask unanimous consent to submit three op-eds from the SBE \\\\nCouncil for the record. And, without objection, I will order \\\\nthat.\\\\n    I would like to, once again, thank our witnesses again for \\\\nbeing here with us today, and I am very much looking forward to \\\\nour conversation.\\\\n    With that, I would like to yield to our distinguished \\\\nRanking Member from New York, Ms. Velazquez.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    I would like to thank all of the witnesses for being here \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    We all know that small businesses are the lifeblood of the \\\\neconomy, but that is especially the case in healthcare, where \\\\nsmall companies are at the forefront of technological \\\\ninnovation and are developing many groundbreaking new products. \\\\nAnd their influence is growing each year.\\\\n    According to one study, the proportion of new drugs \\\\ndiscovered by small startups more than doubled between 2009 and \\\\n2018, and by some accounts, now makes up as much as 80 percent \\\\nof the market. Yet despite their outside role in advancing \\\\ninnovation, small firms encounter significant barriers.\\\\n    The process of bringing a new drug or device to market can \\\\nbe costly and time-consuming because of the need to prove the \\\\nsafety and efficacy of the product. The FDA is responsible for \\\\nprotecting us all from potentially harmful substances or \\\\ndefective devices. For most, new drugs manufacturers often must \\\\nconduct animal testing before obtaining approval to conduct \\\\nclinical trials on humans, and those clinical trials can take \\\\nyears and cost millions of dollars.\\\\n    Some will say this process stifles innovation, but ensuring \\\\nmedical products prove their safety and clinical effectiveness \\\\nprior to going on the market is necessary for public trust, \\\\nindividual safety, and advancing genuine innovation.\\\\n    With that said, it is important we recognize FDA&#x27;s attempts \\\\nto balance scientific scrutiny with regulatory flexibility. \\\\nCongress and the FDA have long sought to expedite this process, \\\\nparticularly for rare disease treatments. Expedited programs of \\\\nthe FDA help bring potentially life-saving treatments to the \\\\nmarket much quicker, bringing hope to many patients and their \\\\nfamilies.\\\\n    Unfortunately, that does not come without potential for \\\\nabuse. Occasionally, drug companies use expedited programs to \\\\ncircumvent placebo-control studies, then drag their feet on \\\\nconducting the required follow-up studies. As a result, \\\\ncompanies are able to garner millions of dollars in sales \\\\nwithout proving clinical effectiveness. While I have full faith \\\\nin the FDA&#x27;s decision-making process, there must be safeguards \\\\nin place to prevent drug companies from taking advantage of \\\\nregulatory flexibility.\\\\n    Our regulatory system in healthcare is essential for \\\\nkeeping patients safe and delivering genuine innovation to the \\\\nmarket, but that cannot be done without strict scientific \\\\nstandards.\\\\n    I hope today we can discuss ways to support small \\\\nbusinesses and their role in saving lives with new innovation, \\\\nwhile also recognizing the need to prove those products are \\\\nsafe and effective for human use and consumption.\\\\n    I would like to thank all the witnesses again for being \\\\nhere, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back.\\\\n    And I will now introduce our witnesses.\\\\n    Our first witness here with us today is Dr. Brian Miller. \\\\nDr. Miller is an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns \\\\nHopkins University School of Medicine located in Baltimore, \\\\nMaryland.

NEWELL, J.D., CHIEF \\\\n    EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SUTRO BIOPHARMA, INC.; AND DR. DIANA \\\\n   ZUCKERMAN, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH\\\\n\\\\n                STATEMENT OF DR. BRIAN J. MILLER\\\\n\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. Thank you, Chairman Williams, and Ranking \\\\nMember Velazquez, and distinguished Members of the Committee.\\\\n    I am a practicing physician at Hopkins, an internist, a \\\\nnonresident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. I run \\\\na large policy research group, and I actually worked at the \\\\nFDA. I was a reviewer in the Center for Drug Evaluation in the \\\\nOffice of New Drugs. I also serve on the Medicare Payment \\\\nAdvisory Commission, and I previously served 4 years on CMS&#x27; \\\\nMedicare Evidence Development &amp; Coverage Advisory Committee.\\\\n    Today I am here in my personal capacity. My views are my \\\\nown and not those of Hopkins, the American Enterprise \\\\nInstitute, or MedPAC. Disclosures aside, I want to start and \\\\ntalk about innovation.\\\\n    So my grandmother was this tiny, little, part-Norwegian \\\\nlady who would bake for us every year at Thanksgiving. And she \\\\nloved to garden. And I remember as a kid, for a couple years \\\\nshe couldn&#x27;t bake pie for us--and I love food. It is a problem. \\\\nI love carbs. I remember her hands being red and swollen.\\\\n    Then I remember one year she baked a pie again, and I \\\\nremember that year because that was the year the first TNF \\\\nalpha inhibitor was introduced, and her rheumatoid arthritis \\\\nwas able to be treated. So she could bake again, garden, and go \\\\nabout her life.\\\\n    So innovation, for me, when I think about it in my head, \\\\nthe first thing I remember is eating apple pie as a child. So \\\\ninnovation is not really just a number; it is your life.\\\\n    A bipartisan Congress has worked for 30 years on \\\\npharmaceutical product, innovation, and promoting safe medical \\\\nproducts. I saw the direct impact of these tools when I worked \\\\nat the FDA, tools like accelerated approval, which is an \\\\nobjective science-based mechanism for early market entry for \\\\ndrugs meeting an unmet need based upon a surrogate end point. \\\\nThere has been a lot of critique of these sorts of tools \\\\nrecently.\\\\n    We should remember where they came from. In the eighties we \\\\nhad the AIDS crisis, and activists from ACT UP actually \\\\noccupied the FDA for a day in 1988 and made the news. They \\\\ndidn&#x27;t have access to treatments, the FDA was a barrier, and \\\\nproducts were available in other countries. And this started a \\\\n30-year cycle of FDA reform.\\\\n    If we actually read the studies from the critics of these \\\\npathways, it says that many of these studies get done. They \\\\nsometimes get done slowly. When I look at this and say, if \\\\nthese trials are done late, yes, maybe the company should--\\\\nthere are other things that the company can or should do, but \\\\nit also tells me that we need to change how we do clinical \\\\ntrials.\\\\n    And, for me, as I said, it is not just my grandmother, it \\\\nis personal. My father died of glioblastoma 2 weeks before I \\\\nmoved to Chicago and started medical school, and he was 58. For \\\\nme, innovation is about people and their lives and their \\\\nfunctional status.\\\\n    I think about clinical trials--we are stuck in the \\\\nseventies. The FDA has promoted concepts as real-world \\\\nevidence, patient-report outcomes, but we have to make it real. \\\\nMaking it real could mean for something like COPD, you do a 6-\\\\nminute walk test at home, you assess spirometry for lung \\\\nfunction at home. You do for Parkinson&#x27;s, say, a video \\\\ninterview to assess their ability to move.\\\\n    All these outcomes are patient-focused, and they are and \\\\ncan be done in the setting of the patient&#x27;s home. We are not \\\\nnecessarily forcing the patient to drive to a study center. \\\\nThey also decrease the cost of trials, which allows for small \\\\ncompanies to develop innovative products, and they also \\\\nincrease the diversity of the patients who participate in \\\\nclinical trials.\\\\n    How do we do this? Well, you need the FDA reviewer to be \\\\nthe counselor to the company, because the reviewer is sitting \\\\non top of an entire therapeutic area at the FDA. The problem is \\\\nthat there is too much management, too many administrative \\\\nlayers at the FDA. If you are a reviewer, you have your--you \\\\nare doing the work, then you have a team leader, you have a \\\\ndeputy division director, a division director, then you might \\\\nhave an office director, and then you might have a super office \\\\ndirector, all of whom are highly trained technical physicians \\\\nand scientists reviewing the work that you already did.\\\\n    So I think that we need to collapse some of those layers of \\\\nadministration, put those people back on the front line of \\\\nreviewing medical products for efficacy and safety so that they \\\\ncan be a better counselor to industry, and particularly small \\\\nbusiness and entrepreneurs.\\\\n    Other things that we can and should do include returning \\\\nthe staff to the office so that if you are a small company, you \\\\nare not just facing a sea of black on Zoom.\\\\n    In conclusion, I think there are a lot of things that we \\\\ncan do that are pragmatic and that are bipartisan to help lower \\\\nbarriers to entry for small companies and entrepreneurs to \\\\nsafely--to create safe and effective, innovative products to \\\\ntreat disease and help everyday Americans.\\\\n    And I thank you.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.\\\\n    And I now recognize Dr. Eagle for his 5-minute opening \\\\nremarks.\\\\n\\\\n              STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID ANTHONY EAGLE\\\\n\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Chairman Williams, Ranking Member Velazquez, and \\\\nMembers of the House Committee on Small Business, thank you for \\\\nthe opportunity to participate as a witness in this critically \\\\nimportant hearing on regulatory and related burdens in small \\\\nbusinesses in healthcare.\\\\n    I am a practicing medical oncologist with New York Cancer &amp; \\\\nBlood Specialists, and serve as Chair of legislative affairs \\\\nand patient advocacy. I am a board member and past president of \\\\nthe Community Oncology Alliance, a nonprofit group advocating \\\\nfor independent nonhospital-owned community cancer care.\\\\n    My career began in a small practice, three-physician \\\\nindependent community oncology practice, in Mooresville, North \\\\nCarolina. I have been privileged to care for patients in an era \\\\nof immense scientific progress in overcoming a disease as it \\\\nthreatens to take our closest loved ones from us.\\\\n    My physician partners and I work closely with our nurses, \\\\nnurse practitioners, medical assistants, and ancillary staff, \\\\ncaring for patients battling cancer and blood disorders. We \\\\nwere a family.\\\\n    We live with our patients on the front lines of an \\\\nincreasingly broken medical system. We often acted as their \\\\nlast line of defense, not only for their medical illnesses, but \\\\nalso for the confusing and overwhelming medical system in which \\\\nthey and we, as their providers, increasingly were fighting.\\\\n    Barriers to care, both large and small, sometimes \\\\nincidental, other times intentional, popped up all over the \\\\nplace and were almost always far too much to bear for patients \\\\nfacing the battle for their lives.\\\\n    Over time, our small practice, operating as a small \\\\nbusiness, encountered significant pressures from large, well-\\\\nfunded hospital oligopolies in the Charlotte area and beyond in \\\\nNorth Carolina. In 2017, one large health system in our region \\\\ngave us an ultimatum: Be acquired by us or we will hire \\\\nphysicians to compete against you.\\\\n    One of the prime motivators for this aggressive move by the \\\\nhealth systems was the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. The \\\\nacquisition of our practice would generate substantial \\\\nimmediate profits for the health system, allowing it to further \\\\nexpand. Furthermore, we were faced with declining payments from \\\\nMedicare and commercial insurers.\\\\n    In 2018, my two partners and I had little choice but to \\\\njoin the large hospital systems of employees. Our small \\\\nindependent practice that had served the community for over 19 \\\\nyears was gone.\\\\n    Hospital clinics operate under stifling bureaucracies, and \\\\nas a result, almost immediately I was unable to see the same \\\\nnumber of patients that I was able to see daily in my own \\\\nindependent practice. As devastating, the hospital later \\\\nswitched over its billing system and was able to charge \\\\nsignificantly more for the same services. Patients came to the \\\\nsame building, were treated by me, their same physician, and \\\\nreceived the same drugs but at a higher cost to them. Patients \\\\nwho I treated and followed for years simply left.\\\\n    Due to consolidation of hospitals into large health systems \\\\nin North Carolina, I joined my current practice in New York. \\\\nUnlike the large health systems, we are the only major cancer \\\\nprovider in our region that accepts all insurance plans, while \\\\nalso being the only major cancer treatment provider that does \\\\nnot receive State funding or other subsidies. We have open \\\\nclinics in underserved communities, are the lowest cost cancer \\\\nproviders in all of our markets, and were recently named the \\\\nnumber one physician practice in New York by Castle Connolly, a \\\\nrating system based on physician peer reviews.\\\\n    Cancer research, drug development, and care delivery are in \\\\na renaissance. I am privileged to practice in an era of \\\\nbreakthrough scientific progress. However, patients often do \\\\nnot get the treatment that they need or in the best manner \\\\npossible.\\\\n    We face a fundamental choice in this country. Who is in \\\\ncharge of patient medical care? Is it physicians and patients \\\\nmaking decisions on treatments together in the exam room? Or is \\\\nit insurance companies, massive, consolidated health systems, \\\\nand government regulators like CMS, controlling personal \\\\nhealthcare decisions from afar? Over my career, the shift has \\\\nabsolutely been toward the latter.\\\\n    In my written testimony, I touch upon some of the other \\\\nsignificant forces pressuring medical practices, including \\\\nutilization management by consolidated insurers and pharmacy \\\\nbenefit managers, misguided CMS regulations, and Medicare \\\\npayment cuts that are forcing independent physicians out of \\\\nbusiness.\\\\n    These factors, combined with the mounting pressures from \\\\nmega health systems, are resulting in cancer patients losing \\\\naccess to care, not getting the best treatment, and paying more \\\\nfor their healthcare.\\\\n    I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. I now recognize Mr. Newell for his 5-\\\\nminute opening remarks.\\\\n\\\\n               STATEMENT OF MR. WILLIAM J. NEWELL\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. Chairman Williams, Ranking Member Velazquez, \\\\nthank you for the opportunity to appear before this Committee \\\\nto discuss the drug development ecosystem and the challenges \\\\nsmall biotechnology companies face.\\\\n    My name is Bill Newell, and I am the CEO of Sutro \\\\nBiopharma, Inc. I have been at Sutro since January 2009, and \\\\nworking in small company biotech since 1998. I also serve on \\\\nthe board of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization and \\\\nChair BIO&#x27;s capital formation work group.\\\\n    Sutro Biopharma focuses on research and development and \\\\nmanufacturing for next-generation cancer medicines; primarily, \\\\nantibody drug conjugates commonly referred to as ADCs. Our \\\\ncompany is 21 years old, and we are still a pre-commercial \\\\ncompany, meaning we have yet to secure FDA approval for a \\\\nmedicine we have developed.\\\\n    I was employee number 19, and today we have over 300 \\\\nemployees and a market cap of approximately $300 million. Like \\\\nmany U.S.-based biotechs, Sutro has seen substantial domestic \\\\njob creation with about 40 percent of our workforce in or \\\\nsupporting our U.S.-based manufacturing facility. This is the \\\\nworld&#x27;s only manufacturing facility utilizing cell-free protein \\\\nsynthesis technology at scale.\\\\n    I am pleased to say that we recently began two pivotal \\\\nphase 3 trials for our most advanced medicine. This is an ADC \\\\nfor patients with late-stage ovarian cancer and for patients \\\\nwith an ultra-rare pediatric leukemia, but readouts are not \\\\nexpected for a few more years. We have multiple additional \\\\npotential cancer medicines and research in early clinical \\\\ndevelopment.\\\\n    In many ways, Sutro&#x27;s corporate journey is a microcosm of \\\\nthe small biotech financing experience. We have raised \\\\napproximately $190 million in venture capital. We went public \\\\nin 2018, benefiting from the JOBS Act of 2012. So far, we have \\\\nraised approximately $535 million in public market offerings.\\\\n    In addition, collaborations with larger biopharma companies \\\\nhave been essential to advancing our research and development. \\\\nWe have received approximately $720 million in funding and \\\\nreimbursements for R&amp;D collaborations and our licensing product \\\\ncandidates. This funding comes primarily from large and mid-\\\\nsized biopharma companies.\\\\n    In addition, at various points in time we have borrowed \\\\nfrom venture lenders. I am proud to say that we are debt-free \\\\nas of earlier this year.\\\\n    All told, Sutro has raised almost $1.6 billion in the \\\\ncompany&#x27;s history, and we are still several years away from our \\\\nfirst approved medicine. That eyebrow-raising figure is, \\\\nunfortunately, very typical of the small biotech experience in \\\\nbringing a product to market.\\\\n    Also, like many biotechs, we have had our share of failures \\\\nalong the way. This is not unusual for our industry. Only \\\\napproximately 12 percent of products reaching clinical \\\\ndevelopment stage are ever approved, and just half of products \\\\nreaching phase 3, pivotal trial stage, ever get FDA approval.\\\\n    In my remaining time, I want to emphasize the need to \\\\nreauthorize the pediatric priority review voucher program. The \\\\ncurrent program expires September 30 of this year, and Sutro \\\\nand our industry partners strongly support the Creating Hope \\\\nReauthorization Act of 2024. This bipartisan bill provides \\\\ncritical incentives to promote research and development for \\\\ndrugs to treat rare diseases impacting children across the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    As I mentioned, Sutro is pursuing a phase 3 trial for an \\\\nultra-rare pediatric leukemia which affects approximately 50 \\\\ninfants and toddlers a year. The sad reality is that the \\\\neconomics of pursuing our medicine in this indication would \\\\nclearly dictate that we should not do so. The key economic \\\\nrationale for us to pursue this ultra-rare indication is the \\\\nvalue to Sutro of a pediatric priority review voucher. It is \\\\ncases like this one that make it imperative that this program \\\\nbe reauthorized.\\\\n    Lastly, I want to thank the Members of this Committee who \\\\neither co-sponsored or voted for the American Innovation and \\\\nR&amp;D Competitiveness Act of 2023, H.R. 2673, which was \\\\noverwhelmingly approved on a bipartisan basis by the House \\\\nearlier this year.\\\\n    However, because H.R. 2673 has not yet been enacted into \\\\nlaw, we paid $15 million in federal taxes this year as a result \\\\nof the switch to a 5-year amortization schedule, even though we \\\\nhave never sold a single vial of medicine. This tax liability \\\\nmeans two phase 1 clinical trials for our cancer medicines no \\\\nlonger have funding.\\\\n    I have included additional policies in my written testimony \\\\nthat highlight other actions Congress can take to support small \\\\nbiotech companies. As the innovation driver of the \\\\nbiopharmaceutical ecosystem and industry that keeps America at \\\\nthe cutting-edge, it is important to create a policy landscape \\\\nthat supports companies like Sutro.\\\\n    I am honored to be here discussing both the challenges \\\\nassociated with running a small biotech company and the true \\\\nhonor it is to dedicate each and every day to the service of \\\\npatients and their loved ones.\\\\n    Thank you for allowing me to testify today. I look forward \\\\nto answering your questions.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you very much.\\\\n    And I now recognize Dr. Zuckerman for her 5-minute opening \\\\nremarks.\\\\n\\\\n                STATEMENT OF DR. DIANA ZUCKERMAN\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. ZUCKERMAN. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Williams, Ranking Member Velazquez, and \\\\ndistinguished Members of the Committee, I am Dr. Diana \\\\nZuckerman, president of the National Center for Health \\\\nResearch, a public health think tank here in Washington.\\\\n    I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to share the \\\\nviews of the Center, which does not accept funding from any \\\\ncompanies with a financial interest in our work. Our goal is to \\\\nuse research information to inform and improve policies and \\\\nprograms for the healthcare of everyone in this country.\\\\n    As a scientist and a policy expert and a cancer survivor, I \\\\nlook for common ground. I respect the important work of all the \\\\nother panel members and this important Committee. And I think \\\\nwe can all agree that we want small businesses to succeed and \\\\nto provide the best possible products.\\\\n    In medicine, let&#x27;s agree that we want innovation that is \\\\ndefined as better products and better treatments that have \\\\nmeaningful benefits for patients: Living longer, spending less \\\\ntime in the hospital, and having a better quality of life.\\\\n    The FDA makes it very clear that it does not expect or \\\\nrequire absolute certainty when it approves a drug or medical \\\\ndevice, and I will give two examples of their flexibility.\\\\n    A few weeks ago, a company named Amylyx reported that its \\\\none and only drug, Relyvrio, did not work. FDA had granted \\\\napproval to the drug to treat ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s \\\\ndisease, even though the company ignored FDA&#x27;s advice to \\\\ncomplete their clinical trial before they asked for approval.\\\\n    FDA scientists and advisory committee members warned that \\\\nthe evidence was weak and that the drug might not work at all, \\\\nbut FDA approved it anyway because ALS is a terrible disease, \\\\nand the agency wanted to be flexible, and patients hoped that \\\\nthe product would work.\\\\n    The drug cost $158,000 per patient per year, even though it \\\\nwas a combination of two much less expensive ingredients, one \\\\nof which is a dietary supplement sold on Amazon for a few \\\\ndollars.\\\\n    The company promised to continue studying the drug, \\\\ncomparing it to placebo, and eventually they reported that \\\\npatients taking the drug were no better off than patients on \\\\nplacebo. Meanwhile, last year, the company had $380 million in \\\\nrevenues, and the two young men who co-founded the company paid \\\\nthemselves $7.4 million each just last year.\\\\n    When Relyvrio was taken off the market, the stock dropped \\\\n80 percent, and 70 percent of the staff were left--let go.\\\\n    Another example is Sarepta, a company that submitted its \\\\nonly product for FDA approval based on data for only 12 \\\\npatients and no placebo group. I have never seen any study like \\\\nthat get approval. But despite that lack of evidence, Exondys \\\\n51 for Duchenne muscular dystrophy was approved. And they \\\\ngranted accelerated approval in 2016 because, as a small \\\\nbusiness, Sarepta did not have the capital to continue to do \\\\ntheir clinical trials unless they were able to sell their \\\\nproduct and make some money.\\\\n    The company promised a larger study would be completed in \\\\n2020, but here we are, 2024, and it still hasn&#x27;t happened, and \\\\nwe are still waiting for any credible evidence from the company \\\\nto show that it works after 8 years.\\\\n    The price of the drug has increased from about $400,000 per \\\\npatient per year to over a million dollars per year per \\\\npatient, and families have gone broke even paying the co pays, \\\\nand Medicaid has, as a result of that, footed most of the bill.\\\\n    So these examples are two that show that FDA is sometimes \\\\nvery helpful to small businesses, sometimes ignoring the \\\\nagency&#x27;s own requirements to give companies a chance to \\\\nsucceed. And there is research showing that many large \\\\ncompanies also benefit from this flexibility. And in my written \\\\ntestimony, I have provided examples of the research evidence \\\\nand the lower user fees that FDA charges for small businesses \\\\nand how Congress has passed user fee legislation that helps to \\\\nlevel the playing field for small companies.\\\\n    The bottom line is that we all want medical products to be \\\\nsafe and effective. Small businesses will have the resources to \\\\nmeet the FDA&#x27;s evidence standards for many types of medical \\\\nproducts, but not all.\\\\n    What&#x27;s the alternative? If the FDA reduces the burden on \\\\ncompanies by not requiring them to provide clear evidence that \\\\na new product is safe and effective, that increases the burden \\\\non patients, families, and physicians, because we must make \\\\nlife-saving and life-changing decisions without the facts that \\\\nwe need to make the decisions that are best for us and our \\\\npatients.\\\\n    Thank you very much.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. We will now move to the Member \\\\nquestions. Under the 5-minute rule, I recognize myself for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Healthcare is something that is extremely personal to every \\\\nAmerican. We need to make sure that patients can get the care \\\\nthey need by the providers they want at a price they can \\\\nafford. Unfortunately, I have heard stories, as we have heard \\\\ntoday, from people that are not able to abide by these three \\\\nprinciples for many different reasons, one of which is a \\\\ncomplicated, expensive process to get new drugs on the market.\\\\n    I understand these challenges firsthand, after my family \\\\nsearched for the best treatment options for my wife, Patty, \\\\nafter she was diagnosed with glioblastoma in December of 2022. \\\\nAs we learned about the various possibilities and tried to \\\\nselect the best path forward, we were shocked to hear that \\\\ncertain options were only available abroad because they had not \\\\nbeen approved in the U.S. yet.\\\\n    I understand the need to ensure we have safe medicines and \\\\ntreatments coming to the market, but it made me think what \\\\nhurdles might be in place that are slowing this down and what \\\\nthe effect on patient outcomes may be.\\\\n    So, Dr. Miller, you worked at the FDA and are currently \\\\npracticing medicine at Johns Hopkins University and probably \\\\nhave some great insights on the variety of challenges that \\\\ncause cases like my wife&#x27;s to be a reality for so many \\\\nAmericans.\\\\n    So my question is, can you elaborate on some reasonable \\\\nchanges that can be made to streamline the approval process so \\\\nwe can bring more treatments to the marketplace without \\\\nsacrificing patient safety?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. Thank you. And I am very sorry to hear about \\\\nyour wife.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. She is doing good.\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. That is good to hear.\\\\n    I think the clinical trial reform is the thing that PDUFA \\\\nhas promised for 30 years and, frankly, hasn&#x27;t delivered on. \\\\nGetting the reviewer to actually guide small companies and \\\\nentrepreneurs who are scrappy and want to do things differently \\\\nis the first step that I would do. And doing that would mean \\\\ncollapsing layers of management and making sure that the \\\\nprimary task of the FDA is focusing on review of products to \\\\nmake sure that they are safe and effective, because the FDA--\\\\nCDER, for example, has 5,800 employees. Most of them are not \\\\nfocused primarily on that task.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Now, with the passage of the Democrat-\\\\nled Inflation Reduction Act, the University of Chicago \\\\nestimates that its provisions will result in 135 fewer drugs \\\\nbeing brought to the market. Along with these provisions, \\\\nPresident Biden called on to expand these price controls to \\\\ninclude 500 drugs, as opposed to the IRA&#x27;s 50.\\\\n    The American Dream is built on risk and reward. If there is \\\\nnot going to be a profit incentive to bring new drugs to the \\\\nmarketplace, fewer businesses will dedicate the necessary \\\\nresearch and development dollars to make them a reality.\\\\n    So, Mr. Newell, as a small pharmaceutical company, how do \\\\nthe IRA&#x27;s price controls impact your business and deter \\\\ninnovation?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. Thank you, Chairman Williams.\\\\n    As you would have heard from my testimony, we have raised a \\\\nsubstantial amount of capital through the years to bring our \\\\nmedicines forward and to build our business. We work in the \\\\nbiologics field, and I have other colleagues who work on small \\\\nmolecule medicines. In particular, those are things that are \\\\npills that are given to--for patients.\\\\n    Particularly in the IRA, we see that there are substantial \\\\ndisincentives for investors to invest in companies that make \\\\nsmall molecule medicines because of the different terms allowed \\\\nfor the introduction of the price negotiations that are \\\\nmandated by the IRA. For biologics companies like Sutro, we \\\\nhave a 13-year window, but a small molecule manufacturer \\\\ninnovator has a 9-year window. That is a disincentive to \\\\ninvestors.\\\\n    Given the tremendous amount of money that it takes to bring \\\\na drug forward to prove its safety and efficacy, we should be \\\\nnot disincentivizing people who make small molecule medicines \\\\nfor patients.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. All right. Thank you.\\\\n    And, Dr. Eagle, in your testimony, you emphasize that \\\\nhealthcare consolidation is on the rise and small practices \\\\nlike yours are struggling to keep up.\\\\n    So in the brief time that we have left, can you please \\\\ndescribe to the Committee how consolidation harms patient care, \\\\nand beyond just patient care, what are the downsides of the \\\\nconsolidation in the healthcare system?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. I think a large consolidated system is, first, \\\\nthey are more expensive. You know, they tend to be hospital \\\\nsystems that charge facility fees. You know, they can provide \\\\nexcellent care, but I think it oftentimes is less convenient \\\\nfor patients.\\\\n    I think small physician offices, you know, get to know the \\\\ncommunity better, you know, have better processes, and provide \\\\nlower cost care for patients and more affordable and more \\\\nconvenient format.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    And I now recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes of \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Dr. Zuckerman, the FDA has strict standards for approving \\\\nnew drugs and devices to prove their effectiveness. Is there \\\\nany evidence that you are aware of that FDA&#x27;s high standards \\\\nhave driven innovation and investment to other countries?\\\\n    Ms. ZUCKERMAN. Thank you for that question. I haven&#x27;t seen \\\\nthat evidence. You have to remember that the standards are very \\\\nsimilar in other countries, and there aren&#x27;t very many drugs or \\\\ndevices that are available in other countries but not here. And \\\\nwe pay a lot more for them. So there is a lot of incentive to--\\\\nto get FDA approval.\\\\n    It used to be that FDA was a lot slower than other \\\\ncountries. That is absolutely true. But it is not true anymore, \\\\nand it is partly because Congress passed the user fee \\\\nlegislation, which really has sped up the approval to the point \\\\nthat it is very, very similar in other countries.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.\\\\n    Two years ago, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, \\\\nwhich allowed Medicare to cap the price of insulin and \\\\nnegotiate prices for certain drugs. Has this had a measurable \\\\neffect on research and development spending by pharmaceutical \\\\ncompanies?\\\\n    Ms. ZUCKERMAN. R&amp;D is very important, and it is related to \\\\nhow much money the companies have. But R&amp;D is really only a \\\\nsmall percentage compared to stock prices and things like that. \\\\nSo there really isn&#x27;t any evidence that, although this could \\\\nhave an effect on which drugs companies invest in but not--it \\\\nshouldn&#x27;t have a chilling effect on innovative drugs.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, you mentioned that utilization management \\\\npresented barriers to care for doctors and their patients. Do \\\\nyou think the increased use of these practices is a function of \\\\nthe market power of insurance companies?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman \\\\nVelazquez.\\\\n    Absolutely. You know, we have seen tremendous consolidation \\\\namong the pharmacy benefit managers, among the insurers. One of \\\\nthe tools they use is utilization management that comes in \\\\ndifferent forms. One is prior authorization, where, you know, \\\\nthe--after the physician and the patient have decided what they \\\\nwould like to do, we seek approval from the insurance company. \\\\nOften it is declined, and the next step is a step called \\\\nclinical peer review, where we have to get on the phone with \\\\nthe insurance company physician.\\\\n    You know, in cancer medicine, we do very careful \\\\ndecisionmaking. You know, we look at the literature, we present \\\\nwith colleagues, we discuss cases at tumor boards. It is very \\\\nfrustrating when you then have to turn around and speak with an \\\\ninsurance company to a physician who may not be an oncologist. \\\\nFortunately, New York recently passed a law that requires \\\\npeople at least to be in the same specialty as the case they \\\\nare reviewing. That is a fairly low standard.\\\\n    My first question is always: Have you read the notes? And \\\\nthen we generally start the conversation from there. It is very \\\\ncommon for, you know, PET scans, therapies to be denied.\\\\n    Another part of utilization management is fail-first \\\\ntherapy, where the insurance company will demand that we use \\\\nparticular therapies before others. I just had a patient \\\\nyesterday who started treatment for breast cancer where the \\\\nnausea medicine that I wanted to use was not approved by the \\\\ninsurance company. They required that we substitute an \\\\nalternative nausea medication. That can be a problem.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Zuckerman, we hear that the FDA often requires absolute \\\\ncertainty when making decisions about approving new products. \\\\nCan you discuss the standard required by the FDA and the \\\\nimpacts on innovation?\\\\n    Ms. ZUCKERMAN. Sure. Thank you for that question.\\\\n    I think the examples I gave show that it is not true that \\\\nthey do require or expect absolute certainty, and, in fact, in \\\\nscience you never expect absolute certainty. But you do want a \\\\nreasonable assurance that something is likely to work for at \\\\nleast some patients. And that is really what FDA has been \\\\ndoing, as well as making exceptions when a drug is urgently \\\\nneeded for a very serious disease.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Newell, you recently signed a letter of standing with \\\\nthe FDA against judicial interference in the drug approval \\\\nprocess. Can you expand on how a decision like this creates \\\\nuncertainty for your industry?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. As I have explained earlier--thank you for the \\\\nquestion. As I have explained earlier, capital is extremely \\\\nimportant to allow us to do the work that we do developing new \\\\nmedicines. Capital requires certainty. And if the regulatory \\\\nauthority of the FDA is undermined, we do not have certainty \\\\nand, therefore, capital will not be available.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back.\\\\n    And before we go any further, I just want to--you are going \\\\nto see Members going in and out. It is not because they are \\\\nleaving or they are mad or anything. We have got other hearings \\\\nto go back and forth to, so you will see that happen, okay?\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Luetkemeyer from the great \\\\nState of Missouri for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    A few--not too long ago, a year or two ago, we passed a \\\\nbill that says the lengthy permit process across the board is \\\\nreally stymieing a lot of businesses, including the approval of \\\\ndrugs.\\\\n    Ms. Maloy--there we go.\\\\n    And so we had--the bill said you are going to set it two \\\\nyears.\\\\n    Have you seen this kick in yet at all? Have you seen this \\\\nprocess be shortened at all as a result of this bill, Mr. \\\\nMiller--Dr. Miller?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. You mean the FDA review process?\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Yeah. Yeah.\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. Not to my knowledge.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Because the process should have been \\\\nshortened to 2 years.\\\\n    And, Mr. Newell, your process is taking years and years and \\\\nyears.\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. The process has not been shortened.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Process has not been shortened. So our \\\\nbill hasn&#x27;t taken effect yet. We need to start talking about \\\\nthat, don&#x27;t we?\\\\n    You know, Dr. Eagle, you worked in the cancer realm, and in \\\\nmy district, we have the largest nuclear reactor in the country \\\\nat our--on the university campus at the University of Missouri. \\\\nAbout 95 percent of all radiated drugs that are used in cancer \\\\nactually come from that--actually used around the world come \\\\nfrom that nuclear reactor. It is actually at the end of its \\\\nlife span, so we are trying to build a new one. But have you \\\\nused those drugs? How important is it to you to be able to \\\\ncontinue to allow that to happen? Because they do a lot of \\\\nresearch there as well. I don&#x27;t know if you have been utilizing \\\\ntheir services or not.\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Thank you for the question. Those are vitally \\\\nimportant drugs. You know, we have a new prostate cancer drug, \\\\nyou know, that uses a targeted antibody plus a radiation \\\\ntherapy to treat--to treat prostate cancer. We use other types \\\\nof treatments called neuroendocrine tumors where that is a \\\\nvital part of the therapy. It helps people extend lives with \\\\nminimal toxicity. There will be more of those therapies in the \\\\nfuture. It is vital that patients have access to those \\\\ntreatments.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. They do lots of research there. It is \\\\nphenomenal. They have these little molecules that go \\\\ncirculating around the bloodstream looking for cancer cells to \\\\ngo to strike. It is phenomenal stuff. So thank you for that.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, you are involved in a practice. And the concern \\\\nthat I have here deals with this consolidation, just as you \\\\nalluded to with your practice. So some people are going to this \\\\nconcierge care, where you pay a doctor to take care of you, \\\\nwhatever, for a certain price per year or whatever, and--the \\\\ninsurance policy for you to take care--have you seen this \\\\nalready, and what do you think about it? Is it something that \\\\nis----\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. I have seen that primarily in primary care. I \\\\nhave not seen that as much in specialty medicine. In cancer \\\\nmedicine, we try to make every patient a concierge care \\\\npatient. You know, we allow same-day walk-in visits, patients \\\\ndon&#x27;t have to have an appointment, same-day infusions.\\\\n    You know, I think the only place I have really seen that \\\\ntake hold myself is in the primary care sector, but not in \\\\nother fields.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. It goes back to the premise of this \\\\nCommittee from the standpoint of the regulatory burden. I mean, \\\\nit is so difficult for a small practice to continue to do this.\\\\n    Do the concierge care physicians, are they burdened by the \\\\nsame amount of rules and regulations? Have they found a way \\\\naround this? What----\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. In that case, I think the primary change is the \\\\neconomics. You know, they just operate under a different \\\\neconomic system. You know, the private physicians that faced a \\\\ndecline in the fee schedule for 20 years now, and particularly \\\\nwhen you adjust for inflation, payments to physicians is \\\\nautomatically brought down by 26 percent for private \\\\nphysicians.\\\\n    So I think the concierge model of care is just an effort by \\\\ncertain primary care physicians to solve that problem and spend \\\\nmore time with their patients and not have to be their care so \\\\nvolume-driven.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Newell, you are in the business of \\\\ndeveloping drugs. I saw the other day where artificial \\\\nintelligence actually developed a drug for a disease. They put \\\\nin there the parameters to do something and this, you know, \\\\nartificial intelligence came up with a drug.\\\\n    I mean, is this the wave of the future? Am I correct in \\\\nthat?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. We do use artificial intelligence or machine \\\\nlearning to help us identify better targets for our medicines \\\\nand, perhaps in certain cases, the structure of the medicine \\\\nthat we are going to be making.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Will that make it cheaper or does that \\\\nmake it more expensive?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. It is to be determined. I personally do not \\\\nbelieve that a medicine will be fully developed using \\\\nartificial intelligence. There are too many variables in the \\\\nhuman body for us to take into consideration at this point in \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Cancer in particular is a very heterogenous disease, and so \\\\nwhat works in one patient may not work in another.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. And so I think at the end of the day, we need \\\\nto really be cautious about AI, but it can be helpful in \\\\ndevelopment.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Very good. One more question for Dr. \\\\nMiller.\\\\n    You know, the administration is working on descheduling \\\\ncannabis from a schedule I down to schedule III, I believe it \\\\nis. And part of the problem is the USDA--or FDA has never done \\\\nthe research to be able to say that this is justified. Can you \\\\ncomment on that?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. I think that there is still a lot of work to be \\\\ndone to determine what should be done with cannabis. There are \\\\nseveral prescription drug-approved formulations of THC. The FDA \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t have an adequate framework to regulate the other forms \\\\nof cannabis to ensure that is safe and effective for the \\\\naverage consumer.\\\\n    Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Thank you very much. My time has expired.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative McGarvey from the great \\\\nState of Kentucky for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    [Inaudible] I think about my grandmother who passed away \\\\nwith dementia, I think about my dad who lives with Parkinson&#x27;s, \\\\nI think about our dear friends Katie and Ellie battling breast \\\\ncancer.\\\\n    And so many of us have friends and family who are living \\\\nand fighting terrible diseases. And when you are in that spot, \\\\nyou want the same thing. You want them to get better. You want \\\\nhope.\\\\n    And so when I think about this hearing today, I want to \\\\nmake sure that we are framing this in the right way, because \\\\nnot only do you want hope, but you want that hope that they are \\\\ngoing to get better.\\\\n    And I want to tell a little story about a woman named \\\\nFrances Oldham Kelsey. You worked at the FDA; you might have \\\\nheard of her before. This was back in the fifties and sixties. \\\\nOf course, something again that many people faced, morning \\\\nsickness.\\\\n    There was a cancer drug out there, thalidomide, that was \\\\nbeing used in other countries that was helping women with \\\\nmorning sickness. Forty-six other countries approved it. There \\\\nwas all sorts of pressure to approve it here in the United \\\\nStates. One woman at the FDA said no. Imagine the pressure on \\\\nthat one person saying no to get rid of morning sickness.\\\\n    And then it comes out that thalidomide caused incredible \\\\nbirth defects. Tens of thousands of babies around the world \\\\nwere born without limbs, were born with brain defects. The drug \\\\nwas taken off. It was never used. And we did not have--the term \\\\nwas--it was so common, they called them thalidomide babies. It \\\\nwasn&#x27;t--it didn&#x27;t happen here because we had one person who was \\\\nwilling to say, is it safe?\\\\n    So while we want all of our friends, neighbors, and loved \\\\nones to get better, we want them to have that hope, we have to \\\\nhave it be safe. And I will admit, there are obviously \\\\nregulations that are burdensome and can get in the way. But \\\\nregulation itself is not a four-letter word.\\\\n    Regulations have been used to save the lives of everything \\\\nfrom the minors in my State of Kentucky to save the lives of \\\\npeople who actually need these treatments and when they come to \\\\nmarket.\\\\n    And so when we are talking about this today, I want to talk \\\\nabout some of the other things that are actually keeping these \\\\ndrugs from getting them in the hands of the people who want and \\\\nneed them, because that is what we all want. We want people to \\\\nget and be healthy, and we want it to happen safely.\\\\n    So, Dr. Zuckerman, I want to ask you a question. What is a \\\\nbigger barrier to getting new drugs and cheaper drugs to \\\\nmarket? Is it FDA regulations or is it Big Pharma practices \\\\nlike pay for delay, patent manipulation, and side deals with \\\\ngeneric manufacturers that are keeping most people from getting \\\\nthe drugs they want and need?\\\\n    Ms. ZUCKERMAN. Thank you for that question. And I just want \\\\nto say, I met Dr. Kelsey, and she was just a wonderful woman. \\\\nShe lived nearby in Bethesda.\\\\n    There are a lot of--some products are very complicated, and \\\\nthey do take a long time to develop and they take a long time \\\\nto study. But patent manipulation is a huge problem, because \\\\nyou have--you have products like Humira, which have a couple of \\\\nhundred patents--a couple of hundred patents, and they keep \\\\nadding patents to keep it on the market and to prevent any kind \\\\nof competition. So it costs enormous amounts of money to \\\\npatients, and it makes drugs very, very expensive that \\\\notherwise would have generic alternatives that would be much \\\\nless expensive. So I think that is a great example.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.\\\\n    And, again, this is something--we want to encourage \\\\ninnovation, we want to continue developing life-saving drugs to \\\\nget people better. And so, you know, hopefully, that is what we \\\\ncan continue to happen and look at all the reasons why it might \\\\nnot be happening.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    And I now recognize Representative Stauber from the great \\\\nState of Minnesota for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks to all the \\\\nwitnesses here.\\\\n    Mr. Miller, in your comments, you said there is too many \\\\nadministrators in the FDA. You have been part of the FDA. How \\\\ndo we--from our standpoint, how do we legislatively reduce the \\\\nbureaucracy? Like, give me--like, is it a congressional action, \\\\nor is it you, as experts, placing your own to remove the \\\\nburdensome redundant administrators?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. I would say it is oversight and then also the \\\\nuser fee acts.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. And what?\\\\n    Mr. MILLER. The user fee act. So when PDUFA comes up for \\\\nreauthorization, that is a great opportunity to write language \\\\nto encourage the FDA to have reviewers as opposed to managers.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Eagle, you had--you talked about your \\\\nexperience as a small provider, you and two other doctors, and \\\\nthen you were almost forced to be bought up by the large--a \\\\nlarger company. In one of your statements you said, who is in \\\\ncharge of patient care? That is a huge problem, we know, in \\\\nMedicare.\\\\n    I think the vast majority of Americans would say that the \\\\npatient and doctor are in charge. And when the patient and the \\\\ndoctor agree that a 5-night stay in the hospital is needed, \\\\nrather than Medicare saying, no, you should only spent two \\\\nnights there, that is--there is a huge problem going on in our \\\\ncountry where our physicians are undercut by, in this instance, \\\\nMedicare, telling you that your patient didn&#x27;t need 5 days and \\\\nwe are only paying for two. And we know you are going to make \\\\nthe best decision for your patient, not a bureaucrat at a \\\\nthree-letter agency checking off the boxes.\\\\n    That--I am hearing that universally around the country. We \\\\nmust fix that. The patient and the doctor must make those \\\\ndecisions. Thanks for bringing that up. And that is a big lift.\\\\n    Mr. Newell, you have--you have an interesting story on the \\\\nresearch and development of the product. I can tell you right \\\\nnow, I know a physician within this country that is in the \\\\nfinal stages of his new drug, and I know he used it on a COVID \\\\npatient the last--that was the last stretch, this is it, and it \\\\nsaved the patient&#x27;s life.\\\\n    I can&#x27;t imagine--and he has talked to me about the FDA and \\\\nall the process and the bureaucracy. I can&#x27;t imagine how many \\\\nCOVID patients it would have saved had it been allowed--FDA \\\\nallowed it earlier. We won&#x27;t know. But in talking to this \\\\nphysician and others, it is very concerning.\\\\n    We talk about safety. I mean, we want it to be safe. But I \\\\nthink we have to meet a sweet spot here where the research and \\\\ndevelopment, there is timing on this, there is certainty. We \\\\nhave to have, not administrators at the FDA, but people that \\\\nwill look at these drugs and use their professionalism and \\\\nexperience and yea or nay.\\\\n    One of the things that frustrates me is, you know, as a \\\\nsmall business owner--you as a small business owner, just the \\\\nrules and regulations that they force upon you. It is \\\\nunnecessary. I want you and the nurses to have patient care, \\\\nnot pushing paperwork. Thirty-five percent, probably, of your \\\\ntime is pushing paperwork. Would you agree, Doctor?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Absolutely. And to give you an example of some \\\\nof the things that we--that affects how patients are cared for, \\\\nthere is a rule in Medicare that they consider it unreasonable \\\\nfor us to see a patient and give them an injection or an \\\\ninfusion and then see them for that same related problem the \\\\nsame day. The rule is--it is termed modifier 25 because that is \\\\nan exception that insurers and CMS use to except.\\\\n    So, for instance, I might have a patient who is getting a \\\\nshot for anemia and they need to also have the anemia managed. \\\\nThey need to follow the doses, they need to make sure it is \\\\nsafe. I can no longer see that patient on the same day they get \\\\ntheir shot. So the patients--you know, oftentimes their \\\\nchildren have to take off work, their caregivers have to take \\\\noff extra time from work to bring them for the visit with me \\\\nand then bring them on a separate day to receive the injection, \\\\nwhen both could easily be done and it would be much better for \\\\nthem both to be done at the same day.\\\\n    That was not a big issue 3 to 4 years ago. But over the \\\\nlast 2 years, we have had to reeducate our entire staff, \\\\nreorganize our entire office around that rule, and it is \\\\nabsolutely no benefit to the patient.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. My time is up. I want to thank you all for \\\\nyour expert testimony, and thanks for what you are doing to \\\\nyour patients. You are making their lives better.\\\\n    And I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Scholten from the great \\\\nState of Michigan for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.\\\\n    Thank you to our witnesses today.\\\\n    This is such an incredibly important hearing. And I think, \\\\nif we have learned anything from the questions today and the \\\\ntestimony, it is that this is about balance. We need federal \\\\nregulations to keep individuals safe. But I can tell you \\\\nfirsthand from a place like west Michigan where I come from, \\\\nthere are overly burdensome surprise regulations that are \\\\nhampering innovation. And I am grateful that we are having the \\\\nhearing today to talk about it. Let&#x27;s not throw the baby out \\\\nwith the bath water. But let&#x27;s make sure that we have effective \\\\nregulations that are doing what they need to do but are not \\\\ngetting in the way of critical lifesaving drugs and medical \\\\ndevices.\\\\n    Healthcare is growing the economy and saving lives every \\\\nsingle day in west Michigan, from the production of the COVID \\\\nvaccine to innovative cancer research to medical devices that \\\\nare being created right in my home, my backyard.\\\\n    From 2018 to 2021, our State saw a 41.8-percent increase in \\\\nthe establishment of research, testing, and medical \\\\nlaboratories. That is about 6 points higher than the national \\\\naverage. Go blue. I am committed to ensuring that that we ease \\\\nthe burden for our small businesses in this critical market \\\\nwhile also keeping consumers safe.\\\\n    This question is for Dr. Zuckerman. As you have discussed \\\\nin your testimony, the FDA has made concerted efforts to assist \\\\nsmall businesses navigating the regulatory process. Can you \\\\nspeak to the FDA&#x27;s ability to ensure new establishments are \\\\naware of the services that they offer, such as the Center for \\\\nDrug Evaluation and Research and SBIA programs. And are there \\\\nways that this outreach can be improved?\\\\n    Ms. ZUCKERMAN. I am sure there are ways to improve it. I do \\\\nthink that most companies would be aware that, because of the \\\\nUser Fee Act, the FDA is under an obligation to have their \\\\nscientists meet regularly with companies when the companies \\\\nrequest it. The companies do have to request it. But that \\\\nreally helps level the playing field because, otherwise, you \\\\nknow, companies that don&#x27;t have access to expensive consultants \\\\nwould not have that kind of advice that they need of, what do I \\\\nneed to do to get this across the finish line so to speak?\\\\n    But I also just want to mention that device regulations are \\\\nmuch, much different than drugs.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Of course.\\\\n    Ms. ZUCKERMAN. And something like 98 percent of devices get \\\\non the market without even having clinical trials. And you&#x27;d be \\\\nsurprised what that includes. And I will just say a loved one \\\\nis trying to decide how to get treatment for a brain tumor. And \\\\nthere are several products on the market that provide radiation \\\\nthat have never been tested in clinical trials except after \\\\nthey went on the market, and those clinical trials are tiny and \\\\nnot very well conducted because they weren&#x27;t required by the \\\\nFDA. So that is the balance.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Yeah, absolutely.\\\\n    The regulatory process can be lengthy and expensive for \\\\nsmall businesses, we recognize this, who are willing to bring \\\\ntheir product to market. This question is for you, Dr. Miller, \\\\nin your testimony, you discussed different ways to improve \\\\nclinical trial outcomes with greater efficiency. You mentioned \\\\nthe FDA&#x27;s draft guidance regarding decentralized clinical \\\\ntrials. Are there important mechanisms or other tools that can \\\\nbe strengthened within the FDA to assist in the adoption of \\\\nthese practices to support innovative small businesses in \\\\ncommunities like mine, keeping in mind some of the comments \\\\nthat Dr. Zuckerman just made as well.\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. I think it is operationalizing those guidances, \\\\nthat has always been the trouble with the FDA. When you are a \\\\nreviewer, you have NDAs. You have INDs. You have all these \\\\nmeetings and everything comes to you. And then you have six \\\\nlayers of bureaucracy above you telling you to work harder. And \\\\nthe six layers of bureaucracy also can do your job because they \\\\nhad the exact same training. So I think it is deburdening the \\\\nreviewers and making more of them by transforming that \\\\nbureaucracy into more frontline staff who can interface with \\\\ncompanies to help them operationalize those guidances and \\\\nprinciples in their development programs. So the tools are \\\\nthere. It is primarily a human capital management challenge.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Meuser from the great State \\\\nof Pennsylvania for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Thank you very much to our witnesses. We very much \\\\nappreciate you being here. A very interesting subject, very \\\\nimportant subject. I am very glad we are discussing it and has \\\\ndefinitely been informative already.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, I would like to ask you, the H.R. 2474, the \\\\nStrengthening Medicare for Patients and Providers Act. I hear \\\\nall the time from physicians that the reimbursements levels are \\\\na challenge, prior authorization requirements and everything \\\\nelse that takes place. Do you think this act will improve \\\\nthings and make it a little bit more consistent as far as your \\\\nreimbursement levels?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Thank you for the question, Congressman. I \\\\nbelieve that is the act that provides the inflation adjustment, \\\\nso for physician fee scheduling, and so we fully support that.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Okay.\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. If you look at private physician reimbursements, \\\\nit has really been flat or declining over the past 20 years and \\\\nwhile inflation has increased by 26 percent. So there has been \\\\nan effective decline for physician payment over the last 20 \\\\nyears. And that explains much of why private physicians are \\\\ngoing away. The hospitals and nursing homes have those \\\\ninflation adjustments. And I think we would fully support that \\\\nlegislation to level the playing field and give the physicians \\\\nthe resources that they need.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Great.\\\\n    I come from the home medical equipment industry, formally \\\\nDME, powered chairs and mobility equipment and such as that. I \\\\nhonestly have never been a fan of CMS or the FDA, more so as I \\\\nhave gotten into Congress I guess. It seems that even prior \\\\nauthorizations are intended for slowing down payments, \\\\ncontrolling costs rather than actually just dealing with it and \\\\ntalking. And I don&#x27;t mean any particular administration. I mean \\\\nall the way back to W. Bush and even H. Bush and on through. I \\\\njust didn&#x27;t feel that there was the right level of \\\\nunderstanding of what the results were, of what their work was, \\\\nas well as their understanding of what was the most cost-\\\\neffective ways of handling things. And they would tend to beat \\\\nup on the industries that pushed back the least, if you will.\\\\n    So do you feel--Dr. Miller, this is actually for you, do \\\\nyou feel that CMS is listening these days to pharmaceutical \\\\nconcerns and physicians&#x27; concerns?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. No. And I think that is a longstanding \\\\nhistorical problem. One of the things that I think has \\\\nhappened, though, is we have had increasing centralization of \\\\npayment and decision-making. The IRA created centralized \\\\nadministrative pricing for a small group of drugs. There is a \\\\npush to expand that over time. When we look at physician \\\\nservices, 8,000 physician services are written and priced by \\\\nCMS on an annual basis. And that over the past 60 years has \\\\ndestroyed clinical innovation and service delivery. In fact, \\\\nthe industry has had flat or negative labor productivity \\\\ngrowth, and so I am really concerned that the IRA is going to \\\\ndrive that for drugs.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I can&#x27;t help but--why don&#x27;t we have people like \\\\nyou in CMS, you know? I am serious. Or even you, Dr. Eagle?\\\\n    I would like to ask Dr. Newell, Mr. Newell, on your R&amp;D tax \\\\ncredit situation where we are phasing--not us, the R&amp;D tax \\\\ncredit of course is being phased out this year. It is about 80 \\\\npercent less of the deduction than it was last year, very \\\\nsignificant. How does that--and we passed a bill by the way to \\\\nprohibit, to not allow it to sunset. So it is languishing in \\\\nSenate right now. So hopefully that gets resolved. But this of \\\\ncourse was part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2016. Can you \\\\ntell us how that is affecting your business?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. As I explained in my testimony, thank you, \\\\nCongressman, for your question. It is very expensive to develop \\\\nnew medicines, particularly cancer medicines. And I take every \\\\ndollar that we are able to receive from investors or from our \\\\npartners and reinvest them in the people, the technology and \\\\nthe research and development effort that we do. And here we are \\\\n21 years, and we are still not yet at a first approval of a \\\\nmedicine. So that tells you how much investment we have been \\\\nputting into this effort since 2003.\\\\n    This year, for the first time, because of a collaboration \\\\narrangement or arrangements that we made with other companies, \\\\nwe paid $15 million in taxes to the federal government for the \\\\nfirst time ever. That was a remarkable amount of money that did \\\\nnot go to cancer research and development. That would have been \\\\nthe equivalent of two trials, two phase 1 clinical trials to \\\\nstudy new medicines in patients. And that is really remarkable \\\\nto me that, after 80 years, where there was certainty about R&amp;D \\\\ndeductibility now it has gone away, as you have indicated. So \\\\nit is a problem not only for me but for a lot of other \\\\ncompanies as well.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Glusenkamp from the great \\\\nState of Washington for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, I wanted to focus on some of the structural \\\\nfactors that you mentioned in your testimony that impact cost \\\\nin patient care. You note that vertical and horizontal \\\\nconsolidation among insurers and PBMs in particular is a \\\\nparticular challenge to providing quality care for your \\\\npatients. I represent a rural district in southwest Washington \\\\nState, and I hear from my independent pharmacists all the time \\\\nthat this is literally causing them to close their doors. Can \\\\nyou explain more about how it is also negatively impacting \\\\nindependent medical practitioners?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Absolutely. Thank you for your question. So, as \\\\nyou mentioned, there has been tremendous vertical integration, \\\\nparticularly among the PBMs. The PBMs are typically part of the \\\\ninsurance company, and they also have their own specialty \\\\npharmacies and independent pharmacies. So they have a \\\\nmotivation to use those pharmacies. So they use different tools \\\\nlike restrictive networks and contracting terms that are less \\\\nfavorable to either independent pharmacies or pharmacies like \\\\nours that provide medications for patients. So we provide oral \\\\ncancer medications for patients, but the way we do it is \\\\nthrough medically integrated dispensing. So our pharmacy team \\\\nis located in or clinics. We are connected to the EMR. We know \\\\nwhat is happening to the patients. We never supply 90 days of \\\\ndrugs because we know that those expensive medications need to \\\\nbe held or the doses changed. But the PDMs frankly try to do \\\\neverything they can to get those prescriptions routed to their \\\\nown specialty pharmacies.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. So how has that impacted, like, an \\\\nindependent physician? Is this kind of going to cause them to \\\\nclose or, I mean, have to join a bigger practice?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. When I was part of a smaller practice in North \\\\nCarolina, we simply couldn&#x27;t have a pharmacy, it was just too \\\\ncomplicated to do that. As part of my practice in New York, we \\\\nhave six free-standing pharmacy sites that provide tremendous \\\\nvalue to patients.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. So what do you advise Congress to do \\\\nabout this?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Well, I think absolutely with the PBMs there has \\\\nto be transparency. I think that is the first step. That it is \\\\ngoing to take far more than transparency. I think that the fact \\\\nthat they can refer to their own--give referrals to their own \\\\nin-house pharmacies needs to be looked at. We are also seeing \\\\nproblems now with below water drug reimbursement. So pharmacies \\\\nare now reimbursing less than the amount of the drug, and \\\\nnobody can continue to operate that way. I--there are rules \\\\nalready that preclude that, but we need CMS to enforce those \\\\nrules.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Okay. Hospital systems too have \\\\ngrown significantly consolidated, as you mentioned in \\\\ntestimony. Can you explain the impact that that level of \\\\nconsolidation has on patients and healthcare costs for the \\\\ncountry as a whole? Often we hear that the hospital \\\\nconsolidation is justified because it is more cost-effective or \\\\nefficient. But do patients end up bearing the cost of that?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. No. Thank you for that question also. They \\\\nabsolutely do. Hospitals charge more through the facility fees \\\\nso they have a different set of charges. They cost more than \\\\nMedicare because they are paid under a different fee schedule \\\\nthan private offices. They are able to negotiate much higher \\\\ncommercial contract rates with private insurers, and so patient \\\\ncopayments can be very high. And just the entire insurance plan \\\\ncosts can be higher because those costs have to be borne by the \\\\nplans as well also.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. How do we work to help encourage \\\\nmore competition in the system and help independent practices \\\\nthrive again?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Yeah. I thank you for that question also. I \\\\nthink payment parity is a nice little--is an excellent place to \\\\nstart. I mean, there is no reason that we should be paying one \\\\nsystem more for providing the exact same service as another. I \\\\nthink 340b is another driver as well also. Some hospitals do \\\\nneed 340b, but a lot of hospitals are making tremendous profits \\\\noff of that program that don&#x27;t necessarily provide the energy \\\\nand care that that program, you know, would imply. That is \\\\nanother factor that is driving consolidation in healthcare. In \\\\nfact, that was one of the motivators, you know, for hospitals \\\\nto want to acquire oncology practices because the profits from \\\\nthat program are very desirable.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you very much.\\\\n    We know that we just saw the last Medicare trustee report a \\\\nfew days ago, which warns that Medicare will face shortfalls in \\\\n12 years that will require higher premiums and limits on \\\\nservices or both.\\\\n    Dr. Zuckerman, how can innovation reduce such shortfalls, \\\\nor other policy changes we can help ensure Medicare coverage is \\\\nsustainable for those who count on it?\\\\n    Ms. ZUCKERMAN. Thank you for that question.\\\\n    In the ideal world, of course innovation would save money \\\\nin terms of healthcare, but that is not what has been \\\\nhappening. So many--well, we did a study of cancer drugs and \\\\nfound that many cancer drugs that had been approved actually \\\\nwere never proven to save people&#x27;s lives, to help people live \\\\nlonger, or to improve the quality of life. So, in fact, the \\\\nopposite seems to be true that, when Medicare is a little bit \\\\nmore careful or when the FDA is a little bit more careful about \\\\nwhat products are approved, that saves money, and that can save \\\\na lot of money.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you very much for your \\\\nresponse.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Van Duyne from the great \\\\nState of Texas for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    And, Dr. Miller, it is great to see you again.\\\\n    Last July, the Oversight Subcommittee, which I Chair, held \\\\na hearing on the overregulation in healthcare and the impact \\\\nthat it has on small businesses. And I am glad to see that we \\\\nare holding this hearing with the full committee today, given \\\\nthe level of bipartisan concern regarding how this \\\\noverregulation is hurting our healthcare system.\\\\n    In Texas&#x27; 24th District, I have hosted a number of \\\\nroundtables with doctors. And I have always made it a point to \\\\nask them how much of their time is spent in front of a computer \\\\non a screen as opposed to talking to their patients, as opposed \\\\nto actually doing the job that they signed up for, that they \\\\nstudied for. And their answers are always astonishing to me; \\\\nanywhere between 65 and 90 percent of their time is spent \\\\nchecking boxes that CMS has put in front of them. It is not \\\\nhelping their patients. It is not decreasing costs. It is not \\\\nincreasing quality. It is spent on regulatory issues. And it is \\\\njust shocking to hear that. And this is time that they would \\\\nobviously rather prefer to spend with their patients, and \\\\nguarantee you it is time that patients would rather, you know, \\\\nspend talking to their doctors.\\\\n    And I will never forget a meeting with a doctor who was \\\\nforced to sell her own practice because she said she just \\\\ncouldn&#x27;t afford to do it anymore. And she said now that she is \\\\nbasically not practicing medicine, but she is just filling in \\\\nboxes, that she just feels like a monkey could do her job \\\\nbecause she is only following regulations, not practicing \\\\nmedicine.\\\\n    And, where regulatory costs reached the point that it is no \\\\nlonger feasible for small private healthcare practices to keep \\\\nthe doors open, it only leads to one thing, which is \\\\nconsolidation. And this is decreasing the quality of care. It \\\\neliminates competition, which increases costs. And it limits \\\\nthe possibility of physicians owning their own businesses. And \\\\nthat restricts access to care, and it hurts patients. We can&#x27;t \\\\ncontinue to allow overregulation to shut the doors of small \\\\ncare providers. And I am glad our committee is focused on \\\\nfinding solutions to better provide better and more affordable \\\\nquality care, patient care.\\\\n    But, not only are this administration&#x27;s policies hurting \\\\nsolo and small physician practices, but they are also hampering \\\\nour ability to be able to provide much-needed new \\\\npharmaceuticals and drugs into the market that are produced by \\\\nour highly regulated U.S. manufacturers. And, at the same time, \\\\nthough, these policies seem to be actually--policies like the \\\\nInflation Reduction Act, which Dr. Miller, you were speaking of \\\\nearlier, but they are actually enriching and empowering some of \\\\nour most adverse foreign agents.\\\\n    So, Dr. Miller, I am going to ask you, can you tell us how \\\\nChina is using the Inflation Reduction Act against us when it \\\\ncomes to new drugs?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    China views the biopharmaceutical industry as a place where \\\\nit wants to completely dominate. The IRA sent a massive \\\\nnegative signal to all entrepreneurs, small companies and large \\\\ncompanies basically saying that you are going to undergo \\\\ncentralized administrative price regulation. That, plus the \\\\ninability for the FDA to modernize clinical trials means that \\\\nthe cost of developing drugs and doing trials in the U.S. and \\\\nmanufacturing is very high.\\\\n    I know people who are building companies, developing new \\\\ntherapies, and they are looking at lower cost sites. And they \\\\nalways ask me about China. They want to manufacture products in \\\\nChina. They want to do clinical trials in China. So that \\\\nscientific knowledge, that technical knowledge that \\\\nmanufacturing knowledge, the clinical knowledge, in addition to \\\\nall of the jobs which are highly paid and created a great \\\\ninnovative economic and scientific ecosystem, those ecosystems \\\\nare leaving for China. And we just passed a law that sent--and \\\\ntold the pharmaceutical industry to do more development in \\\\nChina where it is lower cost. So we essentially functionally \\\\nsupported our greatest adversary.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Wow. Look, it has been almost a year or two \\\\nsince you testified in this committee about overregulation in \\\\nhealthcare. Do you think things have gotten better, or do you \\\\nthink things have gotten worse?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. Worse. I would say that I spend most of my time \\\\ntyping. And I remember one of my professors in medical school \\\\nsaid I would be an excellent physician because I was a very \\\\nfast typist.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Dr. Eagle, I am going to ask you the same \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Things have clearly gotten worse. And thank you \\\\nfor the question. Your point about EMR could not be more on \\\\ntarget. That is kind of where the rubber meets the road between \\\\na lot of the regulatory requirements and how physicians spend \\\\ntheir time, and it is a huge burden for physicians to kind of \\\\nspend all day checking boxes in the electronic medical record.\\\\n    A lot of EMRs are really--involve the billing systems, so, \\\\nyou know, the priorities of the EMRs are check-the-box \\\\ndocumentation requirements and billing and not true medical \\\\ndecisionmaking that actually benefits patients, you know. I \\\\nwill get 5-page documents from other physicians with a list of \\\\ndiagnosis codes, a list of medications, a list of previous \\\\ndiagnosis, but very little about what they are actually \\\\nthinking about what the patient needs and what the plan of care \\\\nshould be. And that is a lot of how a lot of these regulatory \\\\nissues get transferred to physicians is through the EMR. It is \\\\na major source of burnout for physicians, and I thank you for \\\\nmaking those points.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Alford from the great State \\\\nof Missouri for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking Member, for \\\\nholding this. And thank you of course to our witnesses today.\\\\n    I represent 772,047 people in a very rural district of \\\\nMissouri. The Fourth Congressional District. And rural \\\\nhealthcare is kind of at a crisis point I think in America. \\\\nFacing the continuing healthcare crisis, providers are being \\\\nforced to shut down or withhold the vital services that they \\\\nprovided to communities they serve.\\\\n    Rural Americans are uniquely vulnerable to the downstream \\\\neffects of regulatory burden being forced upon the healthcare \\\\nindustry. That is why I am glad we are having this hearing \\\\ntoday, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    We have visited numerous hospitals in our district. We have \\\\nheard firsthand the impact regulations have had on small \\\\nbusinesses in our district. When rural providers are forced to \\\\nshut down, it can leave their patients stranded hours away from \\\\nthe healthcare that they need and that they deserve. While \\\\ntelehealth is helping meet some of those needs, only 22 percent \\\\nof our constituents in our district have high-speed internet \\\\nthat is capable of taking part in this technology.\\\\n    So, Dr. Eagle, I want to start with you. You talked about \\\\nhow difficult it was to maintain your independent practice, \\\\nthat you eventually was forced to join a large hospital system. \\\\nIt is something I hear from my constituents well. They are \\\\nworried they won&#x27;t be able to continue their small practices \\\\nthat serve rural Americans. Why is it so difficult to maintain \\\\na small practice, especially in rural America?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. I think the two primary drivers--thank you for \\\\nthe question--are economics and regulations, you know. I think \\\\nthat the practice I had in North Carolina was more suburban \\\\nthan rural, but I think the problems are largely similar. I \\\\nthink rural practices suffer from all the same problems that \\\\nthe other practices do, but regulation is harder to manage in \\\\nthose situations. And reimbursement has been declining for the \\\\nprivate offices, the same as for everybody else.\\\\n    I can&#x27;t speak as an expert on rural medicine in that regard \\\\nbecause I never have practiced in a true rural setting. But I \\\\nthink the problems are the same; it is just harder to solve.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Miller, another concern I have heard about from my \\\\nconstituents is about CMS&#x27; efforts on this great idea of \\\\ndecarbonization. We have got to decarbonize healthcare at a \\\\ntime when rural hospitals are struggling to keep their doors \\\\nopen. CMS--I was being flippant there, if you don&#x27;t know that--\\\\nis releasing guidance asking hospitals and healthcare providers \\\\nto monitor and address their emissions. This is a slap in the \\\\nface to rural hospitals in my district. In fact, the Golden \\\\nValley Memorial Hospital in Clinton, Henry County, told me that \\\\nto replace a single boiler with a clean alternate that the CMS \\\\nwants is going to be $3 million bucks, $3 million. Do you think \\\\nthat CMS is fulfilling their statutory duties in attempting to \\\\nbrowbeat hospitals into decarbonizing?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. Absolutely not. That is completely out of scope \\\\nfor CMS.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. It is kind of crazy, isn&#x27;t?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. Yeah, there is a long history of using the \\\\nconditions of participation in Medicare to attach a favored \\\\nregulation. And CMS&#x27; primary goal is--should be to assist in \\\\nrunning the State Medicaid programs and to run Medicare.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Should be.\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. It is not an environmental regulator and should \\\\nnot be.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, back to you. I have often heard from small rural \\\\nhospitals that are really struggling this year. I visited the \\\\nBates County Memorial Hospital, a great crew there, a small \\\\nfacility in Butler, Missouri. And they told me that, in 2022, \\\\nthey lost nearly $2 million providing for Medicare patients. I \\\\nknow we have some bills out there that is going to help with \\\\ntheir reimbursements. But what do we do in the meantime? How \\\\ncan these small hospitals and doctors who want to serve--truly \\\\nit is almost a ministry to them out in the rural communities--\\\\nhow do they stay alive?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. I know. Thank you for that question. I cannot \\\\nspeak as an expert on hospital administration. But I think that \\\\nprograms like 340b are designed to support, you know, programs, \\\\nhospitals like those. And I think that, you know, redesigning \\\\nthat program to actually truly meet the hospitals that need the \\\\nfunds would be a step in the right direction.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Well, thank you. I truly think this is a very \\\\nimportant hearing that we are having today. And I thank you for \\\\nbeing here.\\\\n    And, with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Thanedar from the great \\\\nState of Michigan for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. THANEDAR. Thank you, Chairman Williams and Ranking \\\\nMember, for hosting this important discussion.\\\\n    And I thank all the witnesses here.\\\\n    Look now, I came here as an immigrant, got a Ph.D. in \\\\nchemistry, did my post doc at the University of Michigan, and \\\\nshortly thereafter started a small innovation research company. \\\\nSo this feels like something that I have done for 25 years. A \\\\nlot of what we did was develop pharmaceutical formulations, \\\\nmade clinical trial materials for small startup businesses. \\\\nMany startup businesses, very innovative, you know. A lot of \\\\ninnovation, as you know, happens in small Pharma companies. But \\\\noften they don&#x27;t have the resources to do all of the drug \\\\ndevelopment process, do all of the regulatory QAQC testing, all \\\\nof that. So I had a facility that had 65 scientists at one \\\\ntime, Ph.D. scientists, equipment, formulation, a CGMP \\\\nfacility. So I could provide these kind of services and do \\\\ninnovation. And that helped, because often, you know, some \\\\nsmall segments of population that has a rare disease doesn&#x27;t \\\\nget noticed by large Pharma because there is just not enough \\\\nprofits in there. And so a lot of small innovative companies \\\\nare working on that. And what I have noticed is the burden from \\\\nFDA, the delays getting responses, and overall not having the \\\\nresources, financial resources to be able to develop these \\\\ndrugs. And my question to you all is that, what can Congress do \\\\nto facilitate such innovation? What can Congress do to keep our \\\\nscientific community at the top of innovation, discoveries, and \\\\nkeep our leadership in this area? As a pharmaceutical \\\\nscientist, I am very interested in your answers here. Anybody.\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. So I think, moving more towards \\\\ndecentralization of pricing, as opposed to centralization, \\\\nwhich is what we did with the IRA. I think another thing, as I \\\\nsaid, is clinical trial reform, because the small companies \\\\nneed guidance. If a small the company gets one meeting on Zoom \\\\n6 months into their development program and they have lots of \\\\nquestions that they need answered in those first 3 or 6 months \\\\nas they are setting up trials and making decisions, they need \\\\nto be able access the brain. They can&#x27;t pay someone $2,000 an \\\\nhour who has been doing this in the space for 30 years. They \\\\nneed the FDA reviewer brain who has been in the space for 15, \\\\n20 years and sits in that entire area and has seen 15 to 20 \\\\nyears of development programs through INDs, NDAs, sNDAs, et \\\\ncetera. So, we need to make sure that the FDA is a partner to \\\\nthe small companies and entrepreneurs. Those SBIA programs are \\\\ngreat, but they are not a substitute for having that \\\\nscientific, clinical, and technical guidance available at the \\\\nfingertips for those entrepreneurs.\\\\n    Mr. THANEDAR. Anybody else?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. Thank you, Congressman.\\\\n    As a CEO of a company that is developing new medicines \\\\nstarting at the 19th employee and now 300 employees, with our \\\\nCGMP manufacturing facility, I know a lot of what you talk \\\\nabout. The hurdles that we have from a regulatory standpoint \\\\nare enormous. And that requires a tremendous amount of capital \\\\nand expertise.\\\\n    In the development process for our lead program, we started \\\\nclinical development in 2019. Here we are in 2024, and we are \\\\nstill 2 to 3 years away from having the data set that will be \\\\nsatisfactory for FDA.\\\\n    One of things that we have had to do is to satisfy a new \\\\ninitiative within FDA called Project Optimus where they are \\\\ntrying to get companies to not identify the most effective dose \\\\nfor the patient, but the lowest, most effective dose for the \\\\npatient. And so, while we were prepared to start our pivotal \\\\ntrial about a year ago, we had to first study two doses of our \\\\ndrugs in 50 patients, and that will delay our trial about a \\\\nyear. So there are actions that Congress can take to allow and \\\\nincentivize FDA I think to accelerate development rather than \\\\nhinder development.\\\\n    Mr. THANEDAR. Thank you so much. I am out of time, but I \\\\nwould love to work with you, all of you. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Maloy from the great State \\\\nof Utah for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have been sitting \\\\nhere listening to your testimony. I had a whole list of \\\\nquestions I wanted to ask, and most of them have already been \\\\nasked. That is one of advantages of being junior on a \\\\ncommittee; you get to learn to think on your feet. But it seems \\\\nclear that we need to do a better job at trials and approvals. \\\\nIt seems like we are hearing a lot of that.\\\\n    And, as a Member of Congress, I am nervous about this \\\\nconversation because having Congress get involved isn&#x27;t always \\\\nhelpful when we are trying to get things to be more efficient \\\\nand quicker, but we do have oversight responsibilities with \\\\nFDA. And I just want to ask, what can we do that would help \\\\nwith the efficiency of approvals and trials without adding more \\\\nbureaucracy and making it more cumbersome? I want to start with \\\\nDr. Miller. I know you have covered this, but I just want to be \\\\nreally clear, how can we help without getting in the way?\\\\n    Dr. MILLER. So the specific things to ask is, how many \\\\nstaff are in each center, and what are the tasks that they are \\\\ndoing? Another thing is, how long does a company have to wait \\\\nto get a meeting? How long do they have to wait to get an in-\\\\nperson meeting? How frequently are the staff in the office? I \\\\nrealize some work can be done remotely, but when you are doing \\\\nintellectual collaborative, frankly, highly creative and \\\\ninterdisciplinary work, you need to be able to walk down the \\\\nhall. We had a guy in our group whom we called the grand \\\\nmentor. He had been there 30 years. We bought him a seersucker \\\\njacket. He had basically seen everything. You would just walk \\\\ndown the hall and ask him questions because he had been there \\\\nforever. That doesn&#x27;t happen if you are all working remotely at \\\\nhome 30 minutes to hours away from the agency. So I would say \\\\nmaking sure also people get back to the office.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Dr. Eagle?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. I can&#x27;t speak as an authority on clinical trials \\\\nthe way Dr. Miller can. But I will just tell you, in 40 percent \\\\nof the FDA-approved therapies in oncology--or 40 percent of the \\\\nFDA-approved therapies are oncology drugs and is how we make \\\\nprogress. It is critical to be able to do these trials in the \\\\ncommunity, and we do those in our practice. It is a lot of \\\\nwork, though. But the trials are better when they are, you \\\\nknow, in communities because the results are more accurate. You \\\\nget better diversity of trial participants, and the trial \\\\nresults translate into the real world better than if they are \\\\nall done at academic centers.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Mr. Newell?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. Thank you for your question.\\\\n    I would like to build on what Dr. Miller said. When we go \\\\nthrough the regulatory process with the FDA, we have a number \\\\nof meetings. Some of them are on what are called CMC, chemistry \\\\nmanufacturing and control subjects, basically how we make our \\\\nmedicine. Some of them are on the design of the trial. Some of \\\\nthem are on the statistical plans that underpin the design of \\\\nthe trials. Even though we are in California, we would welcome \\\\nthe opportunity for in-person meetings. I don&#x27;t think we have \\\\nhad an in-person meeting in the 6 years that we have been in \\\\nclinical development at Sutro Biopharma. We do get Zoom \\\\nmeetings. They usually occur at the very end of the time period \\\\nat which they have to grant the meeting. And not everyone is on \\\\ncamera during the Zoom meetings themselves. So there is a huge \\\\nbarrier I think to the proper exchange of information and \\\\ngetting to the right answers for the company and for the \\\\nregulatory system and being in-person and or being on camera \\\\nwould be a great step forward for us in terms of that \\\\ncommunication efficiency.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, I want to come back to you. Sorry, I am going to \\\\nskip Dr. Zuckerman for a minute. My colleague from Washington \\\\ncovered a lot of this, but I also hear a lot of frustration \\\\nfrom independent pharmacists and independent healthcare \\\\nproviders about, you know, the vertical integration that is \\\\nmaking their lives harder and making it harder for them to \\\\ncompete. And, when you were answering questions about that \\\\nearlier, you said we need more transparency in PBMs. Do you \\\\nwant to just quickly tell us what that would look like?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Well, I think, if you look at the economics of \\\\nPBMs, there is--it is a little misunderstood about how--where \\\\nthe money goes. They are truly the only entity in the entire \\\\nprocess, and when they contract, it really sees all contracts \\\\nand really knows how the money flows. So I think that would be \\\\na first step.\\\\n    So, if you look at where drugs rebates go, whether those \\\\nsavings really get passed on to the patients in the plans, that \\\\nis just not entirely clear. It is stated that that happens, but \\\\nwe just don&#x27;t know that. So I think transparency would be a \\\\nfirst start, but I think the legislation after that would need \\\\nto follow as well.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Okay. Mr. Newell, last question for you, and I \\\\nam almost out of time so really quick answer. But how \\\\nimportant--it is troubling to me that you are 21 years old and \\\\nstill not commercial. How important is the timing of \\\\nreimbursements for small businesses that develop breakthrough \\\\ntechnologies from Medicare?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. It is vital. You know, when we do this work, we \\\\nwant to get a medicine to a patient, and we need to ensure that \\\\nthe patient has no barrier to getting that. So reimbursement is \\\\nvital to the whole ecosystem.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Molinaro from the great \\\\nState of New York for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Although, every time \\\\nyou say ``the great State of New York,&#x27;&#x27; I always have chuckled \\\\nthat not only, obviously, are small businesses overburdened by \\\\nfederal regulations--I talked a great deal about that, and we \\\\nare going to get into that in a little bit--but it is even \\\\nworse in the State of New York. Sadly the federal/state \\\\nregulatory regime has not only used overregulation as an \\\\nenforcement mechanism, but sadly, absent both Congress and even \\\\nthe State legislature&#x27;s involvement, enforcement and regulation \\\\nis used as policymaking. And that is a frightening recipe and, \\\\nquite frankly, has led to so much consolidation and smaller \\\\nbusinesses, smaller practices, and smaller providers leaving \\\\nthe community.\\\\n    For rural communities like the ones I represent in upstate \\\\nNew York, without question, small independent providers serve \\\\nas a critical lifeline for patients in connecting them with \\\\nhigh-quality and affordable medical services. We acknowledge \\\\nthis. From skyrocketing regulatory compliance cost to labor \\\\nshortages, it is clear our small providers, especially those in \\\\nrural communities, are struggling to stay afloat. It is one of \\\\nthe reasons I sponsored the Healthcare Workforce Innovation Act \\\\nto ensure qualified medical, behavioral, and oral health \\\\nprofessionals can practice in medically underserved and rural \\\\ncommunities. We, in upstate New York, sadly live in medical \\\\ndeserts.\\\\n    As healthcare consolidation has accelerated over the past \\\\ntwo decades, the number of independent practices continues to \\\\nshrink. You have all acknowledged this. And, according to the \\\\nAmerican Independent Medical Practice Association, from 2019 to \\\\n2022, the share of physicians working hospital health systems \\\\nor other large corporations grew from 62 to 74 percent. And I \\\\nworry that that has accelerated even more so in communities \\\\nthroughout New York.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, I want to return to some of your testimony where \\\\nyou elaborate a bit on how CMS regulation enacted during COVID-\\\\n19--which, by the way, I lived on the front line of public \\\\nhealth as a county executive during COVID-19. When we didn&#x27;t \\\\nknow what we didn&#x27;t know, we made decisions that made sense. \\\\nAnd then we knew a lot and started to make even more decisions \\\\nthat made no sense. One such regulation barred the independent \\\\nmedical practices from delivering to patients medications via \\\\nmail or similar delivery means, which of course made no sense \\\\nduring COVID. It makes even less sense now. I joined 53 of my \\\\ncolleagues in issuing a letter urging HHS and CMS to reconsider \\\\nthis regulation to help ensure patients&#x27; and their medical \\\\nproviders&#x27; needs are accounted for in the regulator process.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, if you could, just share a little bit more about \\\\nyour experience as a small provider--modest provider, not so \\\\nsmall but small provider, navigating the burdens of the \\\\nregulatory environment and the impact this particular order had \\\\non patient care.\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Thank you so much for the question.\\\\n    As I mentioned previously, what we do in our practice is \\\\nmedically integrated dispensing so it is different when \\\\npatients get their oral drugs from us than when they do from a \\\\nPBM, because the PBMs, they don&#x27;t do the same patient support, \\\\nfinancial support. There is a loss of--they don&#x27;t know the \\\\ncritical record.\\\\n    The new CMS regulation is a massive burden, and it was \\\\nissued through an FAQ, which is not the typical rulemaking \\\\nprocess. So that in itself was problematic. But we can no \\\\nlonger mail these drugs to patients. Only the PBMs can mail \\\\ndrugs to patients. So sick cancer patients now have to \\\\nphysically come into the office to pick up their medications. \\\\nIt is not even allowed that the patient&#x27;s family members can \\\\ncome to the office and pick up the medications. The patients \\\\nthemselves who are battling cancer have to make these trips. In \\\\nrural areas, in New York, that can be a huge burden, but just \\\\ngetting around the Long Island area and New York City can be a \\\\nchallenge as well also. So that is prime issue that really \\\\nneeds scrutiny. And it would be very easy for CMS to reverse \\\\nthis requirement, but we are very disappointed that they seem \\\\nto be dug in on this.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. As are many of us. And if we think the \\\\nhealthcare system--and, again, I try to localize it a bit, the \\\\nhealthcare system in New York is a bit on life support as it \\\\nis; The mental healthcare system is relatively nonexistent. And \\\\naccess to medications in a more fluid and accessible way for \\\\nthose dealing with mental illnesses is critically important.\\\\n    I just want to very quickly reference, in my district, \\\\nthere are several small domestic pharmaceutical companies and \\\\nmanufacturers, including Alvogen, that experience extreme \\\\nchallenges working with federal bureaucracy. Lacking certainty \\\\nin matters involving the government is a challenge for any \\\\nbusiness of any size. It is one of the reasons this committee \\\\nexists, but it is especially challenging for small companies \\\\nthat lack financial resources to stay afloat during periods of \\\\ntime while they wait on government to act.\\\\n    For any of you, if you would, in my 20 seconds, how does \\\\nthat uncertainty in the bureaucratic red tape impact the \\\\nability in particular to small biotech companies to meet \\\\nproviders&#x27; needs?\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. Congressman, maybe I will answer that quickly.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Please.\\\\n    Mr. NEWELL. In order to raise capital, we need to chart a \\\\npath for the medicines that we are developing. And we need to \\\\npersuade investors that we know that that path is achievable. \\\\nWhen there is uncertainty from a regulatory standpoint, \\\\ninvestors sense that uncertainty, and they are less likely to \\\\ninvest. And, without capital, we are not able to bring new \\\\nmedicines to the market.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative LaLota from the great State \\\\nof New York for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. The great State of New York, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. That is what I said.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Yes, sir. It is easy to agree with you, Mr. \\\\nChairman.\\\\n    Dr. Eagle, it is always nice to welcome a fellow New \\\\nYorker, a fellow Long Islander, to Washington. You have more \\\\nthan 20 years&#x27; experience in healthcare, with specialized \\\\ntraining in diagnosing and treating cancer. Additionally, you \\\\nare the past president of the Community Oncology Alliance and \\\\nare acutely aware of how overregulation affects small \\\\npractices.\\\\n    The matter of cancer, we have heard it from several of our \\\\nMembers today, is a personal one to us and our constituents. Me \\\\nin particular, in March 2006, I lost my father after a yearlong \\\\nbattle to lymphoma. He died in Mather Hospital in Port \\\\nJefferson. He was a big, strapping, strong Italian man. And the \\\\ndisease ate him away in many different ways. My three daughters \\\\nborn after never got to meet him.\\\\n    And, before I ask you a few questions, I want to commend \\\\nyou for your lifetime of dedication to work in this field to \\\\ntry to bring comfort to many families, to try to treat and end \\\\nthis disease. It is commendable that you have spent your \\\\nprofessional life on this endeavor.\\\\n    Specifically and switching gears a little bit, one thing \\\\nthat stood out to me in your written testimony is that your \\\\npractice treats all patients, including Medicaid. Are you \\\\ntelling me or are you saying that other hospital systems in the \\\\nNew York area do not treat patients who use Medicaid?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Thank you for the question.\\\\n    To the best of my knowledge, that is true, you know. We \\\\nparticipate in all insurance plans in New York. That is a \\\\nrarity in New York, frankly. We participate in all the Medicaid \\\\nplans. I don&#x27;t believe the nonprofit hospitals do participate \\\\nin all the Medicaid plans. So, you know, we really try to take \\\\ncare of the community. I think, when a lot of people look how \\\\nto build healthcare and who provide subsidies to, they look to \\\\nnonprofit hospitals. But I think, in New York, it is notable \\\\nthat our practice, which is 80-plus million oncologists, we \\\\naccept all the insurance plans and work very hard to stay in \\\\nall networks.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. What do you think is the impact of others not \\\\naccepting Medicaid?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Well, you can&#x27;t help a patient unless you see \\\\nthem. The only way you can help a cancer patient is being in \\\\ntheir community and give them access to your clinic and their \\\\ncare.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Great, thanks. And can you describe how \\\\noncology care has changed for patients, doctors, and staff \\\\nafter your practice transitioned from your small private \\\\npractice to your large regional health system?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. When we were a three-physician practice, we \\\\nstarted every Monday at 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning with a 30-\\\\nminute meeting with the entire staff, talking about clinic \\\\noperations, how to do little things right. When you are in \\\\nsmall private practice, the only thing you can do is win on \\\\nquality and service. We had no other structural advantages. So \\\\nit was just critically important to make sure that all the \\\\nstaff was involved with every part of the clinic and making it \\\\noperate as efficient as it possibly could and welcoming to the \\\\npatients as it possibly could. Unfortunately, with the \\\\ntransition to the hospital, we lost a quarter of our employees \\\\nbefore the changes even happened. They just did not want to \\\\nwork for a hospital system. I think today maybe even less than \\\\none-third are left. So much of the efficiencies, so much of the \\\\npersonalized care, so much of the things that we personally \\\\nenjoyed about taking care of cancer patients just became harder \\\\nto do.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Yeah. We want to take care of patients. We want \\\\nto take care of constituents. Can you describe to the committee \\\\nthe difference between how a hospital does this or how a \\\\nprivate physician office like yours approaches this? And, \\\\nspecifically, is there an unlevel playing field between the \\\\ntwo?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. Structurally there is a tremendously unlevel \\\\nplaying field. Particularly in oncology, there is the 340b \\\\nprogram. So hospital oncology programs and nonprofit hospitals \\\\ncan drop substantial profits from that program. They derive \\\\nhigher commercial contract reimbursement. But they also get \\\\npaid facility fees under the Medicare program and just higher \\\\npayments generally across the board for Medicare for the same \\\\nservices.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. And the dynamic that seems to favor the large \\\\nhospitals, is that hurting patient care, or are the patients \\\\ndisadvantaged with the unlevel playing field?\\\\n    Dr. EAGLE. You know, when I transitioned into the hospital, \\\\nI was able to see about one-third fewer patients. So I think \\\\npatients begin to wait longer for appointments. They are paying \\\\nhigher costs both commercially and through facility fees on \\\\nMedicare. So I think it has tremendous patient impacts.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate all of \\\\nyour feedback today. This is one of the more functional \\\\ncommittees in Congress. The Republicans and Democrats seem to \\\\nagree on a decent amount of things. We have produced a fair \\\\namount of legislation subsequent to testimony from folks like \\\\nyou. So I want to say thanks so much for being here.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    And I would like to thank our witnesses today for their \\\\ntestimony, for you appearing. It has been a good hearing, and \\\\none--I think we love to have people come up and go before our \\\\ncommittee because, most of the time, we are pretty bipartisan. \\\\nWe see things as they should be and try to get something done.\\\\n    Without objection, Members have 5 legislative days to \\\\nsubmit additional materials and written questions for the \\\\nwitnesses to the Chair, which will be forwarded to the \\\\nwitnesses. I ask the witnesses to please respond promptly if \\\\nthat happens. And I have no further business.\\\\n    Without objection, the committee is adjourned.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 11:48 a.m., the committee was adjourned.]\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n                            A P P E N D I X\\\\n\\\\n              [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73163/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"04/17/2024\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"MARKUP OF: H.R. 7984, THE RURAL SMALL BUSINESS RESILIENCE ACT;

The committee will now come to order. A \\\\nquorum is present. Without objection, the Chair is authorized \\\\nto declare recess of the committee at any time. As required by \\\\nHouse rules, a copy of the legislative measures have been made \\\\navailable to the Members and the public at least 24 hours in \\\\nadvance.\\\\n    Pursuant to committee rule 13 and House rule XI, all votes \\\\nwill be rolled to the end of the meeting. I now recognize \\\\nmyself for opening remarks.\\\\n    Good morning again and welcome to today&#x27;s markup where we \\\\nwill be discussing seven bills that will address the needs of \\\\nour nation&#x27;s small business. I am going to be speaking on each \\\\nof the bills we bring up today in much greater detail so I will \\\\nkeep these remarks very brief.\\\\n    To put it bluntly, Main Street America has been forced to \\\\nplay defense every day thanks to this administration&#x27;s \\\\nregulatory agenda. My colleagues and I on this committee have \\\\nthe privilege of being main street&#x27;s voice in Washington and \\\\nthat is why our work is so important.\\\\n    Moreover, it is our job we put forward meaningful policy \\\\nsolutions that will help our nation&#x27;s job creators. When small \\\\nbusinesses can hire more employees and reinvest in their \\\\nbusinesses and communities the country operates at its very \\\\nbest.\\\\n    The seven bills before us today have been discussed widely \\\\nby all Members and staff, and for that I am very grateful. Now \\\\nbefore us today are bills that improve access to disaster \\\\nassistance for those in rural areas, increase employment \\\\nopportunities for people with disabilities, and require federal \\\\ncontracts to be written in plain language, I repeat plain \\\\nlanguage, so small businesses won&#x27;t need a team of compliance \\\\nofficers to simply be competitive, just to name a few.\\\\n    In closing, I would like to thank our Members for bringing \\\\nthese bills forward for consideration in today&#x27;s markup. Every \\\\npiece of legislation we are going to look at today is a product \\\\nof hearings and investigations we have conducted. I am \\\\nextremely proud to see how our committee is generating sound \\\\nand responsible legislation that will make main street \\\\nstronger.\\\\n    With that I look forward to today&#x27;s markup. I yield to the \\\\ndistinguished Ranking Member from the great state of New York, \\\\nMs. Velazquez.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for \\\\nholding this markup today. We are considering seven bills to \\\\nmake improvements to SBA programs and services from focusing on \\\\nrural disaster and disabled communities to improving the SBIC \\\\nprogram and contracting rules.\\\\n    We have a strong slate of bills before us. Main street \\\\nsmall businesses are the life blood of our nation&#x27;s economy \\\\ndriving innovation and job creation and helping millions of \\\\nAmericans achieve the American Dream. I stand committed to \\\\ncreating more opportunities for entrepreneurs so that they \\\\ncontinue to thrive and in turn create good-paying jobs in our \\\\nlocal communities.\\\\n    I plan to lend my support to the seven bipartisan bills we \\\\nare considering today. My hope is that we will work together to \\\\nbring a fair ratio of Republican and Democratic bills to the \\\\nfloor in the near future. Thank you, Mr. Williams, and I look \\\\nforward to a productive markup.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Thank you. And does any other Member seek \\\\nrecognition for the purpose of making an opening statement? \\\\nSeeing none, we will now move to the consideration of the first \\\\nbill.\\\\n    H.R. 7984\\\\n    The first bill we will mark up is H.R. 7984, the Rural \\\\nSmall Business Resilience Act, introduced by Representatives \\\\nPappas and Bean. I now recognize the bill&#x27;s sponsor, Mr. Pappas \\\\nfor an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. PAPPAS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. In New \\\\nHampshire, our small businesses are part of the backbone of our \\\\nlocal economies and make up the fabric of our rural \\\\ncommunities, and we know that rural small businesses face \\\\nunique challenges that a one-size-fits-all approach by \\\\ngovernment agencies is simply ineffective at providing the \\\\nsupport that they need.\\\\n    That is why I introduced the Rural Small Business \\\\nResilience Act. The bipartisan legislation would require the \\\\nSmall Business Administration to tailor its outreach and \\\\nmarketing efforts to reach our rural small businesses and \\\\nensure that small businesses in rural areas have full access to \\\\nSBA disaster assistance.\\\\n    I am glad to be working with Representatives Bean, Golden, \\\\nand Mann on this issue, and will continue to work in a \\\\nbipartisan fashion to build support for this and other \\\\nlegislation that will help America&#x27;s small businesses.\\\\n    I remain committed to ensuring that rural small businesses \\\\nand our local economies can grow and thrive and I urge my \\\\ncolleagues to support this bill.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. I now recognize the bill&#x27;s cosponsor, Mr. \\\\nBean, for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Very good morning, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so \\\\nmuch. Good morning, Committee, and good morning those attending \\\\nSmall Business this morning. We are glad to have you here. \\\\nWelcome to your nation&#x27;s capital.\\\\n    I am pleased to co-lead H.R. 7984, the Rural Small Business \\\\nResilience Act, along with my new good friend, Representative \\\\nPappas from the great state of New Hampshire, also known as the \\\\nGranite State. This legislation will require the SBA to \\\\nappropriately tailor marketing and outreach materials to rural \\\\ncommunities following a disaster.\\\\n    We all know the challenges facing America&#x27;s rural \\\\ncommunities following a disaster are different than those in \\\\nurban areas and often are unique in their needs that go unmet. \\\\nNatural disasters are all too common in the free state of \\\\nFlorida. We would still welcome you there if you want to come \\\\nstay or come vacation, where the yearly threat of hurricanes is \\\\ntop of mind for small business owners.\\\\n    In February of this year, the Government Accountability \\\\nOffice, the GAO, issued a report on how targeted outreach from \\\\nthe SBA can benefit rural communities. The GAO found that \\\\npeople in rural areas may not be aware of the assistance the \\\\nSBA can provide following a disaster.\\\\n    The GAO recommends the SBA distinguish between rural and \\\\nurban communities and their outreach and marketing programs \\\\nfollowing a disaster. Thankfully, Mr. Pappas and I have heard \\\\nthat message loud and clear from the GAO and we think we have \\\\nthe answer to help rural small businesses get the answer that \\\\nthey are looking for.\\\\n    The answer is, and I have it, it is the Rural Small \\\\nBusiness Resilience Act. And I look forward, Members, to \\\\nworking with you and working with Representative Pappas on the \\\\npassage of this commonsense bipartisan bill and urge colleagues \\\\nto join us, join our team to make this happen.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, does everybody know you were up at 5:00 for \\\\nbaseball this morning and yet you are here today to serve the \\\\nneeds of small businesses across America? Thank you for your \\\\nleadership, and I yield back the balance of my time.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Thank you for those remarks. Are there any \\\\nother Members who wish to be recognized for a statement on the \\\\nbill?\\\\n    Okay. If there are no other Members--I am sorry. Once all \\\\nMembers--you--the Chairman--Ranking Member, will you speak on \\\\nthis bill?\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Are you recognizing me?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. I am recognizing you, Madam Chair.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I commend Mr. \\\\nPappas, Mr. Bean, Mr. Golden, and Mr. Mann for their bipartisan \\\\neffort to bring H.R. 7984 before the committee today.\\\\n    The Government Accountability Office provides Congress with \\\\nfact-based, nonpartisan information to improve government \\\\nprograms and save taxpayers dollars. In February GAO issued a \\\\nreport that examined SBA disaster loan program and challenges \\\\nrural communities face.\\\\n    GAO found that rural communities have unique obstacles \\\\nmaking it harder to recover after a disaster such as a lack of \\\\ninfrastructure, human resources, and funding. While SBA has \\\\ntaken steps to better meet the needs of disaster survivors, GAO \\\\nfound a more targeted approach is needed in rural areas.\\\\n    This legislation would go a long way in signaling to SBA \\\\nthat strengthening outreach to rural communities is a priority.\\\\n    I commend Mr. Pappas, Mr. Bean, Mr. Golden, and Mr. Mann \\\\nfor their leadership, and I yield back. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back. And I want to now \\\\nrecognize myself to speak in support of this legislation.\\\\n    H.R. 7984, the Rural Small Business Resilience Act, will \\\\nrequire the SBA to meet communities where they are following a \\\\ndisaster. And there is no secret that Americans in rural \\\\ncommunities face different challenges following a disaster than \\\\ntheir urban counterparts.\\\\n    It makes sense then that a one-size-fits-all outreach and \\\\nmarketing plan from the SBA is inadequate. The GAO confirmed \\\\nthis in their February 2024 report stating that oftentimes \\\\nindividuals in rural areas do not even know assistance is \\\\navailable from the SBA as they try to get back on their feet \\\\nfollowing a disaster.\\\\n    The SBA&#x27;s disaster loan program offers loans to help \\\\nhomeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofits recover from \\\\nphysical and economic losses following a declared disaster.\\\\n    And I am grateful to Representatives Pappas and Bean for \\\\nintroducing this legislation so that rural Americans will have \\\\nfull access to their resources when disaster strikes and I urge \\\\nmy colleagues to support this bill.\\\\n    If there is no further discussion, the committee now moved \\\\nto consider of H.R. 7984.\\\\n    The clerk will report.\\\\n    The CLERK. H.R. 7984, to require the administration----\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS.

Do any Members \\\\nseek recognition for the purpose of offering an amendment?\\\\n    Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 7984 \\\\nand favorably reporting it to the House.\\\\n    All those in favor, say aye.\\\\n    All those opposed, say no.\\\\n    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and H.R. 7984 \\\\nis agreed to be reported favorably to the House.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Mr. Chairman?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. What do you seek recognition for?\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I seek to request a \\\\nrecorded vote.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Okay. A recorded voted has been requested and \\\\na roll call vote is ordered pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and \\\\nHouse rule XI. Further proceedings on the bill are postponed.\\\\n    H.R. 5333\\\\n    The next bill we will markup is H.R. 5333, the Investing in \\\\nAll of America Act of 2023, introduced by Representatives \\\\nMeuser and Scholten.

The amendment has been pre-\\\\ndistributed to all Members and the clerk will report the \\\\namendment.\\\\n    The CLERK. Amendment in the nature of a substitute to \\\\nH.R.----\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Without objection, the amendment is \\\\nconsidered as read and the substitute will be considered base \\\\ntext of the bill for the purpose of amendment.\\\\n    I now recognize the bill&#x27;s sponsor, Mr. Meuser, for his \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Small business investment companies, SBICs, are privately \\\\nowned companies that are licensed and regulated by the SBA. \\\\nSBICs raise private capital by the Small Business \\\\nAdministration and it is matched with leverage by the SBA. \\\\nSBICs then deploy these private funds along with the SBA \\\\nguaranteed funding to invest directly in small businesses.\\\\n    The SBIC program operates at a zero-subsidy cost to the \\\\nAmerican taxpayer. In other words, taxpayer funds are not \\\\nutilized to support credit extended to SBIC investments. SBIC-\\\\nbacked businesses have created over 3 million new jobs and \\\\nsupported an additional 10.5 million jobs over just the last \\\\ntwo decades.\\\\n    Last year alone SBICs invested over $8 billion in small \\\\nbusinesses across America, including $412 million in my home \\\\nstate of Pennsylvania to small business. Now, the SBIC program \\\\nhas been very successful in responsibly deploying capital to \\\\nsmall businesses. Recent studies have shown that less than 20 \\\\npercent of SBIC investment reaches low- to middle-income \\\\ncommunities.\\\\n    So, H.R. 5333, the Investing in All of America Act, which I \\\\nintroduced with Representative Scholten, would incentive the \\\\ndeployment of additional capital to small business located in \\\\nrural or low-income areas as well as small businesses in the \\\\nnational security technology sectors. Dollars invested in these \\\\nareas will not count against individual SBIC&#x27;s leveraged cap.\\\\n    By creating this incentive, the Investing in All of America \\\\nAct will encourage private capital investment in the parts of \\\\nAmerica that are, in fact, often overlooked. It is important to \\\\nnote that the bonus leverage included in this legislation does \\\\nnot change the cost or risks of the SBIC program.\\\\n    The existing successful private capital ratio to SBA \\\\nleverage that has kept the program operating so well and at no \\\\nsubsidy will remain the same. This legislation would also \\\\nadjust the SBIC leverage caps to account for inflation. SBIC \\\\nleverage caps have not been adjusted since 2015, for single \\\\nlicenses in 2018 for a family of funds. Since the last \\\\nadjustments inflation has risen nearly 30 percent.\\\\n    So, as we continue to deal with increasing inflation, \\\\nreinstating the inflation adjustor for the leverage cap is \\\\nessential to ensure the investment power of SBICs remain \\\\nconsistent with the broader markets and ensure the program can \\\\ncontinue to provide small business with the capital they need.\\\\n    Just yesterday the Subcommittee on Economic Growth Tax and \\\\nCapital Access, which I Chair, held a hearing examining the \\\\nSBIC program. In addition to discussing the positive effects of \\\\nthe program, we did discuss improvements that could be made. I \\\\nam happy to say that a number of the reforms suggested by our \\\\nwitnesses are included in this legislation.\\\\n    While there is more work to do, this legislation will make \\\\na positive impact on those participating in the SBIC programs \\\\nand assist them deploying even more capital to worthy small \\\\nbusinesses, especially, again, those who are often overlooked.\\\\n    Now, before I conclude I would ask, Mr. Chairman, for \\\\nunanimous consent to insert a letter into the record from \\\\nnearly 100 small business investment companies in support of \\\\nthis legislation.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Granted.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I would like to thank Representative Scholten \\\\nfor her partnership on this legislation and bipartisan group of \\\\n14 Members who have cosponsored it. I would also like to thank \\\\nChairman Williams for bringing this bill forward for the \\\\nconsideration today.\\\\n    I look forward to continued working with my colleagues to \\\\nensure the SBA&#x27;s programs, like the SBICs, are serving as small \\\\nbusiness as well and responsibly deploying capital to areas \\\\nwhere it is most needed.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize the bill&#x27;s cosponsor, Ms. Scholten, for a \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Thank you so much to the bill&#x27;s leader, Mr. \\\\nMeuser, and to Chairman Williams for bringing this bill before \\\\ncommittee. This is what I came to Congress to do, these types \\\\nof bipartisan, commonsense solutions that help Main Street \\\\nAmerica and rural parts of our community that are often \\\\noverlooked.\\\\n    Michigan is home to almost 1 million small businesses. That \\\\nis 99.6 percent of all privately owned businesses in the state. \\\\nThis bill is going to have a huge impact. On any given day, the \\\\nissue of access to capital is among the greatest challenge for \\\\nour small businesses. For low-, middle-income and rural \\\\ncommunities this issue hits even closer to home.\\\\n    Recent studies have show that less than 20 percent of small \\\\nbusiness investment companies, SBIC funds are reaching these \\\\ncommunities. That is insane. For a program with a long history \\\\nof success, this disparity is completely unacceptable and it is \\\\nincumbent upon this committee the program so that it serves \\\\nsmall business owned by people from all walks of life.\\\\n    That is exactly what we are doing here today. That is why I \\\\nam so proud to lead the Investing in All of America Act, which \\\\nwould not only incentivize the deployment of additional capital \\\\nto underserved communities by not counting dollars invested in \\\\nrural or low-income areas or in the national security \\\\ntechnology sector against the SBICs&#x27; leverage count.\\\\n    This bipartisan solution would bolster SBIC program success \\\\nas a zero subsidy, pubic-private partnership by encouraging \\\\ninvestments in rural areas in industries that are vital to \\\\nnational defense here in West Michigan and across the country.\\\\n    It is critical that these businesses can get the \\\\ninvestments that they need to continue growing our economy \\\\nespecially those in underserved and rural communities. I \\\\nstrongly urge Members to vote on this bipartisan and important \\\\nlegislation.\\\\n    Thank you again to the bill&#x27;s cosponsor, Mr. Meuser, and to \\\\nthe Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time, sir.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    Are there any other Members who wish to recognized for a \\\\nstatement on the bill?\\\\n    Okay. If there are no Members who wish to be recognized, I \\\\nwould like to recognize the Ranking Member to speak on the \\\\nbill.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to \\\\nRepresentatives Meuser and Scholten for your bipartisan \\\\nleadership on this bill. H.R. 5333 makes statutory improvements \\\\nto the SBAC program to provide access to additional leverage \\\\nwhen they invest in small businesses in rural or underserved \\\\ncommunities, or small business critical to national security.\\\\n    Due to the capital-intensive nature and early revenue \\\\nprofile small firms operating in America&#x27;s critical technology \\\\nsector need institutional investors with longer term time \\\\nhorizons to raise capital. Yet, due to statutory constraints \\\\nthese investors are often limited in their ability to \\\\nparticipate in the SBIC program, making the program an \\\\nunsuitable option for critical technology to raise capital.\\\\n    By providing SBICs with additional leverage flexibility, \\\\nthis bill will enable the SBA and Defense Department to \\\\nsuccessfully carry out their joint small business investment \\\\ncompany critical technology initiative. By providing SBICs with \\\\nadditional bonus leverage, we are encouraging investment in \\\\nsmall employers in our communities that need it most.\\\\n    I again want to thank Representatives Meuser and Scholten \\\\nfor their leadership on this issue. I also want to thank \\\\nChairman Williams and his team for their collaboration on \\\\ntechnical edits to the bill and the team at the SBA for their \\\\nfeedback.\\\\n    I believe through the effort of all parties involved we \\\\nhave got in this bill to a good place. I am proud to support it \\\\nand encourage Members to vote yes.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back. And I now \\\\nrecognize myself to speak in support of this legislation.\\\\n    Small business are faced with continual disadvantages when \\\\nit comes to assessing capital whether it&#x27;s burdensome \\\\nregulations and high interest rates, banks are being forced to \\\\ntighten their lending standards.\\\\n    When this happens, small businesses are often the ones \\\\nforced to pay the higher price to much needed funds. This is \\\\nwhere the SBA&#x27;s SBIC program comes into help. This program \\\\nexpands the options available to our nation&#x27;s job creators to \\\\nassess vital funding to grow and expand their operations.\\\\n    And H.R. 5333 makes the thoughtful improvements to ensure \\\\nthat the SBIC program continues to be an essential part of \\\\nhelping many small businesses navigate these economic \\\\nchallenges and increase the avenues to access capital. The bill \\\\nallows the SBIC license commitment to account for inflation and \\\\nprovides additional leverage to licensees when committing to \\\\ninvest in smaller enterprises in underserved areas, \\\\nspecifically in rural America and areas of critical national \\\\ndefense technologies.\\\\n    Additionally, the bill directs no new spending and no new \\\\nmandates allowing the program to continue operating at no cost \\\\nto the taxpayer. Just yesterday in a subcommittee hearing we \\\\nheard about the benefits this bill will have on program \\\\nparticipants. The bill will make meaningful changes to the SBIC \\\\nprogram all without adding additional risk for the taxpayers.\\\\n    I urge my colleagues to vote yes, on both the amendment and \\\\nthe nature of substitute on H.R. 5333 and the underlying bill.\\\\n    So, do any Members seek recognition of the purpose of \\\\noffering the amendment to the amendment in the nature of a \\\\nsubstitute? If there is no further discussion, on the question \\\\nnow on the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. \\\\n5333, offered by Mr. Meuser.\\\\n    All those in favor, say aye.\\\\n    All those opposed, say no.\\\\n    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The \\\\namendment and the nature of the substitute H.R. 5333 offered by \\\\nMr. Meuser is agreed to.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Chairman?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes, sir?\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I would like to request a recorded vote.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. A recorded vote----\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I withdraw my request.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Request is withdrawn. Okay. The question now \\\\nis now on favorably reporting H.R. 5333 as amended to the \\\\nHouse. Okay.\\\\n    All those in favor, say aye.\\\\n    Opposed?\\\\n    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and H.R. \\\\n5333, as amended, is agreed to in order to favorably move to \\\\nthe House.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Chairman?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes, sir?\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I would now like to request a recorded vote.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. For what purpose does the gentleman seek \\\\nrecognition for a recorded vote?\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Yes, sir, for a recorded vote. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested and a roll \\\\ncall is ordered. Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and House rule \\\\nXI further proceedings on the bill is postponed.\\\\n    All right.\\\\n    H.R. 8014\\\\n    The next bill we will markup is H.R. 8014, the Transparency \\\\nand Predictability in Small Business Opportunities Act, \\\\nintroduced by Representatives Mfume and Alford. I now recognize \\\\nthe bill&#x27;s sponsor. Mr. Mfume is not here I don&#x27;t think. Is he? \\\\nOkay. All right. All right.\\\\n    I now recognize the bill&#x27;s cosponsor, Mr. Alford for an \\\\nopening statement.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you so much, \\\\nRanking Member Velazquez, for holding this markup session \\\\ntoday. I tell you what, I love coming to these sessions. It is \\\\na culmination of hard work, determination, and grit, and we are \\\\ngetting back to doing the business for Main Street America and \\\\nI love that.\\\\n    This committee really exists in Congress to champion main \\\\nstreet, to make sure that small businesses that employ about \\\\nhalf of all Americans continue to thrive. Our role is to help \\\\nlower the barriers to creating small businesses and to support \\\\nsmall businesses that already exist. A major tool to help \\\\nexisting small businesses are government contracts specifically \\\\nset aside for small businesses.\\\\n    However, federal agencies cancel contracts solicitations \\\\nmany times with no warning and no reason, leaving the small \\\\nbusinesses that spent thousands or tens of thousands of dollars \\\\nand hours preparing a bid, leaving them out in the cold.\\\\n    This bill, the Transparency and Predictability in Small \\\\nBusiness Opportunities Act, would help address this problem, \\\\nhelp solve it, help end it. This legislation would require \\\\nagencies to provide the Small Business Administration a \\\\njustification for canceled contract solicitations. \\\\nAdditionally, this would require the agency canceling the \\\\ncontract solicitations to disclose available information about \\\\nplans to reissue similar solicitations.\\\\n    Finally, if the agency does not plan on reissuing a \\\\nsolicitation, the agency&#x27;s director of small and disadvantaged \\\\nbusiness utilization must assist the small business in \\\\nidentifying similar contracting opportunities. Basically, Mr. \\\\nChairman and Ranking Member, this is setting up people for \\\\nsuccess and breaking down barriers in the process.\\\\n    I am proud to support this legislation, proud to be on this \\\\nwith Mr. Mfume. It is going to help provide stability and \\\\npredictability to small business contractors, part of our \\\\nresponsibility on this committee.\\\\n    Thank you and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back. Are there any \\\\nother Members who wish to recognized for a statement on the \\\\nbill?\\\\n    Okay. If there are no other Members who wish to be \\\\nrecognized, I would like to recognize the Ranking Member to \\\\nspeak on the bill.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I commend \\\\nRepresentatives Mfume and Alford for their work on this \\\\nlegislation which will require the government to provide \\\\ninformation to small business contractors when they cancel \\\\nsolicitations.\\\\n    The government has flexibility to change requirements and \\\\nsolicitations as needed when their circumstances change. While \\\\nthis flexibility is necessary, the small businesses take on the \\\\nrisk and can incur losses when it happens. We have heard and \\\\ntime and again the barriers facing small contractors in our \\\\nindustrial base.\\\\n    The Women&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce has complained how numerous \\\\nsmall business contracts just go away without explanation or \\\\ndiscussion of the obstacles. And during our hearing on February \\\\n6th, Andrew Christ, a small business owner highlighted how \\\\nsmall firms can spend significant amounts, an average of \\\\n$10,000 to develop a proposal, only to find out that the \\\\nproject has become inactive.\\\\n    The bill we are considering today would not limit an \\\\nagency&#x27;s ability to make changes when necessary. It will simply \\\\nprovide some help to the small business when it does, requiring \\\\nan agency to disclose the reasons behind a cancellation and any \\\\nplans for the work will provide small contractors with a little \\\\nmore information to adjust their business plans and operations \\\\naccordingly.\\\\n    I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I yield back, \\\\nMr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize myself to speak in support of this \\\\nlegislation. H.R. 8014, the Transparency and Predictability in \\\\nSmall Business Opportunities Act, seeks to bring clarity to \\\\nsmall business owners when an agency cancels a contract \\\\nsolicitation.\\\\n    Small business spend an incredible amount of time and \\\\nresources preparing to bid on government contracts. When an \\\\nagency cancels a contract solicitation the small businesses \\\\nthat started preparing are left with nothing to show for their \\\\nwork.\\\\n    Furthermore, there is little clarity about what the agency \\\\nwill do with the products and services originally intended to \\\\npurchase. So, H.R. 8014 will require the agency to share with \\\\nthe SBA justifications why the contract was cancelled. \\\\nMoreover, this bill requires agencies to assist small \\\\nbusinesses impacted by the canceled solicitation by helping \\\\nthem identify similar contracts to bid on.\\\\n    Small businesses deserve to have a full understanding of \\\\nwhat opportunities are available to them and to know how \\\\nagencies will fulfill their buying needs. So, I urge all my \\\\ncolleagues to support H.R. 8014.\\\\n    If there is no further discussion, the committee now moves \\\\nto consideration of H.R. 8014.\\\\n    The clerk will report.\\\\n    The CLERK. H.R. 8014, to require the----\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Without objection, the first reading of the \\\\nbill is dispensed and, without objection, the bill is \\\\nconsidered as read and open for amendment.\\\\n    Do any Members seek recognition for the purpose of offering \\\\nan amendment?\\\\n    Seeing none, the question is that now on adoption of H.R. \\\\n8014 and favorably reporting to the House.\\\\n    All those in favor, say aye.\\\\n    All those opposed, say no.\\\\n    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and H.R. 8014 \\\\nis agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Mr. Chairman?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. What recognition do you seek?\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. I seek to have recorded votes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. A record of votes has been requested and a \\\\nroll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to committee rule 13 and \\\\nHouse rule XI, further proceedings on the bill are postponed.\\\\n    H.R. 7987\\\\n    The next bill we will markup is H.R. 7987, the Plain \\\\nLanguage in Contracting Act, introduced by Representatives \\\\nLaLota and Thanedar. I recognize the bill&#x27;s sponsor, Mr. LaLota \\\\nfor an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman, it shouldn&#x27;t be as hard as the federal government \\\\nmakes it for America&#x27;s small businesses to apply for an to win \\\\na federal contract. Small business, who are the life blood of \\\\nAmerica&#x27;s economy and often have a single-digit or a low \\\\ndouble-digit number of employees, shouldn&#x27;t require a lawyer or \\\\ncompliance office to compete for and ultimately win a federal \\\\ncontract. But we have a solution.\\\\n    My bill, and a shout-out to my cosponsor and Representative \\\\nThanedar, the Plain Language in Contracting Act, would help \\\\nsolve that problem by making it easier for small businesses to \\\\nsecure government contracts.\\\\n    There are over 33 million small businesses in America, 33 \\\\nmillion. And many of these companies offer products and \\\\nservices that are crucial for the procurement of key projects \\\\nboth here in the United States and abroad. However, of those 33 \\\\nmillion only about 65,000 of those small businesses actually \\\\nwin federal prime contracts. That is a terrible ratio.\\\\n    We have heard from many small business owners who say that \\\\ncomplexity of the bidding process for a government contract \\\\nultimately turns them away. Preparing for that bid is difficult \\\\nenough, but the process is made even more difficult when the \\\\ngovernment is ambiguous about what it wants and its language is \\\\nso complex that understanding it requires an advance degree.\\\\n    I challenge everyone of you, both Members, audience, and \\\\nfolks at home to try to understand some of these contract \\\\nrequirements. I know that it is frustrating for me and it is \\\\nabsolutely ridiculous. It takes an advanced law degree to make \\\\nsense of it and even a lot of folks with those degrees can&#x27;t \\\\nmake that sense.\\\\n    In fact, a naval postgraduate school commissioned a study \\\\nof over 1 million DOD solicitations and they found three key \\\\nthings. Less than 3 percent of DOD contract solicitations are \\\\nwritten in plain English. Second, most DOD solicitations \\\\nrequire a college education just to understand it. And third \\\\nand final, on a standard readability scale most DOD contracts \\\\nare either difficult or very difficult to read on their rating \\\\nscale.\\\\n    The detrimental effect of our government&#x27;s convoluted \\\\nlanguage on small businesses cannot be overstated. It is a \\\\ndirect cause of small businesses&#x27; exodus from federal \\\\ncontracting leading to a significant loss in competition. And \\\\nlet me be clear, the competition lost by reduced small business \\\\nhurts all of us, especially on the pricing and the quality. \\\\nSmall businesses are the backbone of our great nation&#x27;s economy \\\\nand we should be doing everything we can to support them.\\\\n    That is why I am proud I have introduced my bill, the Plain \\\\nLanguage in Contracting Act, which will require federal \\\\nagencies to use clear language when publishing contact \\\\nsolicitations, finally allowing greater access to solicitations \\\\nbids.\\\\n    I urge all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \\\\nsupport this commonsense bill. Again, one more shout-out to my \\\\ncolleague, Representative Thanedar, with whom I also serve on \\\\nthe Homeland Security Committee for his co-lead on this, and, \\\\nChairman Williams, for you and your staff, for your diligence \\\\non this.\\\\n    This could be my fourth bill that gets to the House floor \\\\nand appreciate it, sir. I yield.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    And I recognize the bill&#x27;s co-sponsor, Mr. Thanedar, for an \\\\nopening statement.\\\\n    Mr. THANEDAR. Thank you, Chairman Williams and Ranking \\\\nMember Velazquez. I appreciate both of you and your leadership \\\\nin this bipartisan effort. What a great work. This is really \\\\nwhat I came to Congress to do. As an entrepreneur I am \\\\ndelighted with what this committee does and the collaboration \\\\nwith both sides.\\\\n    Today, alongside my esteemed colleague, Representative \\\\nLaLota from New York, I am proud to co-lead the Plain Language \\\\nin Contracting Act, a bipartisan initiative aimed at \\\\nrevolutionizing how government communicates with small \\\\nbusinesses.\\\\n    As a co-lead on this vital legislation, I am deeply \\\\ncommitted to simply find the often convoluted and inaccessible \\\\nnotices that hinder small businesses&#x27; access to government \\\\ncontracts.\\\\n    Having experienced the challenges of entrepreneurship \\\\nfirsthand, Representative LaLota and I recognize the urgent \\\\nneed to cut through bureaucratic jargon and provide clear, \\\\nconcise, and accessible information to our nation&#x27;s small \\\\nbusiness owners. This bill not only aligns with our core values \\\\nof transparency and efficiency but also reflects our unwavering \\\\ndedication to fostering a level playing field for all \\\\nbusinesses regardless of size.\\\\n    By requiring the inclusion of key words and adherence to \\\\nfederal plain language guidelines we are not just drafting \\\\nlegislation, we are empowering small businesses to navigate the \\\\ncomplexity of government contracting with confidence and ease. \\\\nThis is about just--is this about more than just policy. It is \\\\nabout supporting the backbone of our economy and ensuring that \\\\nevery entrepreneur has the opportunity to succeed.\\\\n    I am proud to stand alongside Representative LaLota and our \\\\ncolleagues in this bipartisan effort and I look forward to \\\\nworking tirelessly to advance this critical legislation for the \\\\nbetterment of our small business community and our nation as a \\\\nwhole.\\\\n    Thank you, Representative LaLota, and thank you all, and I \\\\nyield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a \\\\nstatement on this bill? If there are no other Members to be \\\\nrecognized, I would like to recognize the Ranking Member to \\\\nspeak on the bill.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the \\\\nwork done on this legislation that seeks to provide clarity for \\\\nsome small business government contractors working or looking \\\\nto work with the federal government. It would require certain \\\\ncontracting documents, including requests for proposals and \\\\nsolicitations be written in a way that is clear, concise, and \\\\naccessible.\\\\n    The goals of this bill are laudable. There are certainly \\\\nways in which the federal government can improve in this area \\\\nin the language used and on contracting opportunities is one. \\\\nThanks to our sponsor for their work.\\\\n    Thank you again and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back. And I now \\\\nrecognize myself to speak in support of this legislation.\\\\n    H.R. 7987, the Plain Language in Contracting Act, is a very \\\\nimportant piece of legislation which removes a hurdle small \\\\nbusinesses face as they consider doing business with the \\\\ngovernment.\\\\n    The complexity of government contracting often turns small \\\\nbusinesses away from even attempting to compete for these \\\\nawards. The government-speak used in federal contracting only \\\\nadds confusion to small businesses and often takes a team of \\\\nattorneys to fully comprehend what they mean or services that \\\\nare being requested and government language is so problematic \\\\nthat the committee has heard firsthand testimony from small \\\\nbusiness owners about the challenges of navigating government \\\\nlanguage.\\\\n    In a subcommittee hearing we held just yesterday we heard \\\\nthat most DOD solicitations require at least some higher \\\\neducation to understand what is written. This burden is just \\\\none of the many reasons that small businesses&#x27; participation in \\\\nthe industrial base has been cut by nearly one-half over the \\\\npast decade.\\\\n    The Plain Language in Contracting Act makes it easier for \\\\nsmall businesses to federal contracting to navigate these \\\\nunnecessarily complex documents by finally requiring agencies \\\\nto write concisely. I want to thank the Ranking Member and her \\\\nstaff and her team for working with us in drafting this bill \\\\nand I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Plain Language \\\\nin Contracting Act.\\\\n    If there is no further discussion, the committee now moved \\\\nto consideration of H.R. 7987.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Mr. Chairman?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The clerk will report.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Chairman?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Disregard, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. What you would----\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Disregard my comment, Mr. Chairman. I pulled a \\\\nMeuser, sorry.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. We good? We can--do you want us to take a \\\\nrecess and we will----\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. No, sir. No, sir.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Okay. Here we go.

Without objection, the first reading of the \\\\nbill is dispensed and, without objection, the bill is \\\\nconsidered as read and open for amendment. Do any Members seek \\\\nrecognition for the purpose of offering an amendment?\\\\n    If no, seeing none, the question is now on the adoption of \\\\nH.R. 7987 and favorably reporting it to the House.\\\\n    All those in favor, say aye.\\\\n    All those opposed, say no.\\\\n    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and H.R. \\\\n7987----\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Mr. Chairman?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Seek recognition.\\\\n    Mr. LALOTA. Mr. Chairman, I request a role call vote.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Okay. The Member asked for a recorded vote. A \\\\nrecorded vote has been requested and roll call vote is order. \\\\nPursuant to committee rule 13 and House rule XI, further \\\\nproceedings on this bill----\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chair?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS.--are postponed.\\\\n    H.R. 7988\\\\n    The next bill we will--Gluesenkamp Perez. I now recognize \\\\nthe bill&#x27;s sponsor, Mr. Stauber, for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I rise to \\\\nspeak in favor of my bill, H.R. 7988, the Small Business \\\\nProcurement and Utilization Reform Act of 2024, or the SPUR \\\\nAct.\\\\n    Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They are \\\\nthe innovators, the job traders, and the driving force behind \\\\neconomic growth. In Minnesota, small businesses account for \\\\nover 99 percent of all businesses and employ over half of the \\\\nworkforce.\\\\n    It is no exaggeration to say that the success of our \\\\neconomy is tied to the success of our small businesses. I \\\\nbelieve there is no better way for the government to support \\\\nsmall businesses than to ensure they have ever opportunity to \\\\ncontract with the largest purchaser of goods and services in \\\\nthe world, the federal government.\\\\n    The problem is that while government agencies set aside \\\\ncontract opportunities for small businesses participation in \\\\nfederal contracting has declined by half in the last decade. We \\\\nhave an existing system in place that helps us see that we need \\\\nto improve.\\\\n    Agencies are graded on the total number and value of small \\\\nbusiness contracts, yet they do not factor in small businesses \\\\nwho won a federal contract for the first time. So, without \\\\nincorporating this into the agency&#x27;s scoreboard grade, we have \\\\nno ability to tell whether the shrinking pool of small \\\\nbusinesses are first time contractors or have been contracting \\\\nfor multiple years.\\\\n    My bill, the SPUR Act, addresses this concern. It will \\\\nprovide us with more information to see where the federal \\\\ngovernment can improve. I would like to thank my colleague from \\\\nWashington, Representative Gluesenkamp Perez, for her support \\\\nof this important legislation.\\\\n    Too many federal agencies fall short of their goals for \\\\nawarding contracts to small businesses leaving billions of \\\\ndollars in contracts out of reach of America&#x27;s small \\\\nbusinesses. And I urge my colleagues to support this \\\\nlegislation as it will help ensure that the federal government \\\\nis doing everything it can to support small businesses in \\\\nAmerica.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize \\\\nthe bill&#x27;s cosponsor, Ms. Gluesenkamp Perez, for an opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you, Chairman Williams, and \\\\nthank you to my colleague, Mr. Stauber, for his partnership on \\\\nthis bill and your valiant efforts at pronouncing my last name.\\\\n    The SBA is tasked with ensuring that small businesses are \\\\ngiven a fair shot at competing for federal contracting dollars. \\\\nSBA publishes an annual small business procurement scorecard \\\\nthat grades each federal agency on their spending towards the \\\\ngoal and gives agencies a score for their performance. We all \\\\nknow the adage there is lies, damn lies, and statistics. And I \\\\nam certainly not accusing anyone of lying here, but I think it \\\\nis important that when we are looking at these numbers we are \\\\nunderstanding what they are representing.\\\\n    Put simply the federal government is not retaining current \\\\nsmall business government contractors and new small businesses \\\\nare not choosing to enter the federal market. This is a big \\\\nproblem.\\\\n    For our local economies to thrive it is important that we \\\\nlevel the playing field, ensure more Southwest Washington small \\\\nbusinesses can benefit from these opportunities. Our bill would \\\\nrequire that the SBA include the number of new entrants into \\\\nthe federal market and the methodology for scoring each federal \\\\nagency&#x27;s small business performance.\\\\n    After the pandemic hit in 2020, my husband and I spent the \\\\nbetter part of the year working on upgrades to the \\\\ninfrastructure in our auto shop, like better ventilation, \\\\nlighting, things that would keep our employees and customers \\\\nsafe.\\\\n    Our good friends who own an autobody shop spent the entire \\\\nyear trying to figure out how to navigate a contract with the \\\\nCity of Portland. To me this is a really good example of how it \\\\nis a real loss to our workforce and our local economy when \\\\nsmall business owners have to spend the whole year figuring out \\\\nhow to do business with the government.\\\\n    Our bill will help shed light on how successful federal \\\\nagencies are at making sure that new businesses see the value \\\\nin contracting with the federal government and have the \\\\ncapacity to overcome the regulatory burdens to tap into these \\\\nresources.\\\\n    I am proud to co-lead this bill with Representative Stauber \\\\nand I urge my colleagues on the committee to support it. Thank \\\\nyou and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back. Are there any \\\\nother Members who wish to be recognized for a statement on the \\\\nbill?\\\\n    If there are no other Members who wish to be recognized, I \\\\nwould like to recognize the Ranking Member to speak on the \\\\nbill.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I commend \\\\nRepresentatives Stauber and Gluesenkamp Perez for the work to \\\\nrequire SBA to consider new small business contractors when \\\\ngrading a federal agency performance toward meeting its small \\\\nbusinesses goals.\\\\n    The government has roughly 40 percent fewer small \\\\nbusinesses in its ecosystem then it did just a decade ago. This \\\\ndecline of the industrial base has produced negative \\\\nconsequences for both the government and small firms and \\\\ntaxpayers. They lose out on the stability government \\\\ncontracting can provide and the government loses out on the \\\\ninnovation and competition that a larger small based of small \\\\nbusinesses provides.\\\\n    Yet despite this decline, federal agencies award a record \\\\namount of contracting dollars to small businesses each year. \\\\nThis means fewer small businesses are getting larger contracts. \\\\nAnd since contracts are getting larger, fewer small businesses \\\\nare willing and able to compete for them. This legislation is a \\\\nproductive step that will help break that cycle.\\\\n    By requiring a year-over-year comparison of new entrants \\\\nrather than a single target, federal agencies will be compelled \\\\nto continuously focus on bringing in new companies and \\\\naddressing the barriers, like contract size, that prevent \\\\ngreater small business participation.\\\\n    I again applaud the work put into this legislation. It is a \\\\nthoughtful product that I am pleased to support and I urge my \\\\ncolleagues to support as well.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    And I now recognize myself to speak in support of this \\\\nlegislation.\\\\n    H.R. 7988 makes it clear that small businesses are vital in \\\\nthe American industrial base. Each year agencies set a goal to \\\\nspend at least 23 percent of their contract dollars with main \\\\nstreet. The government generally meets this goal in dollars, \\\\nbut the number of small businesses actually winning contracts \\\\ncontinues to decline and agencies are prioritizing the total \\\\ndollars it awards, not the number of small firms.\\\\n    The decline in participation that we are seeing is a \\\\ncritical threat to America&#x27;s industrial base and we must take \\\\naction to reverse this trend. That is why the SPUR Act is \\\\ncritical. It will force agencies to factor in small businesses \\\\nwho won a government contract for the first time when they are \\\\ngraded on SBA&#x27;s annual procurement scorecard.\\\\n    As agencies plan out their contracting activities they must \\\\nensure that increasing small businesses awards is a priority so \\\\nthat they have every opportunity to compete for these \\\\ncontracts. So, I urge all my colleagues to support the SPUR \\\\nAct.\\\\n    And if there is no further discussion, the committee now \\\\nmoves to consideration of H.R. 7988. The clerk will report.\\\\n    The CLERK. H.R. 7988----\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Without objection, the first reading of the \\\\nbill is dispensed. With--and without objection, the bill is \\\\nconsidered as read and open for amendment. Do any Members seek \\\\nrecognition for the purpose of offering an amendment?\\\\n    Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 7988 \\\\nin favor of reporting it to the House.\\\\n    All those in favor, say aye.\\\\n    All those opposed, say no.\\\\n    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.\\\\n    Do you seek recognition?\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. I ask for a recorded vote. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested and a roll \\\\ncall vote is ordered. Pursuant to committee rule 13 and House \\\\nrule XI, any further proceedings on the bill are postponed.\\\\n    H.R. 7985\\\\n    The next bill we will markup is H.R. 7985, Entrepreneurs \\\\nwith Disabilities Reporting Act of 2024, introduced by \\\\nRepresentatives McGarvey and Molinaro. I now recognize the \\\\nbill&#x27;s sponsor, Mr. McGarvey for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for \\\\nyour support of H.R. 7985 and for including it in today&#x27;s \\\\nmarkup.\\\\n    I would also like to especially thank Chairman Molinaro. \\\\nNot only is he the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Innovation, \\\\nEntrepreneurship, and Workforce Development, but he held a \\\\nreally great hearing about how we help people with disabilities \\\\nbecome entrepreneurs and he very compassionately, courageously \\\\ndetailed the obstacles his own daughter has faced. And of \\\\ncourse, brought up, for everyone on that subcommittee, brought \\\\nup Maeve from Maeve&#x27;s Coffee in the Hudson Valley, who was an \\\\nabsolute star in showing us the opportunities that exist if we \\\\nare willing to invest and make this part of the American Dream \\\\navailable to everybody.\\\\n    I was also honored to have my constituent, Cody Clark, come \\\\nup from Louisville, a small business owner, disability rights \\\\nadvocate, and I think the first person to perform a magic trick \\\\nin front of this committee, at least this Congress. He did a \\\\ngreat job telling us about the problems that people with \\\\ndisabilities face and his experience as an entrepreneur. His \\\\nexperience and those like the ones we heard from helped lead to \\\\ntoday&#x27;s legislation.\\\\n    This bipartisan legislation will require the Small Business \\\\nAdministration to submit a report to Congress on the challenges \\\\nfaced by entrepreneurs with disabilities. The report will \\\\ninclude an assessment of these entrepreneurs&#x27; challenges and \\\\nneeds and detail what resources the SBA currently provides to \\\\nentrepreneurs with disabilities. Importantly, it is also going \\\\nto recommend legislative action to improve how the SBA serves \\\\nentrepreneurs with disabilities.\\\\n    By requiring a report from the Small Business \\\\nAdministration, this bill will better help Congress understand \\\\nhow to support these entrepreneurs who face different \\\\nchallenges. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this \\\\nbill, and yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize the bill&#x27;s cosponsor, Mr. Molinaro, for an \\\\nopening statement.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was glad to hear \\\\nthe great applause for this legislation, cheering in the \\\\nhallways. I commend Mr. McGarvey for sponsoring the bill and \\\\nthank you, Mr. Chairman, for moving the Entrepreneurs with \\\\nDisability Reporting Act here today.\\\\n    I do want to extend my appreciation, Mr. McGarvey, Cody was \\\\na wonderful witness, but also a strong testament to the ability \\\\nof every individual should be given the support from family and \\\\nremoved obstacles by government to attain success. And I for \\\\none was very grateful that Maeve was able to join us, but an \\\\nimportant hearing addressing the challenges and obstacles that \\\\nmany with intellectual, physical, and developmental \\\\ndisabilities face every day.\\\\n    This particular bill, bipartisan in nature, will provide \\\\nmuch needed clarity for entrepreneurs with disabilities as the \\\\nnavigate SBA&#x27;s complex maze of over 50 different programs \\\\ngeared towards assisting them in starting a business. As of \\\\nApril 2022, 74 percent of adults with disabilities work outside \\\\nthe traditional workforce with approximately 1.8 million of \\\\nthese individuals with disabilities as business owners \\\\nthemselves.\\\\n    Entrepreneurs of ability should have a fair shot at \\\\npursuing their passion and we ought to work hard to remove \\\\nobstacles from them.\\\\n    As the Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on \\\\nInnovation, Entrepreneurship, and Workforce Development I join \\\\nmy colleagues in remaining committed to empowering our \\\\nentrepreneurs with disabilities to contribute more to main \\\\nstreet and lead really more independent and fulfilled lives.\\\\n    I am grateful again to Mr. McGarvey and the commitment of \\\\nthis committee to move this legislation today. This act would \\\\nprovide a comprehensive assessment of the needs of our \\\\nentrepreneurs with disabilities and help to inform lawmakers of \\\\nlegislative solutions to address the challenges these \\\\nindividuals face and breakdown barriers so they can pursue \\\\ntheir employment options.\\\\n    I urge my colleagues to support the bill. As I like to say \\\\nback home this is one more effort to show America what it means \\\\nto think differently for those with intellectual, physical, and \\\\ndevelopmental disabilities.\\\\n    And with that I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a \\\\nstatement on this bill?\\\\n    If no other Members wish to be recognized, I would like to \\\\nrecognize the Ranking Member to speak on the bill.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased \\\\nsupport the legislation offered by Mr. McGarvey and Mr. \\\\nMolinaro, which will require the SBA to submit a report to \\\\nCongress on the challenges facing entrepreneurs with \\\\ndisabilities.\\\\n    There are 44 million people with disabilities in the United \\\\nStates. While progress has been made to increase employment \\\\nrates, disabled individuals lag behind people without \\\\ndisabilities. Only 26 percent of people with disabilities \\\\nparticipate in the labor force.\\\\n    As a country we can do better and we must do better. \\\\nStudies have found higher rates of self-employment among \\\\ndisabled Americans, most often because it offers more \\\\nflexibility and the ability to work remotely. That is why we \\\\nneed a comprehensive study to assess the SBA resources that are \\\\navailable to entrepreneurs with disabilities examine their \\\\neffectiveness and determine what actions need to be take to \\\\nhelp support entrepreneurs with disabilities.\\\\n    I applaud Mr. McGarvey and Mr. Molinaro for their \\\\nleadership on this issue. I support the bill, and I yield back \\\\nmy time.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    H.R. 7985, the Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Reporting \\\\nAct of 2024, will require the SBA to issue a report to Congress \\\\non the challenges individuals with disabilities face when \\\\nstarting a business. Furthermore, it would require the SBA to \\\\nlook at resources across the federal government that assist \\\\nindividuals with disabilities.\\\\n    The Government Accountability Office estimate there are \\\\nonly 50 programs across 9 federal agencies that support \\\\nemployment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. \\\\nHowever, as we know federal agencies often fail to coordinate \\\\nor collaborate on such programs to ensure that their efforts \\\\nare not duplicated.\\\\n    The Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Reporting Act of 2024 \\\\nwill require the SBA to look at this fragmented system and do \\\\nits part to consolidate and streamline these efforts. I thank \\\\nRepresentatives McGarvey and Molinaro for introducing this \\\\nlegislation. I urge all Members to vote yes.\\\\n    If there&#x27;s no further discussion, the committee now moves \\\\nto consideration of H.R. 7985. The clerk will report.\\\\n    The CLERK. H.R. 7985, to require the administrator of the \\\\nSmall Business Administration----\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Without objection, the first reading of the \\\\nbill is dispensed and, without objection, the bill is \\\\nconsidered as read and open for amendment. Do any Members seek \\\\nrecognition for purpose of offering an amendment?\\\\n    Seeing none, the question is now on the adoption of H.R. \\\\n7985 and favorably reporting to the House?\\\\n    All those in favor, say aye.\\\\n    All those opposed, say no.\\\\n    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Chairman?\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Seek recognition.\\\\n    Mr. MCGARVEY. Mr. Chairman, I seek a roll call vote.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Okay. A recorded vote has been requested and \\\\na roll call vote is ordered. Pursuant to committee rule 13 and \\\\nHouse rule XI further proceedings on the bill are postponed.\\\\n    H.R. 7989\\\\n    The next bill we will markup is H.R. 7989, the \\\\nThinkDIFFERENTLY About Disabilities Employment Act, introduced \\\\nby Representatives Molinaro and Pappas.\\\\n    I now recognize the bill&#x27;s sponsor, Mr. Molinaro for an \\\\nopening statement.\\\\n    Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. I am proud to \\\\nspeak in favor of this bill and very grateful to the committee \\\\nfor moving forward H.R. 7989, the ThinkDIFFERENTLY About \\\\nDisabilities Employment Act.\\\\n    Building off of a nationwide effort to an initiative we \\\\nrefer to as ThinkDIFFERENTLY in my home state this bill will \\\\nrequire greater cooperation between the SBA and the National \\\\nCounsel on Disability to expand employment and entrepreneurship \\\\nopportunities for the disability community. In New York State \\\\nalone, as was noted, 60 percent of working-age people with \\\\ndisabilities are unemployed. Nationwide that number rises to 80 \\\\npercent of those with intellectual, physical, and developmental \\\\ndisabilities remain unemployed and outside the workforce.\\\\n    We know from small businesses throughout upstate New York \\\\nand across America, we understand the many benefits of hiring \\\\nindividuals with intellectual, physical, and developmental \\\\ndisabilities. And especially we understand that in many cases \\\\ntheir unique skillsets are sound economic investments, but, as \\\\nimportantly, help to boost company morale and make a benefit to \\\\nthe company overall. And their participation in the workforce \\\\npromotes greater employee engagement.\\\\n    The ThinkDIFFERENTLY About Disability Employment Act paves \\\\nthe way for lawmakers to assess the challenges that employees \\\\nand entrepreneurs with disabilities face while proactively \\\\nworking to ensure those with disabilities have the support to \\\\npursue real career opportunities.\\\\n    I&#x27;d like to thank my colleague, Representative Pappas, for \\\\nhis partnership and leadership on the bill and I urge my \\\\ncolleagues to support this very simple, smart, bipartisan \\\\nlegislation that is meant again to tear down barriers and \\\\ncreate opportunities for everyone of every ability and perhaps \\\\nshow Congress and the world what it means to think differently.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize \\\\nthe bill&#x27;s cosponsor, Mr. Pappas, for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. PAPPAS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Small \\\\nbusiness ownership is a major pathway for all Americans to \\\\nachieve success and self-sufficiency and people with \\\\ndisabilities participate in entrepreneurship at a higher rate \\\\nthan nondisabled Americans. The ThinkDIFFERENTLY About \\\\nDisability Employment Act will support collaboration between \\\\nSBA and the National Counsel on Disability to help folks with \\\\ndisabilities pursue small business ownership and employment \\\\nopportunities.\\\\n    Individuals with disabilities deserve equal access to \\\\nsupport from SBA and this bipartisan legislation is an \\\\nimportant step forward that will help achieve that. This will \\\\nsupport entrepreneurship and employment of individuals with \\\\ndisabilities while helping our main street economies grow and \\\\nour communities thrive.\\\\n    So, I am pleased to partner with Representative Molinaro on \\\\nthis bill. I thank him for his steadfast leadership in this \\\\nspace and I urge my colleagues to support it.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a \\\\nstatement on this bill?\\\\n    If there are no other Members who wish to be recognized, I \\\\nwould like to recognize the Ranking Member to speak on the \\\\nbill.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the sponsor \\\\nof this bill and I strongly support the bill.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. I now recognize myself to speak in support of \\\\nthis legislation.\\\\n    Individuals with disabilities are more likely to be self-\\\\nemployed than the average American. Across the federal \\\\ngovernment there are numerous programs and resources to assist \\\\nAmericans with disabilities, yet resources tailored to \\\\nentrepreneurs with disabilities at the SBA are sorely lacking. \\\\nH.R. 7989, the ThinkDIFFERENTLY About Disabilities Employment \\\\nAct, will require the SBA to enter into a Memorandum of \\\\nUnderstanding with the National Council on Disability, which is \\\\nan independent federal agency whose mission is to provide a \\\\nrecommendation to policymakers and issues impacting individuals \\\\nwith disabilities.\\\\n    This makes the National Disability Council equally \\\\nqualified or uniquely qualified to advise and assist the SBA in \\\\nthe pursuit of assisting individuals with disabilities achieve \\\\nthe American dream.\\\\n    I would like to thank Representative Molinaro for his \\\\ncommitment to ensuring Congress works to pave the pathway to \\\\nsuccess for entrepreneurs and employees with disabilities and \\\\nthank him and Mr. Pappas for introducing this legislation. I \\\\nurge all my colleagues to vote yes this legislation.\\\\n    So, if there is no further discussion, the committee now \\\\nmoves to the consideration of H.R. 7989. The clerk will report.\\\\n    The CLERK. H.R. 7989, to provide----\\\\n    Mr. WILLIAMS. Without objection, the first reading of the \\\\nbill is dispended and, without objection, the bill is \\\\nconsidered and read and open for amendment.

The committee will now come to order. The \\\\ncommittee will now resume consideration of the bills on which \\\\nroll call votes were requested and postponed.

Dan Bishop \\\\n[Chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.\\\\n    Present: Representatives Bishop, Greene, Ezell, Strong, \\\\nCrane, Thanedar, Ivey, Ramirez, and Clarke.\\\\n    Also present: Representative Thompson.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The Committee on Homeland Security, \\\\nSubcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability \\\\nwill come to order.\\\\n    The purpose of this hearing is to understand the scope and \\\\nscale of the Department of Homeland securities and CISA&#x27;s \\\\ncounter- \\\\nmis-, dis-, and mal-information efforts and why Government \\\\ncensorship continues to present a threat to the free discourse \\\\nessential to a constitutional republic.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for an opening statement.\\\\n    Good afternoon, and welcome to this hearing of the \\\\nsubcommittee titled ``Censorship Laundering, Part Two: \\\\nPreventing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Silencing \\\\nof Dissent.&#x27;&#x27; In May this subcommittee held our first hearing \\\\nto examine the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s role as the \\\\nnerve center for the Federal Government&#x27;s scheme to censor the \\\\non-line voices of millions of Americans. What we learned during \\\\nthat hearing was deeply concerning. As Americans, we are \\\\ncommitted to the idea that freedom of speech and open debate \\\\nare essential features of a free society. Make no mistake, the \\\\nefforts to censor public discourse under the guise of so-called \\\\nmis-, dis- and mal-information--MDM--threatened this essential \\\\nfreedom and the very core of our republic.\\\\n    Now, through our own investigation and the incredible work \\\\nof a small group of individuals dedicated to protecting \\\\nAmericans&#x27; fundamental rights to discourse and debate, \\\\nincluding our witnesses today, we have a far more complete \\\\npicture of the censorship-laundering complex and how it \\\\noperates. While we recognize the Cybersecurity and \\\\nInfrastructure Security Agency&#x27;s mission of protecting our \\\\ninstitutions from legitimate cybersecurity threats, we cannot \\\\nallow a component of the Department of Homeland Security to \\\\nanchor a censorship-laundering enterprise. Silencing the voices \\\\nof the American people is never acceptable by Government and we \\\\nmust return the agency to its core mission.\\\\n    Two major developments have been enormously helpful to our \\\\ninvestigations into the true extent of DHS and CISA&#x27;s role in \\\\nGovernment censorship efforts. First, several lawsuits, most \\\\nnotably Missouri v. Biden--although the assistant attorney \\\\ngeneral for the Division of Civil Rights doesn&#x27;t know about \\\\nthat litigation, I hope she will take note of it--that lawsuit \\\\nhas made public vital evidence, uncovering the scope and scale \\\\nof Government efforts to censor on-line speech. Second, Elon \\\\nMusk released the second edition of the Twitter files, exposing \\\\nthe breadth of the Government&#x27;s efforts to censor American \\\\nspeech on-line. In addition, we have learned that despite the \\\\nFederal Government&#x27;s continued denials of having any role in \\\\nthe creation of the so-called election integrity project, EIP, \\\\nthat DHS and CISA were involved from the beginning.\\\\n    Look at the words of Graham Brookie, senior director of the \\\\nAtlantic Council&#x27;s digital Forensic Research Lab, DFR Lab, one \\\\nof the four founding EIP partners who wrote this to his \\\\ncolleagues on July 21, 2020, ``We just set up an election \\\\nintegrity partnership at the request of DHS/CISA and are in \\\\nweekly comms to debrief about disinformation, disinfo, IO, et \\\\ncetera&#x27;&#x27;. As an active participant with EIP partners, CISA was, \\\\n``switchboarding&#x27;&#x27;, which is the term CISA used to describe \\\\nflagging what they called misinformation and notifying social \\\\nmedia platforms who could, ``independently&#x27;&#x27; decide whether to \\\\nremove or modify the content. CISA director Jen Easterly \\\\nclaimed earlier this year during a DHS appropriations \\\\nsubcommittee hearing that ``we don&#x27;t flag anything to social \\\\nmedia organizations&#x27;&#x27;, but that is exactly what CISA was doing.\\\\n    Moreover, while EIP and its stakeholders claimed that EIP \\\\nwas just conducting research--that is the terminology, \\\\nconducting research--the words of a senior EIP official during \\\\na transcribed interview with our committee say otherwise. \\\\n``Flagging content for social media companies was part and \\\\nparcel with the EIP&#x27;s creation&#x27;&#x27;. There is, unfortunately, far \\\\nmore evidence than I have time to describe.\\\\n    After CISA&#x27;s hands were caught in the censorship cookie jar \\\\nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have come \\\\nto the defense of its censorship-laundering enterprise, its \\\\ncensorship by proxy. They claim that there were no funding \\\\nlinks between CISA and these outside organizations, no \\\\ncensorship. At the same time, they take pains to reaffirm their \\\\ncommitment to fighting ``misinformation&#x27;&#x27;. Just last week, the \\\\nRanking Member of the full committee issued a press release \\\\ndenying that CISA created, funded, or directed the work of the \\\\nelection integrity partnership. Now, you can believe the press \\\\nrelease, or you can believe the individuals in the private \\\\nsector who were most intimately involved with this work who \\\\ntalk about how the Government gave them the ability to stomp \\\\nout misinformation. Listen, for example, to Alex Stamos.\\\\n    [Video played.]\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. As a reminder, the impact of this \\\\ncensorship effort was massive, 859 million tweets collected for \\\\n``misinformation analysis&#x27;&#x27;, 22 million tweets and retweets \\\\ncategorized as misinformation subject to censorship, 21 Twitter \\\\nusers, Americans, identified and stigmatized as ``the most \\\\nprominent repeat spreaders of disinformation&#x27;&#x27;. Every one of \\\\nwhom were on the political right. It was not just for \\\\nelections. The same network used the same tools to censor \\\\ndozens of purportedly false COVID-19 narratives, of which some \\\\nwere later proved true, but all of which were within the sphere \\\\nof free speech that the Constitution protects from Government \\\\ninterference.\\\\n    Let&#x27;s turn to where things might be headed. We know that \\\\nDHS and CISA have continued to explore ways to build on their \\\\ncounter-MDM efforts. Some of their publicly-acknowledged or \\\\ndirected efforts have been pretty Orwellian, like DHS&#x27;s ill-\\\\nconceived effort to establish a disinformation governance board \\\\nlast year, or CISA director Jen Easterly&#x27;s bizarre comment \\\\nabout controlling citizens&#x27; thoughts through regulating \\\\n``cognitive infrastructure&#x27;&#x27; as critical infrastructure reposed \\\\nto CISA&#x27;s care. Other evidence is more bureaucratic but no less \\\\nalarming. Look, for example, at CISA&#x27;s cybersecurity advisory \\\\ncommittee&#x27;s MDM subcommittee, which continues to exist and to \\\\nrecommend that CISA should expand efforts into new areas, such \\\\nas the courts, financial systems, and public health. The MDM \\\\nsubcommittee also recommended CISA view its counter-MDM work \\\\nacross a much wider range of media. Other DHS documents suggest \\\\nCISA wants also to broaden the target issues of public concern \\\\nto include racial justice, immigration, the U.S. withdrawal \\\\nfrom Afghanistan, and support to Ukraine.\\\\n    What is stopping DHS from overreaching its jurisdiction \\\\nbeyond elections to censor more Americans, to ``protect&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nwhatever Government-deployed orthodox notions it deems critical \\\\ninfrastructure? Right now, the answer is nothing. While CISA \\\\nhas made a public pretense of pulling back from some of its \\\\nmore aggressive censorship efforts, that change was driven by \\\\npublic scrutiny and not from all that appears to a fundamental \\\\nchange of heart. This is unacceptable and dangerous. Every \\\\nAmerican, even those serving in the vast Federal bureaucracy, \\\\nshould be committed to upholding Americans&#x27; fundamental rights.\\\\n    At this point, it appears the courts may provide part of \\\\nthe solution. Indeed, the District of Louisiana and the Fifth \\\\nCircuit in particular ruled in an affirmative this October that \\\\nCISA probably violated the First Amendment through its \\\\ncensorship activities. This is to be now decided by the U.S. \\\\nSupreme Court. But the issue of DHS and CISA&#x27;s censorship \\\\nefforts goes beyond a ruling on the precise contours of the \\\\nFirst Amendment. The Government&#x27;s power to censor speech, \\\\nincluding on-line speech, must be strictly limited to content \\\\nthat is not Constitutionally-protected, such as inciting \\\\nimminent lawless action. At DHS censorship became ordinary and \\\\nbanal, an everyday activity carried out by anonymous and \\\\nunaccountable bureaucrats using censorship by proxy to \\\\naccomplish indirectly and in secret what it would not have the \\\\npower to do openly.\\\\n    Congress cannot wait or hope for a court decision to stop \\\\nDHS and CISA&#x27;s overreach. Congress has a duty to rein in out of \\\\ncontrol agencies and protect the rights of the American people. \\\\nTo that end, this subcommittee will be drafting legislation \\\\nthat stops DHS and CISA&#x27;s censorious MDM efforts and prevent \\\\nDHS and CISA from working with social media platforms to \\\\nsuppress free speech on-line. The Government cannot simply \\\\nsidestep the Constitution by outsourcing censorship under the \\\\nguise of protecting critical infrastructure.\\\\n    Thank you all for joining. I look forward to hearing \\\\ntestimony from our witnesses.\\\\n    [The statement of Chairman Bishop follows:]\\\\n                    Statement of Chairman Dan Bishop\\\\n                           December 13, 2023\\\\n    Good afternoon, and welcome to this hearing of the Subcommittee on \\\\nOversight, Investigations, and Accountability titled, ``Censorship \\\\nLaundering Part II: Preventing the U.S. Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity&#x27;s Silencing of Dissent.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    In May, this subcommittee held our first hearing to examine the \\\\nDepartment of Homeland Security&#x27;s role as the nerve center for the \\\\nFederal Government&#x27;s scheme to censor the on-line voices of millions of \\\\nAmericans.

The Government \\\\n        cannot simply sidestep the Constitution by outsourcing \\\\n        censorship under the guise of protecting critical \\\\n        infrastructure.\\\\n    Thank you all for joining, and I look forward to hearing testimony \\\\nfrom our witnesses.\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the \\\\ngentleman from Maryland, Mr. Ivey, for his opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    I have to say I have a slightly different take on this than \\\\nmy friend from North Carolina in a variety of ways. I think \\\\nthat the claims about CISA being a giant censorship entity \\\\ncompletely misses the mark, based on the transcripts that I \\\\nhave seen of testimony that has been given by this committee \\\\nand to this committee and other committees here in the House. \\\\nFor example, this is a statement from Brandon Wales, he is the \\\\nCISA executive director: CISA does not and has never censored \\\\nspeech or facilitated censorship. Any such claims are patently \\\\nfalse. We can go through a few of these others, and we will, \\\\nincluding the testimony that I had mentioned a moment ago.\\\\n    For example, Mr. Masterson. Now Masterson was an \\\\ninteresting individual who came up through the Republican Party \\\\nin the Ohio State election boards. He now works for Microsoft. \\\\nBut he made a couple of statements with respect to this issue. \\\\nOne, they were never compelled, they never compelled the \\\\nplatforms to take positions or take down information. In other \\\\nwords, they never forced censorship to happen of any kind. No, \\\\nI don&#x27;t recall that happening in my experience, no.\\\\n    There are a couple other quotes from him that I would like \\\\nto share on this front, too. At any point in your experience \\\\nworking at CISA, were you advised that you had the authority to \\\\ncompel a social media company to take any particular action \\\\nrelated to any particular content on social media? No, I don&#x27;t \\\\nrecall that happening in my experience, no. Did you ever try to \\\\nexercise that authority? No, I don&#x27;t recall ever perceiving \\\\nthat I had that authority.\\\\n    Mr. Stamos, who was just mentioned a moment ago, also has \\\\ntestified here in the House. To be clear, at no time did the \\\\nEIP censor speech or have access to back-end platform systems \\\\nor data outside of public content. The EIP did not take down \\\\nposts or apply labels and had no power to do so. The EIP did \\\\nnot create targeting lists or blacklists of accounts, and the \\\\nlist of accounts included in our reports as the top spreaders \\\\nof false information were generated by our own analysis, which \\\\nimportantly occurred after the election. Mr. Stamos was the \\\\nperson who was--the tape was played a moment ago by the \\\\nChairman.\\\\n    We have got more of those, but I need to move forward \\\\nbecause I think on a couple of fronts here, we have to address \\\\nthe reality of what is going on I think behind some of this. \\\\nThere are a lot of conspiracy theories that persist that are, \\\\nin my view, dangerously weakening America&#x27;s ability to defend \\\\nitself against foreign attacks from Russia, China, and Iran. \\\\nSome of these attacks focus on America&#x27;s election and our \\\\nelection apparatus, especially since we haven&#x27;t fully responded \\\\nin the wake of the 2016 and 2020 attacks with respect to those \\\\nelections.\\\\n    In 2017, the Trump administration&#x27;s national security \\\\nstrategy included a section on information statecraft, naming \\\\nRussia and China among the adversaries seeking to ``weaponize \\\\ninformation&#x27;&#x27; for strategic gain and control. Adversaries of \\\\nthe United States leverage influence operations and \\\\ndisinformation campaigns to degrade confidence in key \\\\ninstitutions, sow civil discord, and undermine U.S. pillars of \\\\npower. For example, Russian interference in the 2016 \\\\nPresidential election, I think, is a powerful example. I know \\\\nthere has been a lot of political debate about collusion and \\\\nother issues, but the Senate Intelligence Committee found that \\\\nPutin ordered the Russian effort to hack Democratic Party \\\\nnetworks and accounts to leak information damaging to Hillary \\\\nClinton. There is also information with respect to Iranians \\\\ntrying to do the same thing on the opposite side, posing as \\\\nProud Boys to intimidate voters in the 2020 election. That is \\\\nbased on an indictment. The Department of Justice is \\\\nprosecuting individuals involved in that case. But that is on \\\\nthe other side of this. From my perspective, this isn&#x27;t a \\\\npartisan issue. That was an attempt, apparently, in their view, \\\\nhelp the Biden campaign.\\\\n    But I also think we have to focus on this because we face \\\\ninternal dangers that can come from the internet and some of \\\\nthe information that is being abused on that front. The January \\\\n6 attack against the Capitol was aimed at preventing the lawful \\\\nand peaceful transfer of power. The internet was used, the \\\\nsocial media platforms were used essentially as the principal \\\\nmeans of communications from any of those activities. Also some \\\\nof the, in my view, false conspiracy theories that have grown \\\\nout of that, like the ghost buses issue that was raised here in \\\\nthis committee a few weeks ago, I think is disinformation that \\\\nwe need to address. The recent Osama bin Laden letter, which \\\\ngot viral on the internet and ended up--I think it had over 2 \\\\nmillion views--but essentially was espousing bin Laden&#x27;s view \\\\nthat the United States was an evil country, that 9/11 was an \\\\nappropriate attack on the United States. I am concerned about \\\\nthe impact it could have, for example, on lone-wolf individuals \\\\nin the United States. There are other kinds of efforts like \\\\nthat that are aimed at reaching out directly to people in the \\\\nUnited States to encourage them to engage in terrorist \\\\nactivities.\\\\n    This is an article from the Washington Post, ``How Osama \\\\nbin Laden&#x27;s Letter to America Reached Millions Online.&#x27;&#x27; Video \\\\nciting the document had been viewed far less than many TikTok \\\\nposts. Then a journalist made a compilation and posted it on X, \\\\ncausing attention to the manifesto to explode. That was dated \\\\nNovember 16, 2023, and I offer it for the record.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Ordered to be submitted.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n\\\\n  How Osama Bin Laden&#x27;s ``Letter To America&#x27;&#x27; Reached Millions Online\\\\nBy Drew Harwell and Victoria Bisset, Updated November 16, 2023 at 5:32 \\\\n        p.m. EST/Published November 16, 2023 at 12:23 p.m. EST, The \\\\n        Washington Post.\\\\nVideos citing the document had been viewed far less than many TikTok \\\\n        posts. Then a journalist made a compilation and posted it to X, \\\\n        causing attention to the manifesto to explode.\\\\n    On Monday, a TikTok user with 371 followers, using the screen name \\\\n``_monix2,&#x27;&#x27; posted a video where she read parts of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s \\\\n``Letter to America,&#x27;&#x27; in which the late terrorist leader said his \\\\nkillings of nearly 3,000 Americans in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had \\\\nbeen justified by the United States&#x27; support of Israel&#x27;s ``occupation&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nof the Palestinian territories.\\\\n    By Wednesday night, the letter had become a point of discussion \\\\namong left-wing creators on the video app, with some saying its \\\\ncritiques of American foreign policy had opened their eyes to a history \\\\nthey&#x27;d never learned.\\\\n    But the letter didn&#x27;t rank among TikTok&#x27;s top trends. Videos with \\\\nthe #lettertoamerica hashtag had been seen about 2 million times--a \\\\nrelatively low count on a wildly popular app with 150 million accounts \\\\nin the United States alone.\\\\n    Then that evening, the journalist Yashar Ali shared a compilation \\\\nhe&#x27;d made of the TikTok videos in a post on X, formerly Twitter. That \\\\npost has been viewed more than 38 million times. By Thursday afternoon, \\\\nwhen TikTok announced it had banned the hashtag and dozens of similar \\\\nvariations, TikTok videos tagged #lettertoamerica had gained more than \\\\n15 million views.\\\\n    The letter&#x27;s spread sparked a deluge of commentary, with some \\\\nworrying that TikTok&#x27;s users were being radicalized by a terrorist \\\\nmanifesto, and TikTok&#x27;s critics arguing it was evidence that the app, \\\\nowned by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance, had been secretly boosting \\\\npropaganda to a captive audience of American youth.\\\\n    But the letter&#x27;s spread also reflected the bedeviling realities of \\\\nmodern social media, where young people--many of whom were born after \\\\n9/11--share and receive information on fast-paced smartphone apps \\\\ndesigned to make videos go viral, regardless of their content.\\\\n    It also showed how efforts to suppress such information can \\\\nbackfire. Many of the videos on TikTok were posted after the British \\\\nnewspaper the Guardian, which had hosted a copy of bin Laden&#x27;s letter, \\\\nremoved it. Some TikTokers said the removal was proof of the letter&#x27;s \\\\nwisdom and importance, leading them to further amplify it as a result.\\\\n    ``Don&#x27;t turn the long-public ravings of a terrorist into forbidden \\\\nknowledge, something people feel excited to go rediscover,&#x27;&#x27; Renee \\\\nDiResta, a research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory who \\\\nhas advised Congress on online disinformation, wrote Thursday in a post \\\\non Threads. ``Let people read the murderer&#x27;s demands--this is the man \\\\nsome TikTok fools chose to glorify. Add more context.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    TikTok spokesman Alex Haurek said Thursday that the company was \\\\n``proactively and aggressively&#x27;&#x27; removing videos promoting the letter \\\\nfor violating the company&#x27;s rules on ``supporting any form of \\\\nterrorism&#x27;&#x27; and said it was ``investigating&#x27;&#x27; how the videos got onto \\\\nits platform.\\\\n    Haurek said that the #lettertoamerica hashtag had been attached to \\\\n274 videos that had garnered 1.8 million views on Tuesday and \\\\nWednesday, before ``the tweets and media coverage drove people to the \\\\nhashtag.&#x27;&#x27; Other hashtags, for comparison, dwarfed discussion of the \\\\nletter on the platform: During a recent 24-hour period, #travel videos \\\\nhad 137 million views, #skincare videos had 252 million views and \\\\n#anime videos had 611 million views, Haurek said.\\\\n    Ali said he made the compilation video Wednesday after seeing \\\\n``thousands&#x27;&#x27; of the videos and intentionally left out the ``most \\\\nincendiary examples&#x27;&#x27; because he didn&#x27;t want the compilation to be \\\\nremoved from Instagram, where he also posted it.\\\\n    He agreed the hashtag had never trended on TikTok but disputed the \\\\nidea that the number of videos posted there had been ``small,&#x27;&#x27; saying, \\\\n``Sure, in the context of a global platform. But not small enough to be \\\\nminuscule or not important.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Most of the videos have since been removed by TikTok, making it \\\\ndifficult to get a full tally. But a search for the letter Thursday \\\\nmorning by a Washington Post reporter revealed around 700 TikTok \\\\nvideos, only a few of which got more than 1 million views.\\\\n    Such high view counts are common on TikTok, where videos are served \\\\nup in rapid fashion and the average U.S. user watches for more than an \\\\nhour a day. One viral video last month, in which a young woman \\\\ndiscussed the pain of a 9-to-5 job, has more than 3 million views and \\\\n280,000 likes.\\\\n    The videos featured many people saying they&#x27;d known little about \\\\nbin Laden and were questioning what they&#x27;d been taught about American \\\\ninvolvement around the world. Some said they were ``trying to go back \\\\nto life as normal&#x27;&#x27; after reading it; in one video, a user scrolled \\\\nthrough the full letter and said, ``We&#x27;ve been lied to our entire \\\\nlives.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    But while many pointed to bin Laden&#x27;s comments on the Palestinian \\\\nissue, few highlighted the letter&#x27;s more extreme criticism of Western \\\\n``immorality and debauchery,&#x27;&#x27; including ``acts of fornication, \\\\nhomosexuality, intoxicants, gambling and trading with interest.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Many commenters also criticized giving the letter attention or \\\\nworked to remind people that bin Laden had preached an antisemitic, \\\\nsexist ideology that led to thousands of deaths. On the ``_monix2&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nvideo, one commenter said, ``You guys Bin Laden wrote this. Do y&#x27;all \\\\nknow what he did. What is wrong with y&#x27;all [oh my God. I guess] we&#x27;re \\\\nsupporting terrorism these days.&#x27;&#x27; (Attempts to reach the @_monix2 \\\\naccount were unsuccessful.)\\\\n    Charlie Winter, a specialist in Islamist militant affairs and \\\\ndirector of research at the intelligence platform ExTrac, said in an \\\\ninterview Thursday that he was ``frankly really quite surprised at the \\\\nresponse&#x27;&#x27; to the letter, which he described as ``a kind of core \\\\ndoctrinal text&#x27;&#x27; for both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State terrorist \\\\ngroup.\\\\n    In addition to long-standing grievances, the letter contains \\\\n``blatant language that is clearly calling for acts of genocide . . . \\\\n[and] for killing noncombatants in any nation that is democratic and is \\\\nfighting against a Muslim-majority state,&#x27;&#x27; he said.\\\\n    ``It&#x27;s not the letter that is going viral. It&#x27;s a selective reading \\\\nof parts of the letter that&#x27;s going viral,&#x27;&#x27; he said. ``And I don&#x27;t \\\\nknow whether it&#x27;s because people aren&#x27;t actually reading it or, when \\\\nthey&#x27;re reading it, they&#x27;re reading the bits that they want to see.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    The letter&#x27;s spread online was celebrated Thursday by users on al-\\\\nQaeda forums, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online \\\\nextremism. One user Thursday wrote that Islamist militants should \\\\ncapitalize on the opportunity, saying, ``I hope you all are seeing \\\\nongoing storm on Social Media . . . We should post more and more \\\\ncontent.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Some of the TikTok creators who shared the letter posted follow-up \\\\nvideos saying they did not support terrorism or violence. One of the \\\\nfirst TikTok creators to share it, and who spoke to The Post on the \\\\ncondition that her name not be included in the story, said she had \\\\nencouraged people to read it for ``educational purposes.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    She said she did not ``condone nor justify&#x27;&#x27; bin Laden&#x27;s actions \\\\nand was ``distancing [herself] from this entire situation.&#x27;&#x27; ``It&#x27;s a \\\\nsad world if we cannot even read a public document, simply to educate \\\\nourselves, without being smeared online,&#x27;&#x27; she said.\\\\n    TikTok has faced criticism and calls for a nationwide ban due to \\\\nthe popularity of pro-Palestinian videos on the app compared with pro-\\\\nIsrael content, even though Facebook and Instagram show a similar gap. \\\\nIn a video call organized by TikTok on Wednesday, first reported by the \\\\nNew York Times, some Hollywood actors and TikTok creators pushed \\\\ncompany executives to do more to crack down on antisemitic content.\\\\n    But the idea that the ``Letter to America&#x27;&#x27; discussion solely began \\\\non TikTok is challenged by Google data, which show that search interest \\\\nin the ``bin Laden letter&#x27;&#x27; began gathering last week, days before it \\\\nbecame a topic of TikTok conversation.\\\\n    And TikTok is far from the only place where the letter has been \\\\ndiscussed. Though instagram blocked searches for some hashtags, some \\\\nvideos related to the letter--including those critical of it--remained \\\\npublicly viewable Thursday on the Meta-owned app.\\\\n    On Thursday afternoon, searches for ``letter to America&#x27;&#x27; on \\\\nInstagram were still being given a ``Popular&#x27;&#x27; tag. One post, a series \\\\nof screenshots of the letter, had more than 10,000 likes as of Thursday \\\\nafternoon.\\\\n    On Thursday, the letter and bin Laden&#x27;s name were also ``trending \\\\ntopics&#x27;&#x27; on X, the social network owned by Elon Musk. One tweet there \\\\nfrom Wednesday--in which the writer said reading the letter was like \\\\nfeeling a ``glass wall shatter,&#x27;&#x27; and asks, ``Is this what ex cult \\\\nmembers feel like when they become self aware&#x27;&#x27;--remained online \\\\nThursday, with nearly 3 million views.\\\\n    The letter--a nearly 4,000-word translation of the al-Qaeda \\\\nleader&#x27;s comments--had been originally posted in Arabic on a Saudi \\\\nArabian website used to disseminate al-Qaeda messages. The Guardian \\\\noriginally published an English translation in 2002 alongside a news \\\\narticle that offered more detail on how it had begun circulating among \\\\n``British Islamic extremists.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Though the Guardian removed the letter on Wednesday, its \\\\nreplacement, a page called ``Removed: document,&#x27;&#x27; had by Thursday \\\\nbecome one of the most-viewed stories on the newspaper&#x27;s website. Some \\\\nTikTokers voiced anger at the newspaper for, in the words of one, \\\\n``actively censoring&#x27;&#x27; information.\\\\n    A spokesperson for the Guardian said in a statement that the letter \\\\nhad been removed after it was ``widely shared on social media without \\\\nthe full context.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    The editors of the Guardian faced a ``no-win scenario&#x27;&#x27; once \\\\ninterest in bin Laden&#x27;s letter began to grow, Marco Bastos, a senior \\\\nlecturer in media and communication at City University of London, said \\\\nin a phone interview.\\\\n    ``If they don&#x27;t take down the content, the content will be \\\\nleveraged and it will be discussed, potentially shared and is going to \\\\ngo viral--if not out of context, then certainly outside of the scope of \\\\nthe original piece,&#x27;&#x27; Bastos said. ``If they take it down, they&#x27;re \\\\ngoing to be accused, as they are right now, of censorship.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    At the time of publication, the editors ``expected that this letter \\\\nwould be read critically, you know, adversarially . . . that you would \\\\nprocess this within the view--or the bias, if you prefer--of the \\\\nWestern side of the events,&#x27;&#x27; Bastos added. ``And now it&#x27;s being \\\\nconsumed, distributed and shared to push an agenda that&#x27;s precisely the \\\\nopposite of the one that it was originally intended for.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Winter, the Islamist militant affairs specialist, said he found it \\\\n``kind of ironic&#x27;&#x27; that the letter was being shared uncritically around \\\\nthe web.\\\\n    ``People who consider themselves to be critical consumers of \\\\nmainstream media are consuming this very uncritically and not thinking \\\\nabout the context around it,&#x27;&#x27; he said. ``Not thinking about everything \\\\nthat happened just over a year before it was published as well, in any \\\\nmeaningful way.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Bisset reported from London.\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. I think it is important for CISA to continue to \\\\nnot only exist, but continue to operate at full capacity. I \\\\nknow there have been some efforts to reduce its capabilities, \\\\nbut the 2018 and 2020 cycles, the censorship issues, CISA \\\\nconnected election stakeholders to social media platforms in a \\\\nnonpartisan manner by forwarding election disinformation, \\\\nreporting from election officials to both parties to the \\\\nrelevant platforms. I believe we have got an email here from \\\\nthe RNC that was sent to CISA. This is, again, in an effort to \\\\nbe bipartisan on this front, the RNC detected misinformation \\\\nthat was being circulated in Philadelphia during that campaign \\\\ncycle, that election workers were going to be paid, and that \\\\nwas incorrect. It worked its way up the chain. I didn&#x27;t put all \\\\nof the emails on this board here, but at the end of it, they \\\\nsent it to CISA seeking help into taking down the information \\\\nso the disinformation wouldn&#x27;t spread. I don&#x27;t know if that \\\\nkind of funding is illegal in Pennsylvania, but I think the \\\\nmain point is that the RNC, at least in that election cycle, \\\\ndidn&#x27;t view this as some sort of censorship effort, this was \\\\njust an effort to make sure that they got correct information \\\\nout to the public. That is true in other scenarios, too. One of \\\\nthe issues that we have seen pop up, false information with \\\\nrespect to elections. The election is going to happen on \\\\nWednesday instead of Tuesday. The Government needs to be able \\\\nto correct that kind of misinformation.\\\\n    Also, there is a point I wanted to make too, about this. I \\\\nthink the argument seems to be that CISA was essentially \\\\ncompelling people, these platforms, to remove or edit \\\\ninformation that was available on that platform. But all the \\\\nemails that we have seen had a disclaimer that was displayed on \\\\nthe screen. This is attached and you can see down at the bottom \\\\nof it there basically it says ``CISA affirms that it neither \\\\nhas nor seeks the ability to remove or edit what information is \\\\nmade available on social media platforms. CISA makes no \\\\nrecommendation about how the information that is sharing should \\\\nbe handled or used by social media companies.&#x27;&#x27; Social media \\\\nplatforms make their own decisions regarding the content on \\\\ntheir platforms, and each have their own rules regarding the \\\\nlabeling and removal of mis- and disinformation. Of the posts \\\\nflagged by the EIP, platforms took action on 35 percent, 21 \\\\npercent were labeled, 13 percent were removed, 1 percent were \\\\nsoft-blocked. No action was taken on 65 percent of those. This \\\\nis not Government censorship or censorship by proxy. Social \\\\nmedia companies are privately-owned and make content decisions \\\\nbased on their terms of service.\\\\n    I also want to raise this issue with respect to the \\\\nelections that are coming up. State and local officials in \\\\nthese elections are seeking the assistance of not only the \\\\nFederal Government, but of each other because a lot of these \\\\nchallenges that arise have Nation-wide impact and affect their \\\\ndifferent States, even if the misinformation or false \\\\ninformation arises somewhere else. So State and local officials \\\\nfrom 21 different States requested CISA&#x27;s assistance leading up \\\\nto the 2020 election, including Republican officials, to \\\\naddress foreign influence operations and disinformation. \\\\nKentucky State officials flagged tweets that falsely indicated \\\\nDemocratic votes were being under-counted in favor of \\\\nRepublican votes during a contentious Senate race, a county in \\\\nFlorida for the supervisor of elections shared threats emailed \\\\nto Democratic voters. The Donald Trump campaign and the RNC \\\\nflagged the misinformation about an RNC volunteer stipend \\\\nprogram. We showed that already. According to an April 2023 \\\\nsurvey, 85 percent of local election officials responded that \\\\nit is beneficial ``for CISA to dispel false information about \\\\nelections by promoting accurate information on election \\\\nadministration and technology&#x27;&#x27;.\\\\n    I will wind this up. I do want to get to the testimony of \\\\nboth panels. But I did want to raise these points about the \\\\nMissouri v. Biden case. I think it is important to note that \\\\nthe Fifth Circuit put a stay on the rulings that the District \\\\nCourt had issued, particularly with respect to the limitations \\\\non the Government from having interactions with social media \\\\nplatforms. I guess the District Court had imposed essentially a \\\\ntotal restriction on it. The Fifth Circuit rolled that back. I \\\\nthink it is fair. I have read some versions of this, and I have \\\\nread the opinion myself. That some of the opinions, the \\\\nDistrict Court&#x27;s opinions information is based on false \\\\ninformation or misinformation as well. So I am hoping that as \\\\nthis case works its way through the courts--and I wouldn&#x27;t be \\\\nshocked if the Supreme Court remanded it for additional \\\\nfindings of fact--that a lot of this will be addressed.\\\\n    But the main point I want to make before I wrap up is that \\\\nI am concerned that there has been a chilling effect with \\\\nrespect to CISA, the social media platforms, people who are \\\\ndoing research. They are concerned about if they raise their \\\\nhead up they get in trouble, they get subpoenas, they get \\\\ndoxed. We have got a couple of statements with respect to that. \\\\nBut I think it is important for us to make sure that we want to \\\\nmake sure there is no censorship going on. I think that my \\\\ncolleagues on the other side have significantly overstated that \\\\nbased on the transcripts I have seen. But importantly, I think \\\\nwe have to keep in mind that not only do we have to worry about \\\\nmaking sure we have the apparatus in place, for example, to \\\\ndeal with child sexual exploitation and terrorism on-line, but \\\\nalso that we are able to address election issues, other types \\\\nof foreign attacks that might be encouraging people to engage \\\\nin terrorism or the like. We have to make sure that we have \\\\nthat capability up and ready to go, that people feel that they \\\\ncan do the work and reach their own conclusions. We might \\\\ndisagree about those conclusions, whether a particular social \\\\nmedia platform takes information down or not. I don&#x27;t know \\\\nthere is going to be universal agreement on all of that, but I \\\\nthink we need to make sure that people feel they can operate in \\\\na safe environment, and that includes exercising their First \\\\nAmendment right.\\\\n    So, Mr. Chairman, we may draw the line in different places, \\\\nclearly we do, but I think our ultimate goal is the same.\\\\n    So with that, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Ranking Member Ivey.\\\\n    Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening \\\\nstatements may be submitted for the record.\\\\n    [The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]\\\\n             Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson\\\\n                           December 13, 2023\\\\n    Today, I am pleased to be here to set the record straight on a \\\\ndangerous and unfounded conspiracy theory that my Republican colleagues \\\\ncontinue to promote: the notion that the Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity (DHS) engaged in Government censorship.\\\\n    In 2016, Russian information operations targeting our elections \\\\ncaught the United States flatfooted and caused alarm across the \\\\nintelligence community and among State and local election officials. \\\\nDuring both the 2018 and 2020 election cycles, foreign adversaries \\\\ncontinued to disseminate false claims to undermine U.S. elections and \\\\nstoke division between political parties.\\\\n    In response to requests for assistance from election officials, \\\\nthen-President Trump&#x27;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency \\\\n(CISA) forwarded messages from election officials--both Republicans and \\\\nDemocrats--to alert social media platforms to election related mis- and \\\\ndisinformation that was spreading widely on social media. During the \\\\n2020 election cycle, State and local election officials increasingly \\\\nbegan to flag posts that would mislead voters on where, when, or how to \\\\nvote, as well as threats to intimidate or interfere with voters.\\\\n    CISA served as an intermediary between election officials and the \\\\nsocial media platforms, each of which had their own rules regarding the \\\\nlabeling and removal of mis- and disinformation. To be clear, every \\\\nmessage CISA forwarded from election officials to social media \\\\ncompanies included a disclaimer at the end that read, in part:\\\\n\\\\n``CISA affirms that it neither has nor seeks the ability to remove or \\\\nedit what information is made available on social media platforms. CISA \\\\nmakes no recommendation about how the information it is sharing should \\\\nbe handled or used by social media companies. Additionally, CISA will \\\\nnot take any action, favorable or unfavorable, toward social media \\\\ncompanies based on decisions about how or whether to use this \\\\ninformation.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n    A small number of posts flagged by election officials and forwarded \\\\nby CISA were removed by the platforms, and others were labeled as false \\\\ninformation. The vast majority, however, went unabated. Ultimately, \\\\ndecisions regarding flagged content were made by private companies \\\\nunbeholden to CISA or any other Government entity. I cannot emphasize \\\\nenough that these efforts to protect America&#x27;s elections, and CISA&#x27;s \\\\ninvolvement, were hardly a secret. Representatives from CISA sat before \\\\nthis very committee in 2019 and told Members in public hearings exactly \\\\nwhat CISA was doing.\\\\n    At an October 2019 field hearing, CISA&#x27;s then-Senior Cybersecurity \\\\nAdvisor stated, ``We don&#x27;t recommend any actions to take on the \\\\nactivity, but we are able to pass it on and say, `Here is activity \\\\nthat&#x27;s been reported to us. Here is the contact for the State or local \\\\nelection official reporting.&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to submit the hearing \\\\ntranscript from October 2019 into the record.*\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    * The document has been retained in committee files and is \\\\navailable at https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/\\\\nLC65098/text?s=5&amp;r=90.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    It was not until Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and refused to \\\\nuphold our country&#x27;s tradition of peaceful transitions of power, that \\\\nRepublican Members of Congress took issue with CISA&#x27;s well-known \\\\nactivities. As soon as CISA officials refused to go along with the \\\\n``Big Lie&#x27;&#x27;, Republican Members of Congress began to slander the agency \\\\nand initiate baseless investigations.\\\\n    Despite CISA&#x27;s transparency about its activities, Republicans have \\\\nused a twisted version of the facts, promoted by a fringe alt-right \\\\nconspiracy theorist, to justify these allegations. This conspiracy uses \\\\nout-of-context quotes and blatant lies to promote the idea that CISA \\\\nengaged in censorship, or censorship by proxy, directed at conservative \\\\nposters. Yet, the countless pages of documents and witness testimony \\\\nprovided to this committee over the last year do not show anything more \\\\nthan what the agency told us back in 2019.\\\\n    While CISA may have shared information with various social media \\\\nplatforms, those companies were not working at the direction of any \\\\nGovernment agency. Any decisions made to remove social media posts were \\\\nmade by the companies themselves, according to their terms of service. \\\\nMy Republican colleagues, and the conspiracy theorists who feed them \\\\nthis false narrative, have not once been able to show that CISA engaged \\\\nin censorship against Americans. But that has not stopped Members of \\\\nthis committee from spreading disinformation about CISA&#x27;s activities.\\\\n    In the subcommittee&#x27;s May hearing on this topic, Republicans \\\\ncontinued to spread this false narrative by inviting a witness who \\\\nclaimed that the U.S. Government censored his posts on social media. \\\\nHowever, when pressed by a Member, the witness admitted that he had no \\\\nidea why the social media companies removed his posts, and had \\\\nabsolutely no proof that the Federal Government, let alone CISA or DHS \\\\nin particular, was involved in any way. Meanwhile, as my Republican \\\\ncolleagues waste time trying to prove something that didn&#x27;t happen, the \\\\nthreat that the rampant spread of mis- and disinformation poses \\\\npersists.\\\\n    Following the devastating wildfires in Maui earlier this year, \\\\nresearchers found what they believe to be a Chinese-directed campaign \\\\nto spread disinformation that the fire was caused by the U.S. \\\\nGovernment itself. These kinds of rumors make FEMA&#x27;s job to assist \\\\ncommunities with resources following disasters more difficult.\\\\n    In another example, Customs and Border Protection contends with the \\\\nresults of lies spread by cartels and human smugglers everyday, as \\\\nmigrants are fed false information to encourage them to cross the \\\\nSouthwest Border.\\\\n    And as we look ahead to the 2024 election, the Federal Government&#x27;s \\\\nefforts to counter dangerous election-related disinformation will be \\\\nseverely hobbled by Republicans spreading this dangerous conspiracy \\\\ntheory about CISA. Already, these attacks have had a chilling effect on \\\\nthose who were previously studying ways to combat mis- and \\\\ndisinformation. Unchecked mis- and disinformation will affect all \\\\nAmerican citizens, regardless of political party.\\\\n    I hope that today, with the opportunity to hear from CISA and DHS \\\\nofficials directly, we can finally put these baseless allegations to \\\\nrest once and for all.\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Bishop.

Thank you, Chairman Bishop, Ranking \\\\nMember Ivey, and Members of the subcommittee for inviting my \\\\ntestimony.\\\\n    Researchers asked by the U.S. Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity to flag election and COVID misinformation to social \\\\nmedia platforms in 2020 and 2021 say that they didn&#x27;t break the \\\\nlaw. According to the leaders of the Stanford Internet \\\\nObservatory and the other groups involved, they simply alerted \\\\nsocial media platforms to potential violations of their terms \\\\nof service. What the platforms chose to do after that was up to \\\\nthem. But during the 2 years the DHS-empowered researchers were \\\\nasking social media platforms to take down, throttle, or \\\\notherwise censor social media posts, the President of the \\\\nUnited States was accusing big tech of killing people. His \\\\nthen-press secretary said publicly that the administration was \\\\n``flagging violative posts for Facebook&#x27;&#x27;. Members of Congress \\\\nthreatened to strip social media platforms of their legal right \\\\nto operate because they said the platforms weren&#x27;t censoring \\\\nenough. Many supposedly disinterested researchers were \\\\naggressively demanding that the platforms change their terms of \\\\nservice. It&#x27;s true that the social media platforms are private \\\\ncompanies, technically free to censor content as they see fit \\\\nand are under no clearly stated obligation to obey demands by \\\\nthe U.S. Government or its authorized researchers at Stanford \\\\nor elsewhere. But the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution \\\\nstates clearly that the Government should take no action that \\\\nwould limit free speech. The record shows that the U.S. \\\\nGovernment in general, and DHS in particular, did just that.\\\\n    DHS supported, created, and participated in the 2020 Cyber \\\\nThreat Intelligence League, the 2020 Election Integrity \\\\nPartnership, or EIP, and the 2021 Virality Project, or VP. In \\\\nthe case of the EIP and VP, four think tanks led by Stanford \\\\nInternet Observatory and reporting to CISA demanded and \\\\nachieved mass censorship of the American people in direct \\\\nviolation of the First Amendment. A long-time U.S. Navy officer \\\\nand U.K. military contractor created this so-called anti-\\\\ndisinformation wing of the CTIL, Cyber Threat Intelligence \\\\nLeague, in 2020. In doing so, they pioneered the misdescription \\\\nof censorship laundering as cybersecurity. They used CTIL as a \\\\nfront group to demand censorship and demanded that cognitive \\\\nsecurity be viewed as their responsibility in addition to \\\\nphysical security and cybersecurity. DHS publicly blessed this \\\\nproject and its staff helped create CTL&#x27;s anti-disinformation \\\\nefforts and participated actively in its internal Slack \\\\nmessaging program.\\\\n    The explanations and justifications by the creators and \\\\nleaders of the EIP and VP have shifted over the last 9 months. \\\\nAt first, an SIO executive, Renee DiResta, claimed in a video \\\\nfor DHS that the idea for EIP came from SIO&#x27;s interns, who \\\\nhappened to be working at DHS at the time. More recently, \\\\nanother SIO executive, Alex Stamos, claimed that the idea was \\\\nhis. Then last month, this committee released documents \\\\nestablishing that DHS authorized groups believed that the idea \\\\nhad come from DHS. ``We just set up an election integrity \\\\npartnership at the request of DHS, CISA&#x27;&#x27; said Atlantic Council \\\\nsenior executive Graham Brookie. After Matt Taibi and I \\\\ntestified before Congress in March, a Stanford Observatory \\\\nspokesperson said, ``It did not censor or ask social media \\\\nplatforms to remove any social media content regarding \\\\ncoronavirus vaccine side effects.&#x27;&#x27; That turned out not to be \\\\ntrue, as internal messages from its operation released publicly \\\\nby the committee last month proved. Consider the language that \\\\nwas used--Hi Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter, we recommend it be \\\\nremoved from your platforms. We repeat our recommendation that \\\\nthis account be suspended. We recommend labeling. We recommend \\\\nthat you flag as false or remove the post below.\\\\n    Under the guise of a research project, EIP was enmeshed \\\\nwith the Federal Government leading up to the 2020 election. \\\\nFour students involved in EIP were even employed by CISA. One \\\\nStanford student, for example, worked as a DHS intern inside \\\\nthe EIP network. These internal emails show that CISA and its \\\\nnonprofit partners reported political speech to social media \\\\nplatforms, including jokes, hyperbole, and the types of \\\\nviewpoints and nonspecific statements that CIS once claimed it \\\\nwould not censor.\\\\n    In 2020, Department of Homeland Security officials and \\\\npersonnel from EIP were often on emails together and CISA&#x27;s \\\\npersonnel had access to EIP&#x27;s tickets through an internal \\\\nmessaging system known as Jira. Anyone who doubts that DHS \\\\nauthorized organizations, SIO chief among them, need only look \\\\nat the internal workflow graphic in a VIP proposal obtained \\\\nearlier this week through a FOIA request by my colleague Matt \\\\nTaibbi. It shows how disinformation ``incidents are routed to \\\\nplatform partners for takedowns&#x27;&#x27;. Everybody understood exactly \\\\nwhat was going on. These were demands for censorship. I should \\\\njust add here that I absolutely support counterspeech. I agree \\\\nthat if there&#x27;s false information out there about elections, \\\\nthe point is to respond publicly to it. That&#x27;s not what was \\\\nhappening here. They were demanding that information be \\\\ncensored. It wasn&#x27;t just around the date of the election or the \\\\nsecurity of mail-in ballots, it was on a whole range of social \\\\nand political issues, which the Supreme Court has historically \\\\nprotected more than any other form of speech.\\\\n    I would just close by saying, if you set aside for a moment \\\\nthe Orwellian aspects of CISA&#x27;s efforts at mind control, what \\\\ndo we think the consequences could be of CISA taking its eye \\\\noff the cybersecurity ball so it can crusade with Stanford \\\\ninterns against wrongthink? Should we be able to sleep soundly \\\\nat night knowing that CISA is focused on the problem of people \\\\nbeing wrong on the internet, rather than on China, Russia, \\\\nIran, and other malicious actors seeking to harm American \\\\nbusinesses, Government agencies, and our citizens? What&#x27;s at \\\\nstake here is our fundamental freedom to express our views on \\\\ncontroversial social and political issues without fear of \\\\nGovernment censorship.\\\\n    Thank you very much.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Shellenberger follows:]\\\\n              Prepared Statement of Michael Shellenberger\\\\n                           December 13, 2023\\\\n    Chairman Green, Chairman Bishop, Chairman Ivey, and Members of the \\\\nsubcommittee, thank you for inviting my testimony.\\\\n    Researchers asked by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \\\\nto flag election and Covid misinformation to social media platforms in \\\\n2020 and 2021 say that they didn&#x27;t break the law.

Another explains that \\\\nwhile such activities overseas are ``typically&#x27;&#x27; done by ``the CIA and \\\\nNSA and the Department of Defense,&#x27;&#x27; censorship efforts ``against \\\\nAmericans&#x27;&#x27; have to be done using private partners because the \\\\nGovernment doesn&#x27;t have the ``legal authority.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    DHS publicly blessed this project, and its staff helped create \\\\nCTIL&#x27;s ``anti-disinformation&#x27;&#x27; efforts.\\\\n    The CTI League aimed to implement something called ``AMITT,&#x27;&#x27; which \\\\nstood for ``Adversarial Misinformation and Influence Tactics and \\\\nTechniques.&#x27;&#x27; AMITT was a disinformation framework that included many \\\\noffensive actions, including working to influence government policy, \\\\ndiscrediting alternative media, using bots and sock puppets, pre-\\\\nbunking, and pushing counter-messaging. The specific ``counters&#x27;&#x27; to \\\\n``disinformation&#x27;&#x27; in AMITT and its successor framework, DISARM, \\\\nincluded the following:\\\\n   ``Create policy that makes social media police \\\\n        disinformation&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n   ``Strong dialog between the Federal Government and private \\\\n        sector to encourage better reporting&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n   ``Marginalize and discredit extremists&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n   ``Name and shame influencers&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n   ``Simulate misinformation and disinformation campaigns, and \\\\n        responses to them, before campaigns happen&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n   ``Use banking to cutoff access&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n   ``Inoculate populations through media literacy training&#x27;&#x27;.\\\\n    The explanations and justifications by the creators and leaders of \\\\nthe EIP and VP have shifted over the last 9 months.

One Stanford student, for \\\\nexample, worked as a DHS intern ``inside the EIP network.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    It is clear from the emails released by this committee that the \\\\nsupposedly independent Election Integrity Partnership (EIP) and CISA \\\\nwere working together and interacted. One email from a Colorado \\\\nofficial was addressed to ``EI-ISAC, CISA, and Stanford partners,&#x27;&#x27; \\\\ndirectly referring to EIP. The CISA-funded non-profit, Center for \\\\nInternet Security (CIS), also sent alleged misinformation to social \\\\nmedia companies.\\\\n    CIS had previously claimed that its definition of election mis- and \\\\ndisinformation did not include ``content that is polarizing, biased, \\\\npartisan or contains viewpoints expressed about elections or \\\\npolitics,&#x27;&#x27; ``inaccurate statements about an elected or appointed \\\\nofficial, candidate, or political party,&#x27;&#x27; or ``broad, non-specific \\\\nstatements about the integrity of elections or civic processes that do \\\\nnot reference a specific current election administration activity.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    But the DHS emails reveal that CISA and CIS did, in fact, consider \\\\nsuch content to be subject to censorship. The emails show that CISA and \\\\nits non-profit partners reported political speech to social media \\\\ncompanies, including jokes, hyperbole, and the types of ``viewpoints&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nand ``non-specific statements&#x27;&#x27; that CIS once claimed it would not \\\\ncensor. Using the pretext of ``election security,&#x27;&#x27; DHS sought to \\\\ncensor politically-inconvenient speech about election legitimacy.\\\\n    Messages 1 year later also showed VP researchers urging censorship \\\\nof ``general anti-vaccination&#x27;&#x27; posts, of the CDC&#x27;s own data, of \\\\naccurate claims of natural immunity, of accurate information from the \\\\njournal Lancet, of anti-lockdown protests, and even of someone&#x27;s entire \\\\nGoogle Drive.\\\\n    In 2020, Department of Homeland officials and personnel from EIP \\\\nwere often on emails together, and CISA&#x27;s personnel had access to EIP&#x27;s \\\\ntickets through an internal messaging system, Jira, which EIP used to \\\\nflag and report social media posts to Twitter, Facebook, and other \\\\nplatforms. And CISA included a threatening disclaimer in its email. It \\\\nstated that ``information may also be shared with law enforcement or \\\\nintelligence agencies.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    CISA was not supposed to have involvement in EIP&#x27;s flagging \\\\nactivities, but, notes the House Judiciary, numerous Jira tickets \\\\nmention CISA, and CISA referenced EIP Jira codes when switchboarding. \\\\nStanford&#x27;s legal counsel insisted that EIP and SIO ``did not provide \\\\nany Government agency . . . access to the Jira database,&#x27;&#x27; but in one \\\\nNovember 2020 email, SIO Director Alex Stamos told a Reddit employee, \\\\n``It would be great if we could get somebody from Reddit on JIRA, just \\\\nlike Facebook, Google, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, CISA, EI-ISAC . . . \\\\n&#x27;&#x27; Stamos&#x27;s statement indicated that CISA had access to EIP&#x27;s Jira \\\\nsystem.\\\\n    In communications with social media platforms, the House report \\\\nstates, Stamos made it clear ``that the EIP&#x27;s true purpose was to act \\\\nas a censorship conduit for the Federal Government.&#x27;&#x27; In an email to \\\\nNextdoor, Stamos wrote that EIP would ``provide a one-stop shop for \\\\nlocal election officials, DHS, and voter protection organizations to \\\\nreport potential disinformation for us to investigate and to refer to \\\\nthe appropriate platforms if necessary.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Anyone who doubts that the DHS-authorized organizations, SIO chief \\\\namong them, need only look at the ``Internal Workflow&#x27;&#x27; graphic in a VP \\\\nproposal obtained earlier this week through a FOIA request by Taibbi. \\\\nIt shows how disinformation ``Incidents are routed to platform partners \\\\n. . . for . . . takedowns.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    ``Psychological and influence operations have long been used to \\\\nsecure military objectives,&#x27;&#x27; noted my colleague. ``We now have clear \\\\nevidence that, with the creation of CTIL and its partnership with CISA, \\\\n[the censorship leaders] pioneered the use of psychological strategies \\\\nto combat populism at home by censoring information and narratives \\\\nassociated with populist discontent.&#x27;&#x27; Today, the Defense Department \\\\nand its contractors openly discuss the importance of ``cognitive \\\\nwarfare,&#x27;&#x27; not just ``security,&#x27;&#x27; aimed at the American people.\\\\n    While I believe all of the above is transparently unconstitutional, \\\\nthere is the possibility that The Supreme Court will not rule against \\\\nit after it hears the Missouri v Biden censorship lawsuit next year. \\\\nSome justices may conclude that somehow the First Amendment does not \\\\ncover the internet, or that governments outsourcing censorship to \\\\nthird-party ``cut-outs&#x27;&#x27; or front groups is justified even though the \\\\nSupreme Court has called it ``axiomatic&#x27;&#x27; that the Government cannot \\\\nfacilitate private parties violating the Constitution on its behalf. \\\\nStill other justices may claim that the First Amendment requires a very \\\\nhigh bar for Government coercion of private actors, even though the \\\\nFirst Amendment prohibits Government limitations on freedom of speech \\\\nbroadly, not just through coercion.\\\\n    As such, the importance of this DHS oversight committee in \\\\nprotecting our freedom of speech is essential.\\\\n    Setting aside the clear and present threat that DHS poses to our \\\\nfirst and most fundamental freedom, there is another problem related to \\\\nDHS&#x27;s censorship activities, and that&#x27;s the ways in which it distracts \\\\nfrom and thus undermines our Nation&#x27;s cybersecurity.\\\\n    As this committee knows well, the internet is more essential than \\\\nany other piece of America&#x27;s infrastructure because every major aspect \\\\nof civilization depends upon it, including our electrical grids, our \\\\ntransportation networks, and our policing and security systems. If \\\\ncyber attacks take down or undermine the internet, the consequences \\\\ncould be catastrophic.\\\\n    Given that, does this committee believe it makes sense for the head \\\\nof the DHS&#x27;s so-called ``Cybersecurity and Information Security \\\\nAgency,&#x27;&#x27; CISA, to be involved in policing what people say, hear, and \\\\nthink?\\\\n    Set aside for a moment the Orwellian aspects of CISA&#x27;s efforts at \\\\nmind control. What do we think the consequences could be of CISA taking \\\\nits eye off the cybersecurity ball so that it can crusade with Stanford \\\\ninterns against wrongthink? Should we be able to sleep soundly at night \\\\nknowing that CISA is focused on the problem of people being wrong on \\\\nthe internet rather than on China, Russia, Iran, and other malicious \\\\nactors seeking to harm American businesses, Government agencies, and \\\\nour citizens?\\\\n    Over the last 100 years, the Supreme Court created a tiny number of \\\\nexceptions to the radical commitment to freedom of speech enshrined in \\\\nour Constitution. Nobody questions the need for governments to fight \\\\nfraud, child exploitation, and the immediate incitement of violence.\\\\n    What&#x27;s at stake here is our fundamental freedom to express our \\\\nviews on controversial social and political issues without fear of \\\\nGovernment censorship. CISA drifted so far from its mission that it \\\\nslid down the slipperiest slope in American political life.\\\\n    I believe this dramatic situation requires the abolition of CISA. \\\\nIf it is doing good cybersecurity work, then it should be placed under \\\\nthe supervision of different leadership at a different agency free from \\\\nthe awful and unlawful behaviors of the last 3 years.\\\\n    However, I am also a realist and recognize that guardrails may be \\\\nall that can be imposed. If that is the direction in which this \\\\ncommittee chooses to go, then I would encourage very bright lines \\\\nbetween cybersecurity and ``cognitive security.&#x27;&#x27; While censorship \\\\nadvocates have tried to blur that line, it is, in reality, quite clear \\\\nto everyone what constitutes security and what constitutes censorship.\\\\n    Nonetheless, something must be done to make clear, in DHS-CISA&#x27;s \\\\nmandate, that the agency recognizes the distinction and will never \\\\nagain transgress its mandate in violation of our Constitution.\\\\n    The turning against the American people of counterterrorism tactics \\\\nonce reserved for foreign enemies should terrify all of us and inspire \\\\na clear statement that never again shall our military, intelligence, \\\\nand law enforcement guardians engage in such a recklessly ideological \\\\nand partisan ``warfare&#x27;&#x27; against civilians.\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Bishop.

Good afternoon, Chairman Bishop, Ranking \\\\nMember Ivey, Members, and guests.\\\\n    My name is Mark Chenoweth, and I&#x27;m the president of the New \\\\nCivil Liberties Alliance, a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights \\\\ngroup founded by Professor Philip Hamburger of Columbia Law \\\\nSchool to fight unlawful administrative power. NCLA fills the \\\\nvoid left by legacy civil liberties groups that no longer care \\\\nabout Government-directed censorship. NCLA&#x27;s motto is, let \\\\njudges judge, let legislators legislate, and don&#x27;t let \\\\nbureaucrats do either. We champion the people&#x27;s right to be \\\\ngoverned by representatives they pick, and Congress&#x27; job to \\\\nwrite the laws.\\\\n    Congress never authorized the administrative state \\\\ncensorship we are discussing today. My written testimony \\\\nexplains NCLA&#x27;s public interest litigation combating social \\\\nmedia censorship on behalf of four individuals in the Murthy v. \\\\nMissouri Supreme Court case. But I&#x27;m here today to sound the \\\\nalarm on four legal principles Congress must uphold to stop the \\\\nrampant censorship by DHS, CISA, and multiple other Federal \\\\nagencies.\\\\n    First, the Government is not the arbiter of truth. As \\\\nJustice Robert Jackson observed, the very purpose of the First \\\\nAmendment is to foreclose public authority from assuming a \\\\nguardianship of the public mind. Every person must be his own \\\\nwatchman for truth, because the forefathers did not trust any \\\\ngovernment to separate true from the false. During the COVID-19 \\\\npandemic, the Government proved unable to uphold truth. It \\\\npeddled falsehoods that natural immunity does not exist to \\\\nCOVID-19, that vaccine immunity is superior to natural \\\\nimmunity, and that vaccines would stop the transmission of the \\\\nvirus. The Government then suppressed dissenting voices on \\\\nTwitter, Facebook, and elsewhere who dared to express rational, \\\\nscientifically accurate views on COVID-19 and the vaccines.\\\\n    Second, the First Amendment protects even false speech. \\\\nMuch of the suppressed COVID speech was true, but in U.S. v. \\\\nAlvarez the Supreme Court held: False statements as a general \\\\nrule are not beyond Constitutional protection. Were the court \\\\nto hold that the interest in truthful discourse alone is \\\\nsufficient to sustain a ban on speech, it would give Government \\\\na broad sensorial power unprecedented in this court&#x27;s cases or \\\\nin our Constitutional tradition. This means labeling disfavored \\\\nspeech as misinformation, disinformation, or malformation does \\\\nnot strip it of First Amendment protection.\\\\n    Third, the Government may not do indirectly what the First \\\\nAmendment forbids it from doing directly. It is axiomatic, \\\\naccording to the Supreme Court, Norwood v. Harrison, 1973, that \\\\nthe Government may not induce, encourage, or promote private \\\\npersons to accomplish what it is Constitutionally forbidden to \\\\naccomplish. The bully pulpit does not include the power to \\\\nharangue social media platforms to remove the lawful speech of \\\\nthird parties. When the Government coerces or pressures a \\\\ncompany with threats, and the company responds by censoring \\\\nprivate individuals, that is unlawful state action. But if the \\\\nGovernment writes and tests software to effectively monitor and \\\\nshut down disfavored speech, and then turns that over to \\\\nprivate actors to run the software that censors the speech, \\\\nthat is also forbidden state action. It doesn&#x27;t matter that \\\\nit&#x27;s indirect. The First Amendment bar is much lower.\\\\n    Fourth, the First Amendment term abridging supplies the \\\\ntest to determine when the Government has violated the right to \\\\nfree speech. The only question for the courts is whether the \\\\nGovernment&#x27;s conduct has led to the abridging, that is the \\\\ndiminishing of speech. The test is not coercion, it is not \\\\nwhether something was compelled, it&#x27;s not pressure, it&#x27;s not \\\\nentanglement, it&#x27;s abridging. The First Amendment prohibits \\\\nGovernment from abridging speech, which contrasts with the \\\\nnarrower term prohibiting in the free exercise clause, as my \\\\nwritten testimony, citing Professor Hamburger, explains.\\\\n    I will close with three examples that illustrate the scope \\\\nof the problem with Government-led censorship through CISA \\\\nswitchboarding, and other practices. First, the Virality \\\\nProject flagged Harvard Medical School epidemiologist Martin \\\\nKulldorff&#x27;s tweet, which stated ``thinking that everyone must \\\\nbe vaccinated is as scientifically flawed as thinking that \\\\nnobody should. Covid vaccines are important for older, high-\\\\nrisk people and their caretakers. Those with prior natural \\\\ninfection do not need it, nor children.&#x27;&#x27; This tweet was \\\\ncensored and his account flagged.\\\\n    Second, the Virality Project wrote a report in which \\\\nanother NCLA client, Bri Dressen, was identified as a purveyor \\\\nof misinformation for discussing the adverse, devastating \\\\neffects she personally suffered from the AstraZeneca vaccine \\\\nafter she volunteered for a vaccine trial, even though NIH \\\\nitself had diagnosed her as vaccine-injured. In NCLA&#x27;s Dressen \\\\nv. Flaherty case, we are suing the Government for shutting down \\\\nBri&#x27;s support groups for vaccine-injured individuals. These are \\\\nprivate on-line groups where vaccine-injured people can turn \\\\nfor emotional support. When their support groups were deleted, \\\\ngroup members failed to get assistance they could have gotten \\\\nthat would have led to better treatments for them. At least one \\\\ncommitted suicide. This is private speech we&#x27;re talking about \\\\namong already-vaccinated people who want to converse with each \\\\nother and share their stories. They will not promote vaccine \\\\nhesitancy to the general public because the speech occurs in \\\\nprivate forums. And yet the Government is still suppressing \\\\nthat speech as we sit here. This is insanity.\\\\n    Third, White House pressure led the lab leak theory to be \\\\ncensored on social media. When Meta head of global affairs, \\\\nNick Clegg, asked a colleague why the story had been censored \\\\non Facebook, the colleague replied, ``because we were under \\\\npressure from the administration and others to do more&#x27;&#x27;, and \\\\nthat ``we shouldn&#x27;t have done it&#x27;&#x27;. Meta also acknowledged \\\\nchanging its policies regarding content discussing adverse \\\\nvaccine events to avoid retaliation from this White House.\\\\n    In some, these responses to dissenting COVID-19 views show \\\\nthe dangers of Government censorship. The Government&#x27;s conduct \\\\nviolated censored Americans First Amendment rights, as well as \\\\nthe rights of other Americans to listen and learn from those \\\\nperspectives and to draw their own conclusions about their \\\\nhealth, their vote, and the truth.\\\\n    This committee must force the Executive branch to correct \\\\ncourse before it completely obliterates the First Amendment.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Chenoweth follows:]\\\\n                  Prepared Statement of Mark Chenoweth\\\\n                           December 13, 2023\\\\n    Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the \\\\nsubcommittee, thank you for inviting my testimony.\\\\n                              introduction\\\\n    The New Civil Liberties Alliance is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil \\\\nrights organization founded by prominent legal scholar Philip \\\\nHamburger, the Maurice and Hilda Friedman Professor of Law at Columbia \\\\nLaw School in New York City, to protect Constitutional freedoms from \\\\nviolations by the administrative state. Professor Hamburger is among \\\\nthe Nation&#x27;s foremost First Amendment scholars, and his brilliant \\\\nscholarship informs the cases that NCLA pursues and the arguments that \\\\nNCLA makes in those cases on behalf of our clients. NCLA&#x27;s public-\\\\ninterest litigation and other pro bono advocacy strive to tame the \\\\nunlawful power of State and Federal agencies and to foster a new civil \\\\nliberties movement that will help restore Americans&#x27; fundamental \\\\nrights. NCLA views the administrative state as an especially serious \\\\nthreat to Constitutional freedoms. No other development in contemporary \\\\nAmerican law denies more rights to more Americans.\\\\n    The ``civil liberties&#x27;&#x27; of the organization&#x27;s name include rights \\\\nat least as old as the U.S. Constitution itself, such as freedom of \\\\nspeech, jury trial, due process of law, the right to be tried in front \\\\nof an impartial and independent judge, and the right to live under laws \\\\nmade by the Nation&#x27;s elected lawmakers through Constitutionally-\\\\nprescribed channels. Yet these selfsame rights are also very \\\\ncontemporary--and in dire need of renewed vindication--precisely \\\\nbecause Congress, Federal administrative agencies, and even sometimes \\\\nthe courts have neglected them for so long. NCLA aims to defend civil \\\\nliberties--primarily by asserting Constitutional constraints on the \\\\nadministrative state. Although Americans still enjoy the shell of their \\\\nRepublic, there has developed within it a very different sort of \\\\ngovernment--a type, in fact, that the Constitution was designed to \\\\nprevent. This un-Constitutional administrative state within the \\\\nConstitution&#x27;s United States is the focus of NCLA&#x27;s concern. NCLA urges \\\\nAmericans to recognize the administrative threat and join our civil \\\\nliberties movement against it.\\\\n    From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Civil Liberties \\\\nAlliance has been dismayed at the widespread and brazen violation of \\\\nAmericans&#x27; civil liberties by all levels of government in the United \\\\nStates. It&#x27;s as though officials think the U.S. Constitution does not \\\\napply in times of emergency when, in fact, it is during such times of \\\\ncrisis that the Constitution&#x27;s protections for individual rights are of \\\\nparamount importance. NCLA&#x27;s litigators have been at the forefront of \\\\nthe battles against illegal lockdowns, the unlawful Nation-wide \\\\neviction moratorium, and unconscionable vaccine mandates for university \\\\nemployees and students, Federal employees, Federal contractors, and \\\\nothers. Particularly with reference to vaccine mandates, NCLA adopted \\\\nthe position that natural immunity to COVID-19 is a real phenomenon and \\\\nthat vaccines are not necessarily appropriate--and certainly should not \\\\nbe mandated--for individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and have \\\\nantibodies against the virus, which can be measured through antibody \\\\ntesting. NCLA has also argued that Federal law prohibits forcing anyone \\\\noutside the military (and then only when ordered by the Commander-in-\\\\nChief) to take a vaccine that has only been approved under Emergency \\\\nUse Authorization. We have also argued that it is a fundamental \\\\nviolation of personal liberty to be forced to accept an experimental \\\\nvaccine as a condition of maintaining employment, especially public \\\\nemployment by a State or Federal agency or State university.\\\\n    In contrast, the Federal Government peddled the falsehoods that \\\\nnatural immunity does not exist to COVID-19, that vaccine immunity is \\\\nsuperior to natural immunity, that lockdowns were an effective \\\\nmitigation strategy, that everyone needs the vaccine, that the COVID-19 \\\\nvaccines would stop transmission of the virus, that masks are effective \\\\nin preventing transmission of the virus, that people hospitalized with \\\\nCOVID-19 need to be intubated, that EUA vaccines can be mandated for \\\\nFederal employees, that the Wuhan lab was not the origin of the COVID-\\\\n19 virus, and so forth. Eventually, the Federal Government came to its \\\\ncollective senses and backed away from propagating most of these \\\\nfalsehoods. It was forced to abandon some of them after courts ruled \\\\nagainst the Government. Some of them persist today. However, thanks in \\\\npart to NCLA&#x27;s efforts, at least the Government now admits that natural \\\\nimmunity to COVID-19 exists for some period of time among those who \\\\nhave recovered from the virus.\\\\n    To make matters worse, not only did the Federal Government peddle \\\\nfalsehoods during the pandemic, but it also suppressed dissenting \\\\nvoices in the public square on Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere, who \\\\ndared to express rational and scientifically accurate views about the \\\\nCOVID-19 virus and the vaccines authorized for emergency use in \\\\nresponse to it. And it did so in blatant violation of the First \\\\nAmendment. That is how NCLA first became aware of the vast and shocking \\\\ncensorship problem infecting the Federal Government today: our clients \\\\nwere censored for their views about COVID-19 and related issues.\\\\n    We can come back to that, but first let&#x27;s explore the legal \\\\nprinciples at stake here and the scope of the problem as it pertains to \\\\nthe Department of Homeland Security.\\\\n                            legal principles\\\\n    NCLA&#x27;s most prominent role to date in fighting against unlawful \\\\nFederal censorship has been through our participation representing the \\\\nindividual plaintiffs in the Missouri v. Biden case, now pending at the \\\\nU.S. Supreme Court under the name Murthy v. Missouri. The U.S. District \\\\nCourt for the Western District of Louisiana, which had the opportunity \\\\nto look at all of the (admittedly still limited) discovery in this case \\\\nbefore ruling, pronounced on the Fourth of July this year that ``the \\\\npresent case arguably involves the most massive attack against free \\\\nspeech in United States&#x27; history.&#x27;&#x27; ``Although this case is still \\\\nrelatively young, and at this stage the Court is only examining it in \\\\nterms of Plaintiffs&#x27; likelihood of success on the merits, the evidence \\\\nproduced thus far depicts an almost dystopian scenario. During the \\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, a period perhaps best characterized by widespread \\\\ndoubt and uncertainty, the U.S. Government seems to have assumed a role \\\\nsimilar to an Orwellian `Ministry of Truth.&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    On expedited appeal of that decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\\\nthe Fifth Circuit, after noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has been \\\\nreluctant to expand state-action doctrine, said: ``[W]e do not take our \\\\ndecision today lightly. But, the Supreme Court has rarely been faced \\\\nwith a coordinated campaign of this magnitude orchestrated by Federal \\\\nofficials that jeopardized a fundamental aspect of American life. \\\\nTherefore, the district court was correct in its assessment--\\\\n``unrelenting pressure&#x27;&#x27; from certain Government officials likely ``had \\\\nthe intended result of suppressing millions of protected free speech \\\\npostings by American citizens.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    As a reminder to this body, the First Amendment says, that \\\\n``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \\\\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of \\\\nspeech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to \\\\nassemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Under the First Amendment, ``government has no power to restrict \\\\nexpression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \\\\nits content.&#x27;&#x27; Ashcroft v. ACLU, 535 U.S. 564, 573 (2002). This \\\\n``profound&#x27;&#x27; commitment to free speech is even more necessary when the \\\\ndebate may include critical or sharp attacks on Government or its \\\\npolicies. See NY Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964). And, of \\\\ncourse, it is ``axiomatic&#x27;&#x27; that the Government may not ``induce, \\\\nencourage, or promote private persons to accomplish what it is \\\\nconstitutionally forbidden to accomplish.&#x27;&#x27; Norwood v. Harrison, 431 \\\\nU.S. 455, 465 (1973). So, just as the Fourth Amendment does not permit \\\\na police officer to ask a landlord to conduct an unconstitutional \\\\nsearch on behalf of that officer, so too the First Amendment does not \\\\npermit Government officials to use third-party companies or platforms \\\\nto censor lawful free speech indirectly that the Government itself \\\\nwould be prohibited from regulating directly. If anything, given the \\\\n`abridging&#x27; language, the First Amendment protects against such \\\\nmachinations even more than the Fourth Amendment.\\\\n    Again, the Government cannot do indirectly through third parties \\\\nwhat it cannot do directly. Congress must hold to that line. Otherwise, \\\\nfree speech is a dead letter, because the Executive branch has \\\\ncountless ways of influencing private parties to suppress their \\\\nspeech--as we have seen in Missouri v. Biden. Indeed, this kind of soft \\\\npower exercised through third parties may be worse in the sense that it \\\\nis harder to fight, harder to prove, and easier for the Government to \\\\nget away with. Indeed, I daresay there are some in this room--on both \\\\nsides of the aisle--who brush away the monumental efforts of the Biden \\\\nadministration to squelch speech on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and \\\\nother social media sites as merely the actions of private companies. \\\\nNot so. When the Government coerces or pressures a company with \\\\ninducements or threats and the company responds by crushing private \\\\nindividuals, that is State action, and the First Amendment forbids it. \\\\nOr when the Government has entangled its practices with a private \\\\ncompany to where the company is relying on the Government to identify \\\\nindividuals and accounts to be censored, the First Amendment forbids \\\\nthat too. Or, if the Government writes and tests software to \\\\neffectively monitor and shut down speech that the Government does not \\\\nlike and then turns that over to private operators to run the software \\\\nprogram and execute the censorship it identifies, that is still state \\\\naction.\\\\n    Is every person who was ever canceled on social media a victim of \\\\nstate action? Maybe not, but without discovery into the Government&#x27;s \\\\nunprecedented practices, NCLA and our co-counsel would never have \\\\nuncovered how wide-spread this practice has been and how far up the \\\\nchain of command it goes. We know the background level of censorship \\\\nthese companies engaged in before January 2021, especially Twitter \\\\ngiven the disclosures of the Twitter files. And we know what they did \\\\nin response to Government pressure in terms of ramping up the amount of \\\\ncensorship they were doing. So, there is plenty of evidence here to \\\\nascertain that this censorship was not conducted as independent, \\\\nprivate action.\\\\n    But even the Fifth Circuit&#x27;s test for Government action here is \\\\nflawed. We don&#x27;t need and should not invent a judicial standard for \\\\nadjudging infringements on free speech. The Constitution already \\\\nprovides the standard. The only question for the courts is whether the \\\\nGovernment&#x27;s conduct has led to the ``abridging&#x27;&#x27; of speech. That is \\\\nwhat the First Amendment&#x27;s text proscribes. Not coercion. Not pressure. \\\\nNot entanglement. Abridgment. And that is a very low bar. The First \\\\nAmendment prohibits Government from ``abridging&#x27;&#x27; freedom of speech \\\\n(contrasted with prohibited in the context of religion).\\\\n    The Bill of Rights&#x27; evolution demonstrates that the Framers \\\\npurposefully decided to use the term ``abridging&#x27;&#x27; which is a different \\\\nterm than ``prohibiting&#x27;&#x27; which is used in the Free Exercise Clause. \\\\nThis was not a mere attempt to create linguistic variety. See \\\\nHamburger, Courting Censorship,--COLUMBIA L. J at 39. An earlier draft \\\\nof what would become the First Amendment separated the guarantees to \\\\nfree exercise of religion and free speech into two adjacent paragraphs, \\\\nusing the term ``infringe&#x27;&#x27; to designate unlawful Government conduct in \\\\nboth contexts. Id. (citing House Committee Report (July 28, 1789), \\\\nCREATING THE BILL OF RIGHTS: THE DOCUMENTARY RECORD FROM THE FIRST \\\\nFEDERAL CONGRESS, 30 ed., Helen E. Veit, Kenneth R. Bowling, and \\\\nCharlene Bangs Bickford (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press 1991)). \\\\nThe two paragraphs were combined in a subsequent iteration, which used \\\\n``prohibit&#x27;&#x27; in the context of proscribed Government conduct with \\\\nrespect to free exercise of religion, and ``abridge&#x27;&#x27; for speech. Id.\\\\n    As Professor Hamburger writes: ``This contrast is revealing. An \\\\naction prohibiting is one that involves coercion--in the sense of \\\\ngovernment force or at least the threat of it. So, when the First \\\\nAmendment distinguishes abridging and prohibiting, it tells us \\\\nsomething important. A law can abridge the freedom of speech, or the \\\\npress, without prohibiting or otherwise coercively assaulting it.&#x27;&#x27; See \\\\nHamburger, Courting Censorship,--COLUMBIA L. J at 39. In other words, \\\\nthe Framers&#x27; conscious choice to use the terms ``abridging&#x27;&#x27; in the \\\\nspeech context and ``prohibiting&#x27;&#x27; in the religion context establishes \\\\nthat they sought to prevent Government from diminishing free speech to \\\\nany extent. That means any action that the Government takes to impede \\\\nfree speech violates the First Amendment. By contrast, when it comes to \\\\nreligion, the Government&#x27;s conduct must effectively ``forbid&#x27;&#x27; the free \\\\nexercise, a much more severe action and a higher bar to clear.\\\\n    Finally, in terms of legal principles, recognize that the Supreme \\\\nCourt has held that even ``false statements, as a general rule&#x27;&#x27; are \\\\nnot ``beyond Constitutional protection.&#x27;&#x27; United States v. Alvarez, 567 \\\\nU.S. 709, 718 (2012). Thus, merely labeling disfavored speech as \\\\n``disinformation,&#x27;&#x27; ``misinformation,&#x27;&#x27; or ``mal-information&#x27;&#x27; does not \\\\nstrip it of First Amendment protection. Of course even under the \\\\nGovernment&#x27;s own definitions, misinformation, disinformation, and \\\\nmalinformation are not necessarily false speech--often just \\\\ninconvenient or unpleasant truthful speech.\\\\n    But the court has explained that `` . . . some false statements are \\\\ninevitable if there is to be an open and vigorous expression of views \\\\nin public and private conversation, expression the First Amendment \\\\nseeks to guarantee.&#x27;&#x27; Id. (quoting United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. \\\\n460, 470 (2010)). ``Were the Court to hold that the interest in \\\\ntruthful discourse alone is sufficient to sustain a ban on speech . . . \\\\nit would give Government a broad censorial power unprecedented in this \\\\nCourt&#x27;s cases or in our Constitutional tradition. The mere potential \\\\nfor the exercise of that power casts a chill, a chill the First \\\\nAmendment cannot permit if free speech, thought, and discourse are to \\\\nremain a foundation of our freedom.&#x27;&#x27; Id. at 723.\\\\n    ``The theory of our Constitution is `that the best test of truth is \\\\nthe power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of \\\\nthe market.&#x27; &#x27;&#x27; Id. at 728 (quoting Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. \\\\n616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting)). ``The First Amendment itself \\\\nensures the right to respond to speech we do not like, and for good \\\\nreason. Freedom of Speech and thought flows [sic] not from the \\\\nbeneficence of the state but from the inalienable rights of the person. \\\\nAnd suppression of speech by the government can make exposure of \\\\nfalsity more difficult, not less so. Society has the right and civic \\\\nduty to engage in open, dynamic, rational discourse. These ends are not \\\\nwell served when the Government seeks to orchestrate public discussion \\\\nthrough content-based mandates.&#x27;&#x27; Id. at 728.\\\\n                       background on cisa and dhs\\\\n    Founded in 2018, CISA, a component of DHS, was initially created to \\\\nprotect ``critical infrastructure&#x27;&#x27; (information technology, \\\\ntelecommunications, chemical, transportation systems, emergency \\\\nservices, postal and shipping) from cybersecurity threats.\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\ It \\\\nrapidly expanded its mission to combat foreign ``disinformation.&#x27;&#x27; See, \\\\ne.g., CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SEC.

Biden litigation are Dr. Jay \\\\nBhattacharya, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, and Ms. Jill \\\\nHines. Their speech has revolved around the extent to which the \\\\nGovernment&#x27;s public health and public policy advice about COVID-19 is \\\\nsound. Drs. Bhattacharya and Kulldorff were co-authors and signatories \\\\nto the Great Barrington Declaration. They opposed lockdowns. Other \\\\nspeech included efforts to say that natural immunity is real, efforts \\\\nto say that not every category of the populace needs the vaccine, \\\\nefforts to oppose forced vaccination, efforts to say that natural \\\\nimmunity provides equal or greater protection than the vaccine.\\\\n    Note that several examples of suppressed speech were neither \\\\nmisinformation, disinformation, nor even malinformation. Indeed, the \\\\nGovernment now admits that natural immunity exists and is effective \\\\nagainst reinfection with COVID-19 for at least as long as the vaccine, \\\\nthough the Government still wants those folks vaccinated, saying that \\\\nthere is some marginal benefit to them. Note as well that several of \\\\nthe Government&#x27;s false narratives were allowed to propagate widely on \\\\nsocial media unrefuted. For example, the narrative against natural \\\\nimmunity and the narrative refuting that the Wuhan Institute of \\\\nVirology was the source of the virus (via a leak from the lab) \\\\npersisted.\\\\n    We have only been able to obtain limited discovery in the Murthy v. \\\\nMissouri case because we are still at the preliminary injunction phase \\\\nof litigation. The Supreme Court may or may not decide that we have \\\\nenough discovery to establish connections to the extent its precedents \\\\nwill demand. That is in part because the Court might demand a coercion \\\\nor significant encouragement standard that is higher than the \\\\n``abridging&#x27;&#x27; standard set by the First Amendment itself. Such a \\\\nstandard would not be consistent with either the text of the First \\\\nAmendment or jurisprudence in the area, and it would have disastrous, \\\\nbroad implications for Americans&#x27; First Amendment speech rights.\\\\n    If these plaintiffs are unable to succeed, it is hard to envision \\\\nhow future litigants will do so. Consider first that in this case there \\\\nwas a district court judge who was willing to order a modicum of pre-\\\\ninjunction discovery. Second, we were able to turn up a fair bit of \\\\ngood discovery and identify at least some of the correct Government \\\\nofficials to seek information from--though the Government lied to us \\\\nabout the scope and identity of relevant officials. Third, we \\\\ndiscovered this dishonesty because we also obtained third-party \\\\ndiscovery from Facebook, which turned over dozens more emails and \\\\nsimilar communications with Government officials that the Government&#x27;s \\\\ninitial response to discovery had omitted. Fourth, we also were able to \\\\nrely on the Twitter Files to some extent to find examples of \\\\ncensorship. That material only became available because Elon Musk \\\\nbought Twitter and for no other reason. Fifth, we were able to rely on \\\\nthe investigative journalism work of Michael Shellenberger, Matt \\\\nTaibbi, and others, who combed through the Twitter files and made some \\\\nrelevant information public. Finally, Congress used its oversight \\\\ncapacity to issue subpoenas that turned up some additional information. \\\\nThis came rather late in the game, so it has not been as beneficial as \\\\nit would have been if it had come earlier, but it is still useful to \\\\nhave.\\\\n    To see how difficult these cases are to bring and win, consider \\\\nthat NCLA already lost a very similar case at the circuit court level, \\\\nwhich we are still appealing. In the Sixth Circuit, we filed suit on \\\\nbehalf of three clients--Mark Changizi, Michael Senger, and Daniel \\\\nKotzin--whose messages were taken down from Twitter and in one instance \\\\nour client was kicked off Twitter entirely. But the panel ruled against \\\\nour clients on standing, saying that they could not trace their harm to \\\\nGovernment conduct. In other words, the complaint supposedly did not \\\\nstate enough facts to meet the bare minimum necessary to allege \\\\nGovernment wrongdoing.\\\\n    The district court in that case had denied us any discovery. The \\\\nCourt of Appeals then limited itself to the facts in the complaint, \\\\neven though many more facts had come out by the time of the briefing on \\\\nappeal and the oral argument. The Sixth Circuit, without reaching the \\\\nmerits of the First Amendment issues in the case, held that we had not \\\\nmet the minimum pleading standards to even survive a motion to dismiss.\\\\n    The court also said that our allegations against the Government \\\\nwere--and I quote--``not phantasmagoric&#x27;&#x27; which is a funny thing to say \\\\nsince all of our allegations were facts provable and proved from \\\\ndiscovery obtained (albeit later) in the Missouri v. Biden litigation. \\\\nYet that was not enough for a panel in the Sixth circuit to even allow \\\\nour clients to survive a motion to dismiss. Under such circumstances, \\\\nwhere courts are willing to put blinders on to well-established facts, \\\\nit is hard to see how other plaintiffs will be able to make any headway \\\\nagainst Government censorship. Under this standard, most people being \\\\ncensored would never be able to plead their allegations with the degree \\\\nof specificity apparently required to survive a motion to dismiss.\\\\n    Several of the modes of censorship used against our clients are \\\\nsurreptitious; that is, our clients did not even know they were being \\\\ncensored in some cases or on some platforms for a long time. They \\\\ncertainly were unaware of the Government&#x27;s insidious involvement in \\\\ntheir censorship, which for the most part was conducted via backdoor \\\\nchannels, behind closed doors. Thus, the Government has been able to \\\\nevade democratic accountability for Federal conduct that violates core \\\\nFirst Amendment-protected activity. You may wonder how extensive this \\\\ncensorship has really been. If so, recognize that information taken \\\\ndown has included: (1) known and open parody accounts; (2) information \\\\nposted by experts from the Nation&#x27;s top medical schools and \\\\nuniversities; (3) In our Dressen v. Flaherty case, the Government \\\\nstooped so low as to shut down support groups for vaccine-injured \\\\nindividuals. These are the equivalent of cancer support groups, private \\\\non-line groups where people can go for emotional support. Some people \\\\nkicked off of these platforms have committed suicide and/or failed to \\\\nget assistance (or failed to learn of better medical protocols) that \\\\ncould have led to better outcomes for them sooner. The Government wants \\\\npeople&#x27;s personal reports of their own symptoms and experience, the \\\\nmost personal of truths, taken down. This is essentially private speech \\\\namong people who want to engage in consensual speech with each other \\\\n(i.e., conversation), and it is speech occurring among already-\\\\nvaccinated people who in reality had no chance of promoting vaccine \\\\nhesitancy to the general public because the speech occurred in private \\\\nforums. And yet even that was taken down. This is censorship to the nth \\\\ndegree.\\\\n                            recommendations\\\\n    In considering solutions to the Federal censorship conduct problems \\\\nat DHS, CISA, and across the Federal Government, Congress needs to \\\\nrealize that there is very little recognition among the offending \\\\nofficials that they are blatantly violating the First Amendment. About \\\\nthe only recognition comes in those places where officials (mistakenly) \\\\nseem to think that orchestrating censorship through third parties \\\\nsomehow insulates it from violating the First Amendment. Keeping that \\\\nin mind, Congress should demand better education of front-line \\\\nExecutive branch officials about their Constitutional obligations and \\\\nresponsibilities. These officials who requested the takedown of lawful \\\\nspeech had an independent duty to uphold the First Amendment, which \\\\nthey ignored.\\\\n    (1) If this censorship were being done by State officials, \\\\n        censorship victims could sue under Sec. 1983 for deprivation of \\\\n        their civil rights. Congress could create a Federal cause of \\\\n        action akin to Sec. 1983 for victims of censorship to sue \\\\n        Federal officials who violate their First Amendment rights.\\\\n    (2) Congress should outright forbid anyone in the Executive branch \\\\n        or Legislative branch from ever requesting lawful speech to be \\\\n        taken down.\\\\n    (3) Where the Federal Government decides to request speech to be \\\\n        taken down, because it is unlawful speech--and NOT just because \\\\n        it violates a platform&#x27;s internal policies--those requests \\\\n        should only be made where they are transparent, immediately \\\\n        public, and made by a named individual in the Federal \\\\n        Government who can be held responsible for that decision by \\\\n        Congress and the censored individual(s).\\\\n                               conclusion\\\\n    The censorship discussed here involved many topics, including \\\\nelection-related speech like the Hunter Biden laptop and climate \\\\nchange-related speech. The last of these was not part of the \\\\npreliminary injunction as discovery was not taken at the preliminary \\\\ninjunction stage to support the complaint&#x27;s claims on that topic. \\\\nStill, the debate over nearly all things related to COVID-19 provides a \\\\nperfect case study for Americans to realize the danger that exists when \\\\nthe Government pushes for the censorship of dissenting views. Without \\\\nthe Government&#x27;s participation, it is doubtful that the media would \\\\nhave uniformly censored those stories, and the censorship gravely \\\\ninjured Americans&#x27; ability to make important decisions regarding their \\\\nhealth and the health of their families. We have evidence, in the form \\\\nof email exchanges, that the social media companies were caving to \\\\npressure from Government when they censored certain topics. For \\\\ninstance, as the Facebook Files demonstrated, the lab leak theory was \\\\ncensored on social media due to pressure from the White House. Meta \\\\nHead of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, asked a colleague in charge of \\\\ncontent policy why the story had been censored, and the colleague \\\\nresponded, ``Because we were under pressure from the [Biden] \\\\nadministration and others to do more&#x27;&#x27; and that ``we shouldn&#x27;t have \\\\ndone it.&#x27;&#x27; Meta acknowledged changing its policies regarding content \\\\ndiscussing adverse events of the vaccine to avoid retaliation from the \\\\nWhite House.\\\\n    This is conduct that violates the First Amendment rights of \\\\ncensored Americans--as well as the rights of every other American to \\\\nlisten to and learn from those censored perspectives to draw their own \\\\nconclusions about the truth. As Justice Robert Jackson famously said in \\\\nthe West Virginia v. Barnette case: ``If there is any fixed star in our \\\\nConstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, \\\\ncan prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, \\\\nreligion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by \\\\nword or act their faith therein.&#x27;&#x27; West Virginia State Board of \\\\nEducation v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943).\\\\n    Less famously, as Justice Jackson noted 2 years later in Thomas v. \\\\nCollins, ``The very purpose of the First Amendment is to foreclose \\\\npublic authority from assuming a guardianship of the public mind \\\\nthrough regulating the press, speech, and religion. In this field, \\\\nevery person must be his own watchman for truth, because the \\\\nforefathers did not trust any government to separate the true from the \\\\nfalse for us.&#x27;&#x27; Today&#x27;s Federal Government has strayed far from this \\\\nwise and Constitutionally-required path. I hope that this committee \\\\nwill ensure that the Executive branch corrects course.*\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    *[Note.--Due to length, the witnesses&#x27; supporting documents have \\\\nbeen retained in committee files.]\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chenoweth. I now recognize \\\\nMr. Abdo for his 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n   STATEMENT OF ALEX ABDO, LITIGATION DIRECTOR, KNIGHT FIRST \\\\n            AMENDMENT INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Abdo. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members \\\\nof the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    My name is Alex Abdo, and I&#x27;m the litigation director of \\\\nthe Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \\\\nThe topic that this subcommittee has been exploring on the \\\\nrelationship between Government and social media platforms is \\\\nan important one, in large part because it implicates many \\\\ncompeting First Amendment interests. I&#x27;d like to offer several \\\\nobservations to clarify the Constitutional principles that \\\\nshould guide this subcommittee&#x27;s work.\\\\n    First, as the Supreme Court held 60 years ago in Bantam \\\\nBooks v. Sullivan, the First Amendment forbids the Government \\\\nfrom coercing private actors into silencing disfavored speech. \\\\nThat decision was correct because coercion, by definition, \\\\noverrides the ability of people to decide for themselves what \\\\nto say, what to listen to, and what communities to join. This \\\\nrule is important not only in protecting individuals, but also \\\\nin protecting the social media platforms, which now play a \\\\nvital role in hosting and curating the speech of millions of \\\\npeople. The communities they create reflect their own \\\\nexpressive decisions, as well as the expressive and \\\\nassociational preferences of their users. Outside of very \\\\nnarrow exceptions, it would be inconsistent with the principle \\\\nof self-government to allow officials to dictate the speech \\\\nindividuals may create and consume in these on-line \\\\ncommunities, whether directly through official sanction or \\\\nindirectly through official coercion.\\\\n    Second, while the First Amendment forbids the Government \\\\nfrom coercing private actors into suppressing speech, it does \\\\nnot preclude the Government from trying to persuade private \\\\nactors to embrace its views. A democratically-elected \\\\ngovernment must have the power to govern, and an indispensable \\\\ntool in governing is attempting to galvanize public opinion. As \\\\nthe Supreme Court reaffirmed just a few years ago, governing \\\\nnecessarily involves taking a particular viewpoint and \\\\nrejecting others. It is not easy to imagine, the court wrote, \\\\nhow government could function if it could not express its \\\\nviews. The public also has a strong interest in hearing what \\\\nits government has to say. Hearing the Government&#x27;s views helps \\\\nordinary citizens evaluate the Government&#x27;s decisions and hold \\\\nGovernment officials accountable for them. In addition, private \\\\nactors often rely on the Government&#x27;s expertise in making \\\\ndecisions about their own speech.\\\\n    In the years after 9/11, for example, news organizations \\\\nwelcomed the input of the Government in deciding whether to \\\\npublish Classified information that had been leaked to them. \\\\nThis is not to say, of course, that anyone should defer to the \\\\nGovernment&#x27;s views, knowledge, or expertise. The Government \\\\noften gets things wrong. But a rule requiring the Government to \\\\nstand silent on matters of public policy would be paralyzing, \\\\nas the Supreme Court has said.\\\\n    Third, and this is a point I really want to emphasize \\\\ntoday, the First Amendment protects the right of researchers to \\\\nstudy social media platforms and to share their findings with \\\\nthe public, the platforms, and the Government. It should not \\\\nneed to be said that when researchers study the social media \\\\nplatforms, they are exercising rights protected by the First \\\\nAmendment. When they criticize the platform&#x27;s content \\\\nmoderation policies and practices, the First Amendment protects \\\\nthem. When they press the platforms to take down speech, the \\\\nFirst Amendment protects them. Yes, even when you and I \\\\ndisagree with their research findings and proposals, the First \\\\nAmendment protects them. For these reasons, I think it&#x27;s \\\\ncrucial for the subcommittee to tread carefully in this area. \\\\nIt&#x27;s legitimate to investigate the Executive branch to see \\\\nwhether it has coerced or conspired with researchers to \\\\nsuppress protected speech, but investigations of and lawsuits \\\\nagainst private researchers who acted independently of the \\\\nGovernment are not a defense of the First Amendment. They are a \\\\ngrave threat to it.\\\\n    Finally, let me conclude by acknowledging what I hope is a \\\\ncommon concern. The concentration of private power over public \\\\ndiscourse is a threat to free speech. The First Amendment does \\\\nnot forbid the social media companies from assuming gatekeeper \\\\ncontrol over public discourse, nor does it insulate them, \\\\nhowever, from careful regulation that would loosen that \\\\ncontrol. Congress can and should pass legislation that would do \\\\njust that. It should require the platforms to design their \\\\nsystems to be interoperable so that users can switch to \\\\ncompeting services without losing their social networks. It \\\\nshould enact a privacy law that gives users greater control \\\\nover their personal data, making it easier for users to switch \\\\nbetween competing services and harder for platforms to obtain \\\\nand monopolize access to the data that drives their \\\\nprofitability. Congress should enact transparency laws that \\\\nmake it easier to study the platforms and the effects they&#x27;re \\\\nhaving on public discourse. Carefully-drafted laws of this kind \\\\nwould address some of the legitimate concerns with the \\\\nplatforms consistently with the First Amendment.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Abdo follows:]\\\\n                    Prepared Statement of Alex Abdo\\\\n                           December 13, 2023\\\\n    Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the \\\\nsubcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify today.

It should enact a privacy law \\\\nthat gives users greater control over their personal data, making it \\\\neasier for users to switch between competing services and harder for \\\\nplatforms to obtain and monopolize access to the data that drives their \\\\nprofitability. And Congress should enact transparency laws that make it \\\\neasier to study the platforms and the effects they&#x27;re having on public \\\\ndiscourse.\\\\n    Carefully drafted laws of this kind would address some of the \\\\nlegitimate concerns with the platforms, consistently with the First \\\\nAmendment.\\\\n    Thank you, again, for the opportunity to testify today.\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Bishop.

LAWKOWSKI, SENIOR FELLOW, THE COUNCIL TO \\\\n                      MODERNIZE GOVERNANCE\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Lawkowski. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, Members of \\\\nthe committee, thank you very much for this opportunity to \\\\ntestify today.\\\\n    My name is Gary Lawkowski. I&#x27;m a senior fellow with the \\\\ncouncil to modernize governance. I&#x27;d like to begin with a \\\\nlittle bit of a story. For about the last 2 years or so, I&#x27;ve \\\\nhad the distinct pleasure of dating a lovely woman who lives up \\\\nin Baltimore, Maryland. Now, I live in Virginia. If you&#x27;ve ever \\\\nmade that drive, that can be a bit of a challenge. Sometimes \\\\nyou&#x27;re going up and down the GW Parkway, back and forth between \\\\nVirginia and Baltimore. I&#x27;ve been doing that a lot over the \\\\npast 2 years, and I have got to tell you, when I&#x27;m driving down \\\\nthat road, there are all these crazy people going down there. \\\\nIf it&#x27;s not someone zipping past me on the right, it&#x27;s someone \\\\nplodding along in the left, blocking up traffic. It drives me \\\\ncrazy. There are all these other maniacs out there on the road. \\\\nSomeone really should do something about that. But the problem \\\\nis, to me, regulating disinformation is a lot like regulating \\\\ndriving. I suspect if you took those other people, sat them in \\\\nthis chair, stood them up, have them raise their right hand, \\\\nand make the same oath who swear to tell the truth, they would \\\\nalso say, hey, it&#x27;s that crazy guy with those Virginia tags out \\\\nthere. He&#x27;s the one who doesn&#x27;t know how to drive, not me. In \\\\nthe words of the sage of our time, Taylor Swift, sometimes, \\\\nmaybe, though, it&#x27;s me. Hi, I&#x27;m the problem. It&#x27;s me. We all \\\\nthink we&#x27;re good drivers, but it turns out we may well be the \\\\nmaniac. That&#x27;s why we need to approach these issues with a fair \\\\ndegree of humility and recognize that we may not be the ones \\\\nwho know what&#x27;s true, we may be the one who&#x27;s wrong. That&#x27;s why \\\\nregulating disinformation, misinformation, these other things, \\\\nis so dangerous, because it sort-of presumes this position that \\\\nwe&#x27;re always right and that we can always get the answer right. \\\\nThat&#x27;s particularly dangerous when it&#x27;s coming from Government.\\\\n    So we&#x27;ve heard some talk already about what are the limits \\\\nfrom the First Amendment and kind-of how far can we go with \\\\nthat, as though the First Amendment itself is kind-of the end-\\\\nall, be-all of this. While the First Amendment is incredibly \\\\nimportant, I think it&#x27;s even more important to look kind-of \\\\nbehind that and why we have a first amendment. Why do we care \\\\nabout this, why is this something that&#x27;s in our Constitution? \\\\nWhy do we prioritize free expression at all?\\\\n    So, first and foremost, free expression, including, and \\\\nperhaps especially the expression of ideas that most people \\\\nthink are wrong, people may think that person&#x27;s a maniac, \\\\nthey&#x27;re important, and they&#x27;re necessary in the search for \\\\ntruth. Pursuing truth requires correcting errors, and that \\\\nmeans standing up against prevailing narratives and standing up \\\\nagainst what seemed to be consensus. Otherwise, we&#x27;d be locked \\\\ninto antiquated ideas. To take this kind-of one example, I grew \\\\nup, I was a child in the 1990&#x27;s. We had this food pyramid from \\\\nthe Department of Agriculture. That was the end-all, be-all of \\\\nhealthy eating. If you follow this, you&#x27;ll stay healthy, you&#x27;ll \\\\nbe in good shape. So I took that as the settled science. Well, \\\\nit turns out since that time, it&#x27;s been updated at least twice \\\\nby the Department of Agriculture. It&#x27;s also been called into \\\\nquestion by numerous public health schools, such as the Harvard \\\\nPublic Health School. What we thought was true may have been \\\\nwrong, even about something as elemental as eating, something \\\\nthat people have to do, have been doing as long as there have \\\\nbeen people. We may still get that information wrong. This is \\\\none reason we need to tread very carefully around the free \\\\nexpression, because it allows us to correct these consensus, \\\\npurportedly settled ideas when it turns out they may be wrong.\\\\n    A second thing, free expression sort-of lowers the \\\\ntemperature and the stakes for political contests. It&#x27;s one \\\\nthing if I&#x27;m wrong and you&#x27;re right and I lose, then I can \\\\nlitigate that in the next election, I can litigate that at \\\\nanother opportunity. If I think I&#x27;m right and you think you&#x27;re \\\\nright, and whoever wins gets to shut the other person up, \\\\nthat&#x27;s a big problem. That really raises the stakes in our \\\\npolitical contests, because now it&#x27;s no longer about coming \\\\nback in the next election, now it&#x27;s about this is the thing \\\\nthat settles this issue for all time. That&#x27;s a huge problem, \\\\nparticularly at a time where there&#x27;s already concern about \\\\npolitical polarization.\\\\n    Third, free expression provides a window into what people \\\\nbelieve. Just because we tell people they can&#x27;t say something \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t mean they stop believing that. They still do, they just \\\\nbecome much more careful or much more discerning about who \\\\nthey&#x27;re going to express those views to. Thus, bad ideas don&#x27;t \\\\nreally go away just because you censor them, they just go \\\\nunderground, and that&#x27;s not healthy for our society.\\\\n    Then fourth, and perhaps most fundamentally, one of the \\\\nproblems with regulating this sort of mis- and disinformation \\\\ngets back to that driving question. It&#x27;s who decides? I would \\\\nsay the Government is the last person you want making those \\\\ndecisions because it&#x27;s the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Even \\\\nif they don&#x27;t say do this or else, there&#x27;s always that implicit \\\\nor else in what Government&#x27;s doing.\\\\n    So what do we do about this? How do we go beyond just the \\\\nfour corners of the First Amendment to protect our rights going \\\\nforward? First, we have to return to first principles. The \\\\nFederal Government, particularly the Executive branch, should \\\\nnot be the arbiter of truth.\\\\n    Second of all, there should be bright lines protecting and \\\\npreventing the Federal Government from interfering with \\\\nConstitutionally-protected speech. In very limited \\\\ncircumstances that have been recognized by the court there may \\\\nbe a place to step in like child pornography, imminent threats. \\\\nIn other places, though, the Government really shouldn&#x27;t be \\\\nstepping in to try to tell people what they can and can&#x27;t say \\\\non-line.\\\\n    Third, domestic-facing agencies, particularly the \\\\nDepartment of Homeland Security, really should not be involved \\\\nin this. This is not to absolve other agencies of \\\\nresponsibility, but it is to say that these agencies&#x27; goal and \\\\ntheir main target audience is American citizens, and American \\\\ncitizens should not be restricted by their Government on what \\\\nthey can and can&#x27;t say.\\\\n    Fourth, there&#x27;s a slippery slope in the definitional \\\\nchanges that we&#x27;ve seen, and I believe that will be talked \\\\nabout a little more, about this idea that we&#x27;ve gone from \\\\ncritical infrastructure as physical things to cognitive \\\\ninfrastructure and the idea that we have to regulate ideas. \\\\nThat should not happen without, at very least, of a robust \\\\npublic debate. That has not happened.\\\\n    Fifth, the Government should cut Federal funding for anti-\\\\ndisinformation programs to seek, deflect, and censor First \\\\nAmendment projects. It&#x27;s one thing to say these are private \\\\ninstitutions, but it&#x27;s another thing when they&#x27;re being funded \\\\nwith our tax dollars.\\\\n    Finally, there must be avenues for personal accountability \\\\nfor people who do this.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Lawkowski follows:]\\\\n                Prepared Statement of Gary M. Lawkowski\\\\n                           December 13, 2023\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and Members of the committee, \\\\nthank you for this opportunity to testify today.\\\\n                          i. introduction \\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\ Portions of this testimony are adopted from the Council to \\\\nModernize Governance report, Restoring Online Free Speech and Shutting \\\\nDown the Censorship Industrial Complex, which is attached hereto. See \\\\nCurtis Schube &amp; Gary Lawkowski, Restoring Online Free Speech and \\\\nShutting Down the Censorship Industrial Complex, The Council to \\\\nModernize Governance (Dec. 2023).\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    For about the past 2 years, I have had the distinct pleasure of \\\\ndating a lovely woman. But there is a catch: I live in the great \\\\nCommonwealth of Virginia, while she lives across the river and up the \\\\nroad in Baltimore, Maryland. This means I have spent a lot of time over \\\\nthe past 2 years going up and down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, I-\\\\n295, and I-395.\\\\n    I started driving in high school. I have been doing it for a while. \\\\nI think I have become pretty good at it. But something seems to happen \\\\nas soon as I cross the river on the highway. If you have had the \\\\nopportunity to make this trip a few times, you may have seen it as \\\\nwell. There are all these maniacs on the road. If they are not zipping \\\\npast me at unsafe speeds on the right, they are plodding along blocking \\\\ntraffic on the left.\\\\n    But here is the amazing thing: I suspect if you tracked down those \\\\nother drivers, sat them in this chair, and swore them to tell the \\\\ntruth, they would tell you that they are not the problem. It is \\\\neveryone else, maybe even me, that guy with the Virginia tags.\\\\n    I apologize if you have heard this one before,\\\\\\\\2\\\\\\\\ but to me, \\\\n``disinformation&#x27;&#x27; is a lot like driving. We all think we are good at \\\\nidentifying what is true, that the problem is everyone else, and that \\\\nthings would be so much better if we could just make them see that. \\\\nBut, in the words of Time Magazine&#x27;s illustrious person of the year, it \\\\nmay be that ``it&#x27;s me, hi, I&#x27;m the problem, it&#x27;s me&#x27;&#x27;\\\\\\\\3\\\\\\\\--we all may \\\\nwell be the maniac on the road.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\2\\\\\\\\ See Testimony of Mr. Gary M. Lawkowski, Senior Fellow, the \\\\nInstitute for Free Speech to the U.S. House of Representatives \\\\nCommittee on House Administration, Subcommittee on Elections (June 22, \\\\n2022), https://docs.house.gov/meetings/HA/HA08/20220622/114910/HHRG-\\\\n117-HA08-WState-LawkowskiG-20220622.pdf.\\\\n    \\\\\\\\3\\\\\\\\ Taylor Swift &amp; Jack Antonoff, Anti-Hero, Republic (Oct. 21, \\\\n2022), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1kbLwvqugk..\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    The result is that it is imperative to approach questions of truth \\\\nwith a healthy dose of humility. Whether it is done directly or \\\\nindirectly, censorship or seeking to suppress perceived ``dis-,&#x27;&#x27; \\\\n``mis-,&#x27;&#x27; or ``malinformation&#x27;&#x27; takes the opposite approach.\\\\n    Unfortunately, over the past few years, Government officials have \\\\nassumed increasingly assertive roles in attempting to police truth and \\\\nfalsity in public discourse, particularly on-line. The search for truth \\\\nand the basic imperatives of self-government require breathing space in \\\\na free and open marketplace of ideas.\\\\\\\\4\\\\\\\\ This is completely \\\\nincompatible with constant ``content moderation&#x27;&#x27; to strangle purported \\\\n``misinformation.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\4\\\\\\\\ See generally New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, \\\\n271-72 (1964) (Recognizing ``[t]hat erroneous statement is inevitable \\\\nin free debate, and that it must be protected if the freedoms of \\\\nexpression are to have the `breathing space&#x27; that they `need . . . to \\\\nsurvive.&#x27; &#x27;&#x27; (quoting N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433 (1963)).\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    Preserving and protecting this marketplace of ideas requires going \\\\nbeyond just the four corners of the First Amendment and restoring \\\\ninstitutional respect for the values it protects. This involves actions \\\\nin the courts, but it also requires administrative and legislative \\\\naction to ensure Government--including domestic-facing agencies like \\\\nthe Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of \\\\nInvestigation--respect proper limits on their actions.\\\\n                        ii. why free expression\\\\n    ``Disinformation&#x27;&#x27; and ``misinformation&#x27;&#x27; are real. There are bad \\\\nactors who want to intentionally spread false information to serve \\\\ntheir own ends. There are also people who honestly believe things that \\\\njust are not true. Moreover, whether intentional or not, this false \\\\ninformation can have real, negative consequences: from luring speakers \\\\ninto minor faux paus to potentially starting wars.\\\\n    In light of these threats, why do we value and prioritize the free \\\\nexpression of ideas--especially ideas that seem like they are wrong?\\\\n    First and foremost, free expression--including and perhaps \\\\nespecially the expression of ideas that many people believe are wrong--\\\\nis necessary in the search for truth. Knowledge is not static. People \\\\nand institutions constantly learn new information or make mistakes in \\\\nhow they analyze old information. Pursuing truth requires correcting \\\\nerrors in prevailing narratives, which in turn means people must be \\\\nfree to challenge prevailing orthodoxy and beliefs.\\\\n    I grew up and went to school in the 1990&#x27;s. When I was in school, \\\\nwe were taught about the food pyramid, the paragon of guidance for \\\\nhealthy eating. Considering the primacy placed on the food pyramid as \\\\n``settled science&#x27;&#x27;--at least for us elementary schoolers--it came as \\\\nquite a surprise for me to learn that the U.S. Department of \\\\nAgriculture has changed its recommended guidance graphic at least twice \\\\nsince the early 1990&#x27;s, each time altering its guidance for healthy \\\\neating.\\\\\\\\5\\\\\\\\ Even after these changes, the current recommendations are \\\\nstill contentious and hotly debated. For example, the Harvard T.H. Chan \\\\nSchool of Public Health almost immediately launched its own ``Healthy \\\\nEating Plate&#x27;&#x27; as an alternative to the Department of Agriculture&#x27;s \\\\nrevised recommendations.\\\\\\\\6\\\\\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\5\\\\\\\\ See William Neuman, Nutrition Plate Unveiled, Replacing Food \\\\nPyramid, N.Y. Times (June 2, 2011), https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/\\\\nbusiness/03plate.html.\\\\n    \\\\\\\\6\\\\\\\\ See Harvard researchers launch Healthy Eating Plate, Harvard \\\\nT.H. Chan School of Public Health (Sept. 14, 2011), https://\\\\nwww.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/healthy-eating-plate/.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    Eating food is one of the basic building blocks of life. Humans \\\\nhave been doing it since they first appeared on the Earth. Yet, we \\\\nstill do not fully understand or agree on what type of diet is best and \\\\nhow to describe it. Even in a field so basic and longstanding, the \\\\n``science&#x27;&#x27; is not so ``settled&#x27;&#x27; as to be beyond debate. There is \\\\nevery reason to believe that questions that have arisen much more \\\\nrecently and that are much less elemental to the human experience can \\\\nalso benefit from a continued airing of debate and contrasting views.\\\\n    Second, free expression lowers the stakes for political contests. \\\\nOur Constitution was drafted in 1787. The framers were well aware of \\\\nthe recent history of approximately 200 years of European wars of \\\\nreligion and, particularly, the history of the English Civil War, which \\\\nended a little over a century before. While there were many factors \\\\ninfluencing each conflict, one recurring theme was the steadfast idea \\\\nthat one side knew the truth and was right, while the other side did \\\\nnot and was wrong.\\\\n    The settlement, reflected in the ideals of the founders&#x27; age, was \\\\nto accept that one side could be wrong without needing to change their \\\\nmind at the point of a sword. This is a principle that is being \\\\nincreasingly devalued in our political culture and it is one we \\\\ndisregard at our own peril. Recognizing the right to be wrong lowers \\\\nthe stakes of our political disputes. It allows the losing side in \\\\ntoday&#x27;s political debate to accept defeat gracefully, rather than \\\\nviewing any setback as an existential threat.\\\\n    Third, free expression provides a window into what people believe. \\\\nPeople do not necessarily stop believing the ``wrong&#x27;&#x27; things just \\\\nbecause they are not able to express them. They simply get more careful \\\\nabout when and with whom they choose to express their true views. Thus, \\\\n``bad&#x27;&#x27; ideas do not go away; they go underground. This is not a \\\\nhealthy state of affairs.\\\\n iii. the problem with regulating dis-, mis-, and malinformation--who \\\\n                                decides?\\\\n    The problem with regulating purported ``mis-,&#x27;&#x27; ``dis-,&#x27;&#x27; or \\\\n``malinformation&#x27;&#x27; boils down to a simple question: who decides? \\\\nRegulating these categories of speech requires someone to first \\\\ndetermine what is and what is not true. This is an incredibly \\\\nconsequential power.\\\\n    In a free society, where Government derives its authority from the \\\\nconsent of the governed, the answer to this question cannot be the \\\\nGovernment. Government--especially the Federal Government--is an 800-\\\\npound gorilla. It wields vast power over individuals, companies, and \\\\nthe economy more broadly. If my neighbor thinks I am wrong, I can \\\\nignore his views. If the Government thinks I am wrong and has the \\\\nauthority to impose its view of truth, I do not have the same luxury.\\\\n    Moreover, government is ultimately a human institution. Even though \\\\nthe majority of government employees are dedicated to their work and \\\\nwant to do the right thing, they are still susceptible to the same \\\\nflaws, cognitive biases, and self-interested behavior as any other \\\\npeople. Whether out of a well-meaning but misguided belief or self-\\\\ninterested desires to hide inconvenient or embarrassing narratives, \\\\ngovernment officials can be--and often are--wrong about things.\\\\n    We have vividly seen these processes play out in many facets of \\\\nlife over just the past few years. For example, ideas that were \\\\ninitially suppressed in debates over COVID-19, such as concerns that \\\\nCOVID-19 may have leaked from a lab, have gained traction and greater \\\\nacceptance.\\\\\\\\7\\\\\\\\ Similarly, the Hunter Biden laptop was initially \\\\ndismissed as ``disinformation&#x27;&#x27; before being generally accepted as \\\\nauthentic.\\\\\\\\8\\\\\\\\ Likewise, in 2021, there was a lot of public controversy \\\\naround accusations that U.S. Border Patrol agents whipped migrants at \\\\nthe Mexican border with the reins of their horses. Even the President \\\\nof the United States weighed in, claiming ``people [were] being \\\\nstrapped&#x27;&#x27; and stating ``[i]t&#x27;s outrageous. I promise you those people \\\\nwill pay.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\\\\\9\\\\\\\\ But it turned out not to be true. As Customs and Border \\\\nProtection found following an intensive investigation, ``[t]he \\\\ninvestigation found no evidence that agents struck any person with \\\\nhorse reins.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\\\\\10\\\\\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\7\\\\\\\\ See generally Christiano Lima, Facebook no longer treating \\\\n`man-made&#x27; Covid as a crackpot idea, Politico (May 26, 2021), https://\\\\nwww.politico.com/news/2021/05/26/facebook-ban-covid-man-made-491053.\\\\n    Michael R.

The three most important words in \\\\nthe U.S. Constitution are the first three: ``We the people.&#x27;&#x27; With this \\\\nsimple introduction, the framers of our constitution set out a radical \\\\napproach to government, one where the American people ultimately set \\\\nthe agenda for the Government and government is supposed to be \\\\nresponsive to the American people. Involving the Federal Government in \\\\nregulating ``mis-,&#x27;&#x27; ``dis-,&#x27;&#x27; and ``malinformation&#x27;&#x27; undermines this \\\\nrelationship. It allows the Government to effectively set its own \\\\nagenda, independent of the will of the American people. This is not and \\\\ncannot be correct.\\\\n           iv. government efforts to regulate disinformation\\\\n    Unfortunately, we have seen a creeping erosion of time-honored \\\\nlines protecting free expression from Government intrusion, \\\\nparticularly on social media.\\\\n    The internet is a tool and, like any tool, there is the potential \\\\nfor it to be misused for illegal purposes. The Supreme Court has \\\\nrecognized a ``few&#x27;&#x27; categories of speech ``long familiar to the bar&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nwhere the Government can impose content-based restrictions, such as \\\\nincitement to imminent lawless action, speech integral to criminal \\\\nconduct, or child pornography.\\\\\\\\11\\\\\\\\ The Government can and does have a \\\\nrole in protecting the American people from actual criminal conduct, \\\\neven when it occurs on-line. But this can be fulfilled clearly and \\\\ntransparently through traditional law enforcement channels.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\11\\\\\\\\ United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709, 717 (2012).\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    That is not analogous to what has occurred over the past few years. \\\\nWhat we have seen is a subtle but distinct shift from targeting \\\\nnefarious actions to targeting disfavored ideas. The shift from concern \\\\nabout direct foreign attacks on election infrastructure, such as voting \\\\nmachines and voter rolls, to concerns about ill-advised memes \\\\nillustrates this slippery slope.\\\\n    In early 2017, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson designated \\\\nelection infrastructure as a ``critical infrastructure subsector,&#x27;&#x27; \\\\ngiving the Department of Homeland Security the duty to protect it. \\\\nSecretary Johnson clearly defined election infrastructure as physical \\\\nfacilities and systems used for elections: ``By `election \\\\ninfrastructure,&#x27; we mean storage facilities, polling places, and \\\\ncentralized vote tabulation locations used to support the election \\\\nprocess, and information and communications technology to include voter \\\\nregistration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage \\\\nthe election process and report and display results on behalf of State \\\\nand local governments.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\\\\\12\\\\\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\12\\\\\\\\ Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of \\\\nElection Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector, \\\\nDepartment of Homeland Security (Jan. 6, 2017), https://www.dhs.gov/\\\\nnews/2017/01/06/statement-secretary-johnson-designation-election-\\\\ninfrastructure-\\\\neleccritical#:?:text=statement%20by%20Secretary%20Jeh%20Johnson,as%20a%2\\\\n0Critical- \\\\n%20Infrastructure%20Subsector&amp;text=I%20have%20determined%20that%20electi\\\\non,Govern- ment%20Facilities%20critical%20infrastructure%20&#x27;sector.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    However, by 2019, a subtle shift occurred.

These ideas are listed and expanded upon further in \\\\nour report, Restoring Online Free Speech and Shutting Down the \\\\nCensorship Industrial Complex, which is attached to this testimony:*\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    * The document is retained in committee files and can be found at \\\\nhttps://modernizegovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/\\\\nCensorship.pdf.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    First, we recommend returning to first principles. The Federal \\\\nGovernment--particularly the Executive branch, acting on its own \\\\naccord, should not be the arbiter of truth. Where there is ``bad&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nspeech, the Government should respond by presenting its own views and \\\\nevidence--not seeking to suppress disfavored ideas.\\\\n    Second, there should be bright lines preventing the Federal \\\\nGovernment from interfering with Constitutionally-protected speech. In \\\\nthe limited circumstances where there is a legitimate legal basis to \\\\nsuppress on-line speech--such as preventing the dissemination of child \\\\npornography--the involvement of Federal officials in identifying, \\\\nflagging, or otherwise contributing to the removal should be clear, \\\\nshould be performed only by law enforcement, and should be open to both \\\\npublic and judicial scrutiny.\\\\n    Third, domestic-facing agencies, such as the Department of Homeland \\\\nSecurity and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, should be prohibited \\\\nfrom engaging in activities to restrict ``mis-,&#x27;&#x27; ``dis-,&#x27;&#x27; and \\\\n``malinformation.&#x27;&#x27; This is not to absolve other ostensibly foreign-\\\\nfacing agencies from scrutiny. Rather, it is a recognition that reform \\\\nneeds to start somewhere, and domestic-facing entities are clearly \\\\ninappropriate vehicles for activities with significant implications for \\\\ndomestic free expression, particularly when the raison d&#x27;etre is to \\\\ncounter foreign disinformation.\\\\n    Fourth, the slippery slope in definitional changes that has allowed \\\\naccepted missions, such as protecting ``critical infrastructure,&#x27;&#x27; to \\\\nbe stretched beyond any common understanding must be reined in. \\\\nSignificant changes to organizational missions must be presented to the \\\\npublic and properly debated before being implemented.\\\\n    Fifth, the Federal Government should cut Federal funding for anti-\\\\ndisinformation programs that seek to flag and/or censor First \\\\nAmendment-protected speech. The field of mis- and disinformation does \\\\nnot merely seek to correct inaccurate information through counter \\\\nspeech. It seeks to suppress what it views as untrue information. \\\\nAccordingly, it functions as a high-tech inquisition that is \\\\nirreconcilable with basic principles of free expression. The least that \\\\ncan be done is to close the spigot of taxpayer dollars being used to \\\\ncensor the American people.\\\\n    Sixth, there must be avenues for personal accountability for \\\\nFederal officials who misuse their positions to censor American speech. \\\\nThe right to free speech is central to the proper functioning of a \\\\ndemocratic society. Systematic violations of this right by Government \\\\nofficials wielding the power to regulate or shut down private actors \\\\npresents tremendous danger to the future of political discourse. \\\\nWhether it is conservative speech today or progressive speech tomorrow, \\\\nit is wholly inappropriate for Federal officials to abuse their \\\\nauthority toward this end. However, as is clear in other areas, without \\\\nthe opportunity for personal accountability, the likelihood of \\\\npreventing future abuse is low. Accordingly, there must be both \\\\nemployment consequences and potential liability for the most egregious \\\\ncases, for repeated or blatant First Amendment violations.\\\\n    None of these proposals leaves the Federal Government helpless in \\\\nthe face of actual foreign disinformation campaigns. The solution to \\\\n``bad&#x27;&#x27; speech today is the same as it has always been: more ``good&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nspeech. The Government can still engage in the marketplace of ideas as \\\\na participant--not a moderator--and seek to convince the American \\\\npeople that it is correct based on the persuasive force of its evidence \\\\nand arguments.\\\\n                             vi. conclusion\\\\n    President Reagan warned ``Freedom is a fragile thing and it&#x27;s never \\\\nmore than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by way of \\\\ninheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each \\\\ngeneration, for it comes only once to a people. And those in world \\\\nhistory who have known freedom and then lost it have never known it \\\\nagain.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\\\\\22\\\\\\\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\22\\\\\\\\ Ronald Reagan, Inaugural Address, Ronald Reagan Presidential \\\\nLibrary and Museum (Jan. 5, 1967), https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/\\\\narchives/speech/january-5-1967-inaugural-address-public-ceremony.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    We are, unfortunately, at an inflection point. Our core commitment \\\\nto free expression is being challenged and assailed from many \\\\ndirections in new and unique ways. We must not be the generation that \\\\nallows free expression, unmoderated by Government, to pass away \\\\nquietly. We have the opportunity to preserve the free expression that \\\\nhas served our Nation well for the past 247 years. We must take it and \\\\nresolve to approach questions of truth with proper humility, \\\\nrecognizing that the settled narrative today may be proven wrong \\\\ntomorrow.\\\\n    Thank you very much for the opportunity to discuss these issues. I \\\\ngreatly appreciate your time and consideration.\\\\n                          additional resources\\\\nCurtis Schube &amp; Gary Lawkowski, Restoring Online Free Speech and \\\\nShutting Down the Censorship Industrial Complex, The Council to \\\\nModernize Governance (Dec. 2023).\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Lawkowski.\\\\n    Members will be recognized by order of seniority for 5 \\\\nminutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may \\\\nbe called after all Members have been recognized.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning.\\\\n    I want to begin. I wonder if, Mr. Ivey, if you would pull \\\\nback up--your staff might pull back up the enlargement you had, \\\\nthe first one, the statement by a DHS official from November \\\\n2023.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Mr. Novak.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. I think that is right. If you have the \\\\nenlargement.\\\\n    Let me say as I am beginning, or asking that to come up--\\\\nthank you. I will use in just a second if you hold it for me. \\\\nFirst of all, it is interesting how little separates the views \\\\nexpressed on the panel and I think between me and the Ranking \\\\nMember of the subcommittee. I think therein lies something that \\\\nneeds to be focused on. There are some red herrings or straw \\\\nmen here that can be knocked down pretty quickly.\\\\n    I agree. This is not about partisanship, by the way. I \\\\nmean, I think there is some evidence that the conservatives \\\\nwere more frequently censored, but that is not at all the \\\\npoint. The problem is that it can affect and will affect both \\\\nsides at the same time.\\\\n    Here is what troubles me, though. OK. This is a November \\\\n2023 statement by Brandon Wales. He says CISA does not and has \\\\nnever censored speech or facilitated censorship. Any such \\\\nclaims are patently false. So it would be one thing if this \\\\nturned out to be an excess or a misjudgment or something that \\\\ngrew up naturally out of the COVID pandemic or the election \\\\nconcern that people say, look, we went too far, we have \\\\ncurtailed that, we no longer do that. But that is not what is \\\\nbeing said here. It is a categorical declaration that there has \\\\nbeen no censorship. I have got to tell you, that deepens the \\\\nconcern, because if the situation were, OK, the Disinformation \\\\nGovernance Board has been abandoned because there was a huge \\\\npublic outcry, we would realize at CISA or DHS, that was a \\\\nmistake. That is one thing. But for them to abandon it and for \\\\nthe effort to go subterranean, underground, and be popping up, \\\\nbut continue to be pursued, that is a very significant thing. \\\\nIt certainly justifies the continued examination into this \\\\ntopic.\\\\n    I would say with my friend from Maryland, the Ranking \\\\nMember, this contention that the social media platforms were \\\\nnever compelled, that is the thing that continues to be said, \\\\nand the Ranking Member has read the case, and so have I, from \\\\nthe Fifth Circuit that make clear the tests that are applied is \\\\nnot that you are lined up against the wall with a gun at your \\\\nhead to say you must take this information down off your social \\\\nmedia platform, the question is the degree to which Government \\\\nmay be perceived to have been intensively involved, and thereby \\\\nthe censorship by the so-called private entity becomes \\\\nGovernment action. It is a little bit like the notion, the old \\\\nsaying, you remember, nice little business you got there, it \\\\nwould be a shame if something were to happen to it. That is a \\\\nthreat, even though it isn&#x27;t stated in threatening language.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger, how about that? We have got CISA taking \\\\ndown the video that had the fictional character Sharon urged to \\\\nreport as misinformation what her uncle was stating on-line. \\\\nThey have taken that down. They have done a number of things \\\\nlike that to telegraph that this isn&#x27;t something we are going \\\\nto do anymore. I took that to be the thrust of Jen Easterly&#x27;s \\\\ntestimony in the Appropriations Committee. Yet this is a \\\\ndeclaration we have never done it. There is not even an issue \\\\nabout whether we have done it or something that needs to get \\\\nironed out. What about that? Shouldn&#x27;t we be concerned about \\\\nthat phenomenon?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Yes, I mean definitely. I mean if it \\\\nwere up to me, I think if there&#x27;s important cybersecurity \\\\nactivities happening in CISA, that should continue, I think \\\\nthey need to be under a different agency because this agency \\\\nactively not just participated, but led this creation of a \\\\ncensorship apparatus. Now that&#x27;s them saying, oh, we were just \\\\ndoing research. It was a mass flagging and censorship operation \\\\nthat was coordinated with a broader effort to pressure the \\\\nplatforms to do more censorship. That was going on since 2016.\\\\n    So, yes, I think it&#x27;s disingenuous to suggest that they \\\\nwere just doing research.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Mr. Chenoweth, as the litigation like \\\\nMissouri v. Biden, you mentioned the Murthy case--I guess it is \\\\nMurthy in the Supreme Court, I guess, is the name of it there. \\\\nCourts have differed sometimes with themselves on what level of \\\\ngovernment actions constitute interference with freedom of \\\\nspeech. Why is that a challenge, and how should courts resolve \\\\nit?\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. I think there&#x27;s a concern that there may be \\\\na category mistake here, Mr. Chairman, because a lot of the \\\\nprecedents--because the Government hasn&#x27;t done this kind of \\\\ncensorship, by and large, going back 10, 20, 40, 50 years. So \\\\nthe precedents that exist at the Supreme Court are largely \\\\nprecedents where there have been private entities that have \\\\nbeen doing censorship and have been sued. Bantam Books is an \\\\nexample of this. Then the question is, well, was that private \\\\nconduct turned into State action? So if you&#x27;re suing a private \\\\nentity and you&#x27;re trying to--because if it is a private entity, \\\\nit&#x27;s truly private action, then the First Amendment doesn&#x27;t \\\\napply. So if you&#x27;re suing a private entity and saying that they \\\\nengaged in state action, then there&#x27;s precedents that suggest, \\\\nhow do you know that there&#x27;s state action there? The tests have \\\\nbeen things like coercion and so forth, also entanglement. \\\\nAlso, the way that you described it, Mr. Chairman, is just how \\\\ninvolved are we here? But the reason for that is because we \\\\nwant to be very careful about saying that a private entity has \\\\nbecome a public entity. We need to be very careful about that. \\\\nWe need to draw that line carefully, because if that private \\\\nentity is treated as a public entity, then its liberties have \\\\nreally been constricted, particularly by the First Amendment \\\\nthen applying to it.\\\\n    But that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about here. In Murthy v. \\\\nMissouri, we didn&#x27;t sue any private entities. We&#x27;re suing the \\\\nGovernment. The question is, what&#x27;s the standard that affects \\\\nthe Government when the Government is engaged in Government-led \\\\ncensorship? The standard there shouldn&#x27;t be coercion, it \\\\nshouldn&#x27;t be the standard that applies when you&#x27;re suing a \\\\nprivate entity. It needs to be the First Amendment standard. \\\\nThe text of the First Amendment says abridge, and that means \\\\ndiminish. You&#x27;re telling me that nothing that CISA did \\\\ndiminished free speech, that it didn&#x27;t diminish speech? Of \\\\ncourse it did. The whole point of it was to diminish speech.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Undoubtedly it did.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chenoweth.\\\\n    My time is long since expired. I thank you for that.\\\\n    But I now recognize Ranking Member Ivey for 5 minutes for \\\\nany questions he may have.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Yes, I think we have some different views on this. I will \\\\njust tell you what my thinking is on some of this.\\\\n    I guess we draw the line in different places as to what \\\\nrole governments should play with respect to public speech or \\\\ncomments. For example, we have talked about this in previous \\\\nhearings. I mean, tobacco, for example. When I was a young kid, \\\\nthere was an argument back and forth about whether it caused \\\\ncancer or not, whether it was detrimental to health. I think we \\\\ncertainly hit the point, the 1980&#x27;s or 1990&#x27;s or so, where it \\\\nbecame clear, I think scientifically, that it was causing a \\\\nproblem. The Government decided, in addition to private support \\\\nfrom the medical community, that public service announcement \\\\ncampaigns across the country to try and reduce the level of \\\\nsmoking was in order. In fact, that was part of the settlement \\\\nwith the tobacco companies. So those ads started running. I \\\\nthink even you can find now people who dispute whether tobacco \\\\ncauses cancer or not. But I think it is pretty clear that that \\\\nwas the Government effort with respect to speech that took a \\\\nstand that was in favor of public safety. Seatbelts is another \\\\none. We have got a number of these we could go through.\\\\n    COVID, I know, is controversial, so I hate to walk into the \\\\nhornets nest, but some of those points, I appreciate the points \\\\nyou made, Mr. Chenoweth. Some of them I kind-of was definitely \\\\non the side of we need to do something like that, where like \\\\ninjecting bleach will cure you of COVID was one of those. So I \\\\ntake the point that, I guess that was Mr. Lawkowski on the trip \\\\nfrom Virginia to Baltimore, was talking about how sometimes the \\\\nGovernment is not right, sometimes it is. That is a fair point. \\\\nBut I think what I am hearing from the table, at least for Mr. \\\\nChenoweth and with Mr. Shellenberger, is Government should \\\\nnever be taking positions on what is accurate or true or \\\\ncorrect, and that is not really my view.\\\\n    But, Mr. Chenoweth, I wanted to give you a chance to--if \\\\nyou give me a brief response, is there a line that you would \\\\ndraw where you think it is OK for the Government to take public \\\\nstatements, disagree with information that is out there? Then \\\\nhere is the line, I think, for the censorship piece, reach out \\\\nto platforms and say, add content or flag it or whatever?\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the Government \\\\ntaking a position on anything. I think that that&#x27;s Government \\\\nspeech and that&#x27;s fine. I think the problem is when you have \\\\nthe Government reaching out to platforms to shut down other \\\\nspeech, that becomes censorship. In terms of when they can and \\\\ncan&#x27;t do that, if they&#x27;re reaching out to a platform to shut \\\\ndown unlawful speech, which I would suggest----\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Sure, that is fine.\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth [continuing]. The child----\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Yes, child porn. Sure. Terrorism.\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth [continuing]. Pornography example. No problem \\\\nwith that at all.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. But if you&#x27;re reaching out to a platform to \\\\nshut down lawful speech, such as Dr. Kulldorff&#x27;s tweet about \\\\nwho should and shouldn&#x27;t get vaccinated, that was lawful \\\\nspeech.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Well, let me ask you to draw the line on that, \\\\nwhen you say shut down. Remove would be I guess what you mean \\\\nby shut down. Is flagging it or adding comments to it, are you \\\\nOK with that?\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. Well, I&#x27;m certainly not OK with the \\\\nGovernment flagging it or the Government adding comments.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Well, Government asking the social--because \\\\nGovernment is not controlling the social media platforms, but \\\\nasking the social media, hey, can you flag? My view, too, is \\\\nthat that is the decision that is made by the social media \\\\nplatforms. I don&#x27;t think it is the Sopranos coming to get them \\\\notherwise, but go ahead.\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. I think that&#x27;s diminishing and therefore \\\\nabridging speech and therefore a direct violation of the First \\\\nAmendment.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. So the Government asking, I don&#x27;t know, Twitter \\\\nor X, whatever they call it now, to flag statement X is an \\\\nabridgement and a First Amendment violation?\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. Absolutely if that----\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Automatically?\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth [continuing]. Speech is lawful speech.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. OK.\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. I think that&#x27;s a very clear and easy line to \\\\ndraw.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. OK. I define abridged a little differently than \\\\nyou do, I think, in the first Amendment context, but that is \\\\nOK.\\\\n    I did want to read this piece here, too, though. This is \\\\nfrom Yoel Roth. I think this is kind-of a fact issue. He is \\\\nformerly at Twitter and testified here from the Oversight \\\\nCommittee on February 8. He is talking about threats that were \\\\ncoming over the internet. In an effort to get ahead of these \\\\nkinds of threats, Twitter and other tech companies worked to \\\\nbuild closer information-sharing relationships with law \\\\nenforcement, such as the FBI. In the recent reporting known as \\\\nthe Twitter files, there was an attempt to portray interactions \\\\nbetween Twitter and other social media platforms and the FBI&#x27;s \\\\npolitically-driven interference. My experience of these \\\\ninteractions was different. Across the FBI, DHS, and other \\\\nagencies, the professionals responsible for combating malign \\\\nforeign interference in elections did so with integrity and the \\\\nutmost care and respect for the laws of this country, including \\\\nthe First Amendment.\\\\n    I would ask that we make this part of the record.\\\\n    I see I am over my time.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Without objection, so ordered.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n Statement of Yoel Roth, PhD, Former Head of Trust &amp; Safety, Twitter, \\\\n                                  Inc.\\\\n                            February 8, 2023\\\\nHearing on ``Protecting Speech from Government Interference and Social \\\\n        Media Bias, Part 1: Twitter&#x27;s Role in Suppressing the Biden \\\\n        Laptop Story&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n            Before the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight \\\\n                    and Accountability\\\\n    Thank you, Chairman Comer, Ranking Member Raskin, and Members of \\\\nthe Committee, for the opportunity to speak with you here today.\\\\n    In nearly 8 years at Twitter, I worked in and led a division called \\\\nTrust &amp; Safety. Trust &amp; Safety&#x27;s core duty is content moderation: \\\\nLabeling or removing Tweets that violate Twitter&#x27;s terms of service, \\\\nand suspending or banning users who repeatedly break the rules. This \\\\nwork is sometimes dismissed merely as censorship--but it represents a \\\\nkey way that Twitter and other companies live up to their \\\\nresponsibility to keep the users of their products safe.\\\\n    Much of this work is uncontroversial and obviously good: For \\\\nexample, taking down accounts that engage in child sexual exploitation \\\\nor promote terrorism. Although this content represents a tiny fraction \\\\nof the overall volume of conversation on social media, the dangers it \\\\nposes means platforms like Twitter have a responsibility to find it and \\\\nremove it promptly.

Since 2020, numerous \\\\n        election officials have resigned from their positions, many \\\\n        citing threats related to misinformation about their work.\\\\\\\\8\\\\\\\\ \\\\n        This dynamic threatens the very foundations of our elections, \\\\n        and our democracy.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\7\\\\\\\\ For example, recently election officials in several States \\\\nreceived envelopes with suspicious letters and white substances, \\\\nincluding fentanyl: https://www.npr.org/2023/11/09/1212045794/\\\\nenvelopes-with-fentanyl-or-other-substances-were-sent-to-several-\\\\nelections-offic.\\\\n    \\\\\\\\8\\\\\\\\ https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-false-accusations-election-fraud-\\\\nprompt-election-workers/story?id=88739763.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    (6) Pervasive mis- and disinformation about election integrity can \\\\n        lead to maladaptive changes to election procedures that make \\\\n        election outcomes more uncertain. Scholars have long explained \\\\n        that uncertainty powers the rumor mill, creating conditions \\\\n        where people are more vulnerable to rumoring and manipulation. \\\\n        In response to false claims about election procedures, we have \\\\n        seen election processes changed in ways that add uncertainty to \\\\n        the process, for example by delaying the processing or counting \\\\n        of ballots or removing systems that check for people who are \\\\n        registered to vote in multiple states.\\\\\\\\9\\\\\\\\ These changes can \\\\n        lead to more misinformation, feeding a kind of ``unvirtuous \\\\n        cycle&#x27;&#x27; where misinformation reduces election integrity.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    \\\\\\\\9\\\\\\\\ For example, after conspiracy theories targeted the ERIC system \\\\nwhich helps to maintain voter rolls and check for duplicates across \\\\nStates, multiple States have exited the program. https://\\\\nwww.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/06/election-deniers-voter-\\\\nrolls.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    (7) Additionally, pervasive mis- and disinformation about voting \\\\n        processes and election results creates a ``boy who cried wolf&#x27;&#x27; \\\\n        situation where real threats to election integrity could be \\\\n        overlooked, lost within the noise of false claims. Bad actors, \\\\n        including foreign adversaries, may seek to exploit these \\\\n        conditions to advance their aims through actual attacks on \\\\n        election integrity.\\\\n    (8) Foreign adversaries are known to use active measures and \\\\n        disinformation to undermine trust in democratic processes and \\\\n        results. The pervasive spread of falsehoods about U.S. \\\\n        elections creates informational conditions that render us \\\\n        increasingly vulnerable to outside manipulation, and foreign \\\\n        actors may attempt to exploit these conditions--both by \\\\n        amplifying domestically-created rumors and by seeding new \\\\n        falsehoods--to advance their aims.\\\\n           the chilling effect on disinformation researchers\\\\n    Alongside the rise of mis- and disinformation which rattles \\\\nconfidence in our elections and electoral processes, we have also \\\\nwitnessed a multi-dimensional attack on the researchers and academics \\\\nwho seek to understand misinformation and its impacts. Quite \\\\npersonally, over the past year my team and I have been subjected to \\\\npersistent negative reporting in partisan media, on-line harassment, \\\\nthreats, lawsuits, subpoenas, Congressional probes, and dozens of \\\\npublic records requests. These have become a significant tax on our \\\\ntime, financial resources, and well-being. Many other researchers are \\\\nexperiencing the same.\\\\n    This attack on our field is having a marked chilling effect on the \\\\nspeech of misinformation researchers. Prominent voices in public debate \\\\nhave gone silent, encumbered by legal stress and institutional \\\\npressure. Some institutions, fearful of the political blowback, are \\\\nstepping back from publicly supporting their researchers and in some \\\\ncases are pressuring their researchers to refrain from public comment, \\\\neven to refrain from defending themselves against false allegations. \\\\nAdditionally, some junior scholars are expressing fears about working \\\\nwithin a field where future institutions may be reluctant to take on \\\\nthe risk of hiring them.\\\\n    At a time when pervasive disinformation has become a critical \\\\nchallenge for democratic societies, the very people who study and \\\\nprovide insights into addressing that challenge are being silenced by \\\\nthose who purport to stand for ``free speech&#x27;&#x27; and falsely frame our \\\\nwork as ``censorship&#x27;&#x27;. But, just as the First Amendment protects the \\\\nrights of U.S. citizens to openly express their opinions about our \\\\nelections, even if some turn out to be false, it also certainly \\\\nprotects the rights of researchers to call out powerful people and \\\\nplatforms for spreading misinformation and disinformation.\\\\n                                 ______\\\\n                                 \\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n                                 \\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. Mr. Chairman, could I respond to the Yoel \\\\nRoth point? Is that possible?\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Well, let me see, Mr. Chenoweth. I think \\\\nthere is a reasonably good likelihood we will enter a second \\\\nround. We want to stick to the time so no Members are \\\\ndisadvantaged.\\\\n    That is true. I will tell you, let me see, we will see \\\\nwhether we get through the other witnesses. We will try to \\\\nremember to come back to the point at some point in time, if we \\\\ncan, if a Member&#x27;s time permits. Sorry about that, Mr. \\\\nChenoweth.\\\\n    With that, I recognize Ms. Greene for 5, is that right, Ms. \\\\nGreene? Ms. Greene for 5 minutes of questioning.\\\\n    Ms. Greene. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for \\\\ndoing this hearing.\\\\n    CISA claims that it has not engaged in censorship, and that \\\\nis a complete and total lie. Mr. Shellenberger, I read an \\\\narticle recently that you had written and it was about me and \\\\nthe fact that I had been censored. It was through CISA engaging \\\\nwith the DNC, the NAACP, homeland security, flagging my tweets, \\\\nwriting tickets on them. Also, amazingly, which to my shock, I \\\\nread details of these tickets, making up complete falsehoods \\\\nabout me. Talk about misinformation. This is taxpayer-funded \\\\nGovernment agencies lying about a Member of Congress, about \\\\nwhat I said, taking other people&#x27;s statements and writing it in \\\\ncontext of what I said on my own social media, then taking down \\\\nmy actual social media post, which is shocking, absolutely \\\\nshocking.\\\\n    So, Mr. Shellenberger, I would like to ask you a little bit \\\\nmore. You worked on the Twitter files, and I want to thank you \\\\nfor that work and thank you for writing this article, calling \\\\nattention to the fact that me, as a Member of Congress, had my \\\\nown First Amendment violated. That is also a First Amendment \\\\nviolation on behalf of my entire district because they elected \\\\nme and sent me here to represent them. So thank you. Thank you \\\\nvery much for that. What most surprised you or further alarmed \\\\nyou when you learned everything you did through Twitter Files?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Thank you for the question, \\\\nCongresswoman.\\\\n    I mean I think I was shocked to see Members of Congress \\\\nbeing censored. That was shocking to me. We were shocked to see \\\\nhow many Government employees were constantly emailing Twitter. \\\\nCarlos Monje, an executive I cited in my Twitter Files on the \\\\nHunter Biden laptop, complained about all the pressure that \\\\nthey were getting from the Federal Government. I think the most \\\\nshocking thing, though, was it was sort-of like what you&#x27;re \\\\nsaying is that the censorship was actually in service of \\\\ndisinformation efforts, and that what you&#x27;re really looking at \\\\nwhen you&#x27;re looking at the Cyber Threat Intelligence League is \\\\nan operation. It looks like a military intelligence operation \\\\nthat clearly they drew right from fighting terrorists abroad \\\\nand they turned those tools against the American people. So \\\\ncensorship was just one of the countermeasures that they had \\\\nset up.\\\\n    But with the Hunter Biden laptop, it was a disinformation \\\\ncampaign aimed at tying the laptop to the Russians, even though \\\\nthere was no evidence for it. So you might have a situation \\\\nwhere Yoel Roth is like, oh, I&#x27;ve got a good relationship with \\\\nthe FBI, but he&#x27;s the target of an operation that was aimed at \\\\nconvincing him that there was something suspicious about the \\\\nHunter Biden laptop, even though they had the receipt from \\\\nHunter Biden and they had the FBI subpoena taking the laptop in \\\\nDecember 2019. So, in fact, their own review of the laptop, \\\\nthey came back that it was not the result of a hack. So what \\\\nyou see is that, I think, to what Mr. Chenoweth was describing, \\\\nis it&#x27;s not just coercion. They&#x27;re actually sort-of--I don&#x27;t \\\\nknow, how do you describe it--they&#x27;re kind-of working, these \\\\nguys. They&#x27;re using a lot of--they&#x27;re being very sweet often. \\\\nIt&#x27;s often very kind and friendly, a lot of trying to be like, \\\\nwe&#x27;re all on the same team here. You have to remember, I think \\\\nit was like, over 96 percent of all Twitter executive donations \\\\nwent to Democrats. So it&#x27;s a very partisan institution to begin \\\\nwith. So they&#x27;re already primed to believe that there may be \\\\nsomething wrong with that Hunter Biden laptop.\\\\n    So what was important is not just that it was censored, but \\\\nreally that Twitter participated in the disinformation effort \\\\nto create the perception that there was something illegitimate \\\\nabout it and that it was a result of a hacking leak.\\\\n    Ms. Greene. Right. So did Facebook.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Greene. So did Google.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. That&#x27;s right.\\\\n    Ms. Greene. Largely the internet.\\\\n    Speaking of the partisan difference there, we have who was \\\\nbeing censored? President Donald J. Trump, Senator Thom Tillis, \\\\nSpeaker Newt Gingrich, Governor Mike Huckabee, Congressman \\\\nThomas Massey, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Newsmax, \\\\nthe Babylon Bee, Sean Hannity, Mollie Hemingway, Harmeet \\\\nDhillon, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens, Jack Posobeic, Tom \\\\nFitton, James O&#x27;Keefe, Benny Johnson, Michelle Malkin, Sean \\\\nDavis, Dave Rubin, Paul Sperry, Tracy Beanz, Chanel Rion. Then \\\\nadd in the most offensive--what I consider to be the most \\\\noffensive, an untold number of everyday Americans of all \\\\npolitical affiliations. These are people that don&#x27;t have \\\\npowerful platforms like me as a Member of Congress, these are \\\\naverage American citizens that rely on the Government to \\\\nprotect their rights, their freedom of speech. It is \\\\noutrageous.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I certainly would like to completely defund \\\\nCISA. It is an agency that should not exist. It has violated \\\\nthe American people&#x27;s rights. We should completely get rid of \\\\nit, and it shouldn&#x27;t be entitled to do this anymore.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The gentlewoman yields back.\\\\n    I recognize Ms. Clarke for 5 minutes of question.\\\\n    Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Ranking \\\\nMember Ivey, and good afternoon.\\\\n    Before I begin, I want to correct some statements made by \\\\nthe Chairman about Jen Easterly and CISA. First, Jen Easterly \\\\nnever recommended regulating cognitive infrastructure. I ask \\\\nunanimous consent to submit into the record an article from The \\\\nHill containing her full quote.\\\\n    [The information follows:]\\\\n      Cyber Agency Beefing Up Disinformation, Misinformation Team\\\\nBy Maggie Miller--11/10/21 2:52 PM ET, The Hill\\\\n    The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is \\\\nbeefing up its disinformation and misinformation team in the wake of a \\\\ndivisive Presidential election that saw a proliferation of misleading \\\\ninformation online.\\\\n    ``I am actually going to grow and strengthen my misinformation and \\\\ndisinformation team,&#x27;&#x27; CISA Director Jen Easterly said during virtual \\\\nremarks at the RE:WIRED conference on Wednesday.\\\\n    Easterly noted that earlier this week she had a meeting with ``six \\\\nof the nation&#x27;s experts&#x27;&#x27; in the disinformation and misinformation \\\\nspace. She stressed her concerns around this being a top threat for \\\\nCISA, which is charged with securing critical infrastructure, to \\\\nconfront.\\\\n    ``One could argue we&#x27;re in the business of critical infrastructure, \\\\nand the most critical infrastructure is our cognitive infrastructure, \\\\nso building that resilience to misinformation and disinformation, I \\\\nthink, is incredibly important,&#x27;&#x27; Easterly said.\\\\n    ``We are going to work with our partners in the private sector and \\\\nthroughout the rest of the government and at the department to continue \\\\nto ensure that the American people have the facts that they need to \\\\nhelp protect our critical infrastructure,&#x27;&#x27; she added.\\\\n    Despite the political pressure, the rumor control site remains up. \\\\nEasterly pledged in September to continue using the page, and CISA did \\\\nindeed use the rumor control site to counter election disinformation \\\\nand misinformation during the recent 2021 elections in 30 States, \\\\nincluding the closely watched Virginia Governor&#x27;s race.\\\\n    ``We now live in a world where people talk about alternative facts, \\\\npost-truth, which I think is really, really dangerous if you get to \\\\npick your own facts, and it&#x27;s particularly corrosive when you talk \\\\nabout matters of election security,&#x27;&#x27; Easterly said Wednesday.\\\\n    ``There is a certain percentage of the American people that are not \\\\ngoing to be convinced and are not going to listen to the government, we \\\\nget that, but there is a certain part of the American public that do \\\\nstill trust the government and that do still come to us and that get \\\\nfacts about things that can be difficult to understand,&#x27;&#x27; she said.\\\\n    Microsoft President and Vice Chairman Brad Smith on Wednesday \\\\nseparately sounded the alarm about online disinformation and \\\\nmisinformation impacting issues including elections and COVID-19 \\\\nvaccine rollout.\\\\n    Smith specifically warned about the ability of foreign governments \\\\nto use disinformation to meddle in another country&#x27;s affairs, an issue \\\\nthat became particularly concerning following Russian efforts to spread \\\\ndisinformation to sway the 2016 U.S. Presidential election in favor of \\\\nTrump.\\\\n    ``It has become in some ways almost a tool of choice to disrupt a \\\\ndemocracy, to sow dissent, to cause people to question even fundamental \\\\nfacts like who won the election and is this vaccine safe, or does it \\\\nwork,&#x27;&#x27; Smith said in a speech at the Sciences Po Paris School of \\\\nInternational Affairs. ``In some ways, it may be far more effective, \\\\nit&#x27;s certainly less expensive, to launch a government-sponsored \\\\ndisinformation campaign than it is to build a hypersonic missile, and \\\\nwe have some countries that have the resources easily to do both.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Clarke. On a related manner, aside from cyber incident \\\\nreporting, CISA is not a regulator. It has no authority to \\\\nregulate critical infrastructure outside of cyber incident \\\\nreporting.\\\\n    Second, when asked at an appropriations hearing, Jen \\\\nEasterly responded to questions about switchboarding in the \\\\npresent tense. It is true that CISA no longer engages in \\\\nswitchboarding. Switchboarding occurred during the previous \\\\nadministration.\\\\n    Finally, the CISA advisory committee&#x27;s MDM subcommittee \\\\ndoes not exist any longer and hasn&#x27;t existed for over a year. \\\\nEvery recommendation the subcommittee made while it has existed \\\\nis on the website.\\\\n    So, having said that, there has been a lot of discussion \\\\nand fear-mongering about the work of DHS and CISA in particular \\\\nand I appreciate this opportunity to set the record straight.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger, in your testimony, you advocate for \\\\nabolishing CISA, an agency created by legislation led by former \\\\ncommittee Chairman Mike McCaul, a Republican, and signed into \\\\nlaw by former President Donald Trump. At the time, President \\\\nTrump stated that CISA would, and I quote, ``lead Federal \\\\nGovernment&#x27;s civilian response to cyber threats against our \\\\nNation&#x27;&#x27;. We have had many, many threats. The men and women of \\\\nthe new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will \\\\nbe on the front lines of our cyber defense. They will partner \\\\nwith the private sector and all levels of government to defend \\\\nAmerica&#x27;s power grids, banks, telecommunications, and other \\\\ncritical parts of our economy. As the cyber battleship evolves, \\\\nthis new agency will ensure that we confront the full range of \\\\nthreats from nation-states, cyber criminals, and other \\\\nmalicious actors, of which there are many. This is an enormous \\\\nmission.\\\\n    Over the past 5 years, CISA has rapidly built capacity to \\\\nhelp State and local governments and critical infrastructure \\\\ndefend against and build resilience to a range of cyber \\\\nthreats. CISA spends $45 million of its nearly $3 billion \\\\nbudget on election security.\\\\n    So, Mr. Shellenberger, do you know what percent of CISA&#x27;s \\\\nbudget, overall budget that is? Let me tell you that that is \\\\nabout 1.5 percent of its overall budget--about 1.5 percent. Of \\\\nthe $45 million CISA spends on election security, about $2 \\\\nmillion of those funds are used to support efforts to counter \\\\ninfluence operations.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger, do you know what percentage of CISA&#x27;s \\\\nbudget that is?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Too much.\\\\n    Ms. Clarke. It is not even one-tenth of a percent of CISA&#x27;s \\\\noverall budget.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Yet, here we are debating it.\\\\n    Ms. Clarke. Excuse me. I am reclaiming my time.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, at the outset, it is clear that CISA has not \\\\nengaged in any nefarious or unconstitutional activity. There is \\\\nsimply no evidence of it. But suggesting to abolish an agency \\\\nbecause you disagree with less than 2 percent of what it does \\\\nis just not a serious recommendation.\\\\n    So let me thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the \\\\nbalance of my time.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The gentlewoman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Mr. Crane for 5 minutes of questioning.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this \\\\nhearing today. I want to say thank you to those of you on the \\\\npanel for showing up.\\\\n    I want to start with just asking the panel, generally, do \\\\nyou trust the Federal Government to censor speech? I will start \\\\nwith you, Mr. Shellenberger.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. No.\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. I do not.\\\\n    Mr. Abdo. The government should not be censoring speech.\\\\n    Mr. Lawkowski. Absolutely not.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Would all of you gentlemen say that generally, \\\\nyou are students of history? Generally.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Generally.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. OK. What kind of governments typically are most \\\\nlikely to censor their people?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger, I will start with you.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Authoritarian and totalitarian ones.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Yes. What about you, sir?\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. I agree.\\\\n    Mr. Abdo. I agree.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Mr. Lawkowski.\\\\n    Mr. Lawkowski. I agree. I would add ones that aren&#x27;t \\\\nconfident in their own abilities to govern.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Yes, absolutely. Now, why do you think these \\\\ntypes of governments typically want to control and censor the \\\\nspeech of their own citizens?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Because they are behaving \\\\nundemocratically in a variety of ways, and they don&#x27;t want to \\\\nbe called out for it.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Absolutely.\\\\n    What about you, Mr. Chenoweth.\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. I think there&#x27;s many reasons. I think they \\\\nwant to hold on to power. Anything that&#x27;s happening in their \\\\nsociety that appears to be out of control, that&#x27;s out of their \\\\npower, is something that is a threat to them being dislodged \\\\nfrom power. So they want to control the information atmosphere \\\\nin order to hold on to power.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Mr. Abdo.\\\\n    Mr. Abdo. Generally to silence dissent.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Mr. Lawkowski.\\\\n    Mr. Lawkowski. I would say it&#x27;s out of a sense of \\\\narrogance, the sense that they&#x27;re right and that anyone who \\\\ndisagrees with them is wrong, and that that needs to be \\\\ncorrected through a proper degree of humility.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Mr. Lawkowski, do you see any of those signs \\\\nthat you just pointed out, the arrogance, in this Federal \\\\nGovernment?\\\\n    Mr. Lawkowski. Absolutely. I think it was on vivid display \\\\nduring the COVID response and in a number of other areas.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Mr. Shellenberger, how about you? Do you see any \\\\nof those signs in this current Government?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Yes, many signs.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Do you think it is rational to believe that a \\\\nprivate company, even one as large as Twitter or Facebook, \\\\nmight feel intimidated or coerced if the most powerful \\\\nGovernment in the history of the world contacted them to alert \\\\nthem to a post that they found problematic?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Yes, and we saw that intimidation \\\\nrepeatedly in the Twitter files.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. What about the rest of you guys? You think they \\\\nmight feel coerced or intimidated?\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. Absolutely. We&#x27;ve had four Federal judges \\\\nwho have found that, in fact, that happened.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. In your opinion, do you think the American \\\\npeople have any reason to question the official narratives put \\\\nout by this Government, both this one right now and past \\\\nGovernments?\\\\n    Mr. Abdo. Yes, many reasons.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Mr. Shellenberger, can you go into a short list \\\\nof official positions that they have released on certain things \\\\nthat you found to be problematic and rightly see the American \\\\npeople being rational to question those narratives?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. I would say the Afghanistan pull-out, \\\\nthe Ukraine war, the efficacy of the COVID vaccine, the lack of \\\\ntransparency on COVID origins, the cost of the Inflation \\\\nReduction Act, viability of renewables. Anyway, how long do you \\\\nhave?\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Yes, I had some of those same ones on my list. \\\\nWhat about the Hunter Biden laptop? Would that be on your list, \\\\nsir?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Yes, for sure. I mean, it was clearly a \\\\ndisinformation campaign that involved existing and former \\\\nGovernment officials.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Yes. What do you gentlemen typically think when \\\\nyou see the billboards pulled up with official statements from \\\\nindividuals at CISA? You know, nothing to see here, nothing to \\\\nsee here. What do you guys think about that? Just more of the \\\\nsame CYA, cover your ass, type deals?\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger, I will start with you.\\\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. I&#x27;m mixed between it being sinister and \\\\ncomedic.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Yes. What about you, Mr. Chenoweth?\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. I think that there&#x27;s a misimpression on the \\\\npart of some of these individuals that if they act through \\\\nthird parties that they&#x27;re not violating the First Amendment. \\\\nThey&#x27;re wrong about that, but they&#x27;re not all lawyers, I get \\\\nthat. But they need to understand that they are blatantly \\\\nviolating the First Amendment when they work through third \\\\nparties to achieve censorship.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Mr. Abdo, do you have anything to add to that?\\\\n    Mr. Abdo. Yes, Congressman, I think the question, the \\\\nConstitutional one that the Supreme Court set out in 1963, is \\\\nwhether the Government has coerced the suppression of speech. \\\\nI&#x27;ll give you just a couple of examples where I think it&#x27;s \\\\nactually important for the Government to be able to contribute \\\\nto public discourse and also to contribute to persuading \\\\nprivate actors into making decisions about the speech.\\\\n    In 2004, the New York Times was leaked information about \\\\nthe Bush administration&#x27;s warrantless wiretapping program, and \\\\nmembers of the Bush administration met with the New York Times \\\\nand convinced the New York Times that to disclose that \\\\ninformation in 2004 would result in deaths in the disclosure of \\\\nundercover sources. The New York Times held on to that story \\\\nfor a year. I happen to think the New York Times probably made \\\\nthe wrong decision in being persuaded by the Bush \\\\nadministration to hold on to that story for a year. But I think \\\\nit&#x27;s relevant to the New York Times&#x27; decision making what the \\\\nGovernment thinks about the likelihood that disclosing that \\\\ninformation would cause real harm to the national security \\\\ninterests of the United States, even though the New York Times&#x27; \\\\npublication of that story was unquestionably Constitutionally-\\\\nprotected.\\\\n    So I think there is a role for Government in persuading \\\\nprivate actors to take into account the harms of the \\\\nindependent editorial decisions they make.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr.----\\\\n    Mr. Chenoweth. But that was the New York Times&#x27; own speech \\\\nthat it was holding back on, not a third party&#x27;s speech.\\\\n    Mr. Abdo. I think that the Bantam Books case is the case \\\\nabout third-party speech. It was a lawsuit brought against--I \\\\nthink inconsistently what you said earlier, Mr. Chenoweth--it \\\\nwas a lawsuit brought against the Rhode Island Commission on \\\\nMorality and Youth, arguing that that commission had exceeded \\\\nits authority in attempting to coerce book distributors and \\\\npublishers into taking off their shelves material that the \\\\ncommission had deemed to be obscene or offensive.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Thank you. Thank you.\\\\n    I yield.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Crane.\\\\n    I thank the witnesses. I would actually love to hear from \\\\nall of you more. Our time is unfortunately limited. We have \\\\nanother panel.\\\\n    The Members of the subcommittee may have additional \\\\nquestions for this panel of witnesses. We would ask the \\\\nwitnesses to respond to those in writing. Pursuant to committee \\\\nrule VII(D), the hearing record will remain open for 10 days \\\\nfor that.\\\\n    These witnesses are dismissed and the committee will be in \\\\nrecess for 15 minutes to commence with the second panel.\\\\n    [Recess.]\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The Committee on Homeland Security \\\\nSubcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and accountability \\\\nwill come to order.\\\\n    I am pleased to have as our second panel a panel of \\\\nwitnesses from the Department of Homeland Security before us \\\\ntoday to speak on this very important topic.\\\\n    I ask that our witnesses please rise and raise your right \\\\nhands.\\\\n    [Witnesses sworn.]\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Thank you. You may be seated.\\\\n    Let the record reflect that the witnesses have answered in \\\\nthe affirmative.\\\\n    I would now like to formally introduce our additional \\\\nwitnesses. I hope I am going to get your name right, sir. Mr. \\\\nIranga Kahangama is the assistant secretary for cyber, \\\\ninfrastructure, risk, and resilience at the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security. Ms. Mona Harrington is the assistant \\\\ndirector for the National Risk Management Center at the \\\\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\\\\n    I thank these witnesses for being here today.\\\\n    The Chair will now recognize each witness for oral \\\\nstatements. Each oral statement will be limited to 5 minutes, \\\\nbut submitted written statements by witnesses will appear in \\\\nthe hearing record in their entirety.\\\\n    I now recognize Mr. Kahangama for 5 minutes for his opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF IRANGA KAHANGAMA, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, CYBER, \\\\n   INFRASTRUCTURE, RISK, AND RESILIENCE, OFFICE OF STRATEGY, \\\\n    POLICY, AND PLANS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and distinguished \\\\nMembers of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here \\\\ntoday to discuss the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s efforts \\\\nto counter the impacts of foreign influence operations and \\\\ndisinformation impacting our homeland security.\\\\n    I serve as the Department&#x27;s assistant secretary for cyber, \\\\ninfrastructure, risk, and resilience. In this role, I lead the \\\\nDepartment&#x27;s efforts on cybersecurity and critical \\\\ninfrastructure policy. Nation-state adversaries, such as \\\\nRussia, China, and Iran, are likely to continue to conduct \\\\novert and covert influence operations to shape U.S. policy and \\\\nundermine trust in U.S. Government institutions, social \\\\ncohesion, and democratic processes. With the upcoming election \\\\ncycle of 2024, our adversaries are likely seeking more \\\\nopportunity than ever before.\\\\n    The U.S. intelligence community&#x27;s Annual Threat Assessment \\\\nfor 2023 notes that the People&#x27;s Republic of China seeks to \\\\nexpand its malign influence campaigns to better support its \\\\npolitical, economic, and security goals. Beijing utilizes a \\\\nbroad array of highly sophisticated covert, overt, licit, and \\\\nillicit means to conduct these operations. Their U.S.-based \\\\ninfluence operations are focused on shaping U.S. policy and the \\\\nAmerican public&#x27;s perception of the DRC. Russia presents one of \\\\nthe most serious foreign influence threats to the United States \\\\nbecause it utilizes its intelligence services, proxies, and \\\\nwide-ranging influence tools to try to sow discord inside the \\\\nUnited States and divide Western allies. Moscow views U.S. \\\\nelections as opportunities for malign influence as part of its \\\\nbroader foreign policy strategy.\\\\n    While these risks are not new, our interconnected world, \\\\nthe anonymous nature of the internet, and emerging technologies \\\\nchange the nature of that threat. For example, these same \\\\nadversaries are likely to use generative artificial \\\\nintelligence tools and strategies to improve the quality, \\\\nscope, and scale of their influence operations. The wide-spread \\\\nproliferation and accessibility of these AI tools will boost \\\\nforeign malign influence campaigns by enabling threat actors to \\\\ncreate synthetic text, audio, and images at a lower cost and \\\\nwith higher quality.\\\\n    DHS is charged with safeguarding the United States against \\\\nthreats to its security. In recent years, many of those threats \\\\nhave been exacerbated by disinformation. As part of its \\\\nmission, DHS has worked across multiple administrations to \\\\naddress and mitigate different forms of disinformation that \\\\nthreaten authorized missions of the Department. Examples of \\\\nsuch efforts include working to combat human smuggling, \\\\nprotecting critical infrastructure, and responding to foreign \\\\nmalign influence. In the context of these threats, the \\\\nDepartment takes seriously our responsibility to safeguard the \\\\nUnited States, its people, and its values. Providing the public \\\\nwith accurate information in response to foreign malign \\\\ninfluence campaigns is critical to fulfilling DHS&#x27;s \\\\nCongressionally-mandated mission.\\\\n    The Department is committed to carrying out its mission in \\\\na way that ensures that privacy, civil rights, and civil \\\\nliberties are protected for all Americans. This includes the \\\\nfreedom of speech. These rights are fundamental to our freedom \\\\nand to who we are as a Nation. Like everything we do, the work \\\\nof DHS to address foreign influence operations must be \\\\nconsistent with the Constitution and in compliance with U.S. \\\\nlaws, regulations, and policies. The Department works every day \\\\nto ensure that all of our activities are carried out in a \\\\nmanner that protects these values. DHS is committed to \\\\ncontinuing to build resilience to foreign influence operations \\\\nand disinformation in close coordination with our interagency \\\\npartners. In these efforts, DHS will continue operating within \\\\nour authority in accordance with all legal requirements with \\\\nrespect for the Constitutional rights and civil liberties of \\\\nall Americans.\\\\n    I thank you again for the opportunity to testify here \\\\ntoday, and I look forward to taking your questions.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    [The joint prepared statement of Mr. Kahangama and Ms. \\\\nHarrington follows:]\\\\n    Joint Prepared Statement of Iranga Kahangama and Mona Harrington\\\\n                           December 13, 2023\\\\n                              introduction\\\\n    Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the \\\\nsubcommittee, we appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today \\\\nto discuss the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s (DHS or the \\\\nDepartment) efforts to counter the impacts of foreign influence \\\\noperations and disinformation impacting homeland security.\\\\n    First and foremost, at the core of the Department&#x27;s mission is a \\\\ncommitment to safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our \\\\nvalues. We are committed to carrying out this mission in a manner that \\\\nprotects the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, including the \\\\nfreedom of speech, of all Americans. These rights are fundamental to \\\\nour freedom and to who we are as a Nation. The Department works every \\\\nday to ensure that all our activities are carried out in a manner that \\\\nprotects these values.\\\\n    In its Homeland Threat Assessment for 2024, the Department&#x27;s \\\\nIntelligence Enterprise assesses Russia, China, and Iran likely see the \\\\nupcoming election season in 2024 as an opportunity to conduct overt and \\\\ncovert influence campaigns aimed at shaping favorable U.S. policy \\\\noutcomes and undermining U.S. stability, and they will likely ramp up \\\\nthese efforts in advance of the election. These adversarial states are \\\\nlikely to use generative artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled \\\\ntechnologies to improve the quality, scope, and scale of their \\\\ninfluence operations targeting U.S. audiences.\\\\n    Further, nation-state adversaries likely will continue to conduct \\\\ninfluence operations aimed at undermining trust in Government \\\\ninstitutions, our social cohesion, and democratic processes. The \\\\nproliferation and accessibility of emergent cyber and AI tools probably \\\\nwill help these actors bolster their malign information campaigns by \\\\nenabling the creation of low-cost, synthetic text-, image-, and audio-\\\\nbased content with higher quality. Russia, China, and Iran continue to \\\\ndevelop the most sophisticated malign influence campaigns on-line. Many \\\\nof the tactics these adversaries use to influence U.S. audiences will \\\\nlikely be used in the lead-up to the 2024 election.\\\\n    This risk is not new. In its 2023 Annual Threat Assessment, the \\\\nU.S. intelligence community noted that China largely concentrates its \\\\nU.S.-focused influence efforts on shaping U.S. policy and the U.S. \\\\npublic&#x27;s perception of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in a \\\\npositive direction but has shown a willingness to meddle in select \\\\nelection races that involved perceived anti-PRC politicians. For \\\\nexample, Beijing&#x27;s growing efforts to actively exploit perceived U.S. \\\\nsocietal divisions using its on-line personas move it closer to \\\\nMoscow&#x27;s playbook for influence operations.\\\\n    Russia presents one of the most serious foreign influence threats \\\\nto the United States because it uses its intelligence services, \\\\nproxies, and wide-ranging influence tools to try to sow discord inside \\\\nthe United States. Moscow views U.S. elections as opportunities for \\\\nmalign influence as part of its larger foreign policy strategy. Moscow \\\\nhas conducted influence operations against U.S. elections for decades, \\\\nincluding as recently as the U.S. midterm elections in 2022. Russia&#x27;s \\\\ninfluence actors have adapted their efforts to increasingly hide their \\\\nhand, laundering their preferred messaging through a vast ecosystem of \\\\nRussian proxy websites, individuals, and organizations that appear to \\\\nbe independent sources.\\\\n                    election infrastructure mission\\\\n    In 2017, the Secretary of Homeland Security established election \\\\ninfrastructure as a critical infrastructure subsector. To manage risks \\\\nto the Nation&#x27;s election infrastructure on behalf of the Department, \\\\nthe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) works \\\\ncollaboratively with State and local governments, election officials, \\\\nFederal partners, and private-sector partners. The collaboration \\\\nincludes working in a nonpartisan, voluntary manner with State and \\\\nlocal election officials, who are the trusted and expert voices within \\\\ntheir communities, to hold secure elections in their jurisdictions and \\\\nto equip the American public with accurate information about the \\\\nconduct and security of elections.\\\\n    CISA provides publicly-available resources on election security for \\\\nboth the public and election officials in its efforts to protect \\\\nAmerica&#x27;s election infrastructure against new and evolving threats. For \\\\nexample, CISA recently publicly released the No Downtime in Elections \\\\nGuide to Mitigating Risks of Denial of Service. Moreover, CISA has \\\\npartnered with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to publish election \\\\nsecurity-related Public Service Advisories; and CISA has compiled a \\\\ntoolkit of free services and tools intended to help State and local \\\\ngovernment officials, election officials, and vendors enhance the \\\\ncybersecurity and cyber resilience of U.S. election infrastructure.\\\\n    CISA also provides numerous voluntary and no-cost election security \\\\nservices, such as cybersecurity assessments, cyber threat hunting, \\\\ncyber incident response, training, and exercises to State and local \\\\ngovernment officials and private-sector election infrastructure \\\\npartners. In addition, CISA reduces risk to U.S. critical \\\\ninfrastructure by building resilience to foreign influence operations \\\\nand disinformation intended to impact critical infrastructure.\\\\n    Through these efforts, DHS helps the American people understand the \\\\nscope and scale of activities targeting election infrastructure and \\\\nenables them to take action to mitigate associated risks. The \\\\nDepartment&#x27;s efforts include an emphasis on transparency with respect \\\\nto sharing accurate information about election infrastructure security, \\\\nas well as increasing awareness about the threat posed by foreign \\\\ninfluence operations and disinformation.\\\\n            foreign influence operations and disinformation\\\\n    DHS is charged with safeguarding the United States against threats \\\\nto its security. In recent years, many of those threats have been \\\\nexacerbated by disinformation. As part of its mission, DHS has worked \\\\nacross multiple administrations to address and mitigate different forms \\\\nof disinformation that threaten the authorized missions of the \\\\nDepartment. Countering disinformation that threatens the homeland and \\\\nproviding the public with accurate information in response are critical \\\\nto fulfilling DHS&#x27;s Congressionally-mandated missions. DHS efforts are \\\\nlimited to combating disinformation that threatens the homeland and \\\\nhomeland security missions, such as border security, emergency \\\\nresponse, and infrastructure security. Examples of such efforts include \\\\nworking to combat human smuggling, protecting critical infrastructure, \\\\nand responding to malign foreign influence efforts.\\\\n    CISA&#x27;s work on foreign influence operations and disinformation \\\\ntargeting election infrastructure is of limited scope and focuses \\\\npredominantly on its impact to public confidence in election \\\\ninfrastructure security. Out of CISA&#x27;s $2.9 billion budget, less than \\\\n0.07 percent is spent on these efforts. CISA&#x27;s work has been \\\\ntransparent, briefed to Congress many times, and is available to the \\\\npublic on its website at cisa.gov.\\\\n    In support of these efforts, CISA has developed voluntary resources \\\\nto help individuals identify and mitigate the threats of foreign \\\\ninfluence and disinformation operations. Recently, CISA has released \\\\nguides that highlight tactics, such as manipulating content service \\\\nproviders or defacing public websites, used by foreign actors engaged \\\\nin disinformation campaigns that seek to negatively impact U.S. \\\\ncritical infrastructure and disrupt American life. Such public products \\\\nhelp Americans understand how automated programs like social media bots \\\\nsimulate human behavior on social media platforms and how foreign \\\\nmalign actors use them to spread false or misleading information, shut \\\\ndown opposition, and elevate their own platforms for further \\\\nmanipulation.\\\\n    Additionally, CISA provides context to common disinformation \\\\nnarratives and themes that relate to the security of election \\\\ninfrastructure through our Election Security Rumor vs. Reality website. \\\\nLast, CISA seeks to combat foreign disinformation by amplifying \\\\naccurate election security-related information shared by State and \\\\nlocal officials with the public.\\\\n                               conclusion\\\\n    DHS is committed to continuing to build resilience to foreign \\\\ninfluence operations and disinformation, in close coordination with our \\\\ninteragency partners. In these efforts, DHS will continue operating \\\\nwithin our authority and in accordance with all legal requirements, and \\\\nwith respect for the Constitutional rights and civil liberties of all \\\\nAmericans.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today, and \\\\nwe look forward to continuing to work closely with you to keep our \\\\nhomeland safe and secure.\\\\n\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Kahangama.\\\\n    I now recognize Ms. Harrington for 5 minutes for her \\\\nopening statement.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF MONA HARRINGTON, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, NATIONAL RISK \\\\n MANAGEMENT CENTER, CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY \\\\n          AGENCY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the \\\\nsubcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the \\\\nNational Risk Management Center&#x27;s efforts to build resilience \\\\nto the impacts of foreign influence, operations, and \\\\ndisinformation targeting election infrastructure.\\\\n    First and foremost, at the core of the Department&#x27;s mission \\\\nis a commitment to safeguard the American people, our homeland, \\\\nand our values. We carry out this mission in a manner that \\\\nprotects privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, including the \\\\nfreedom of speech of all Americans. These rights are \\\\nfundamental to our freedom and to who we are as a Nation.\\\\n    I began serving as the assistant director of the National \\\\nRisk Management Center, the NRMC, in October 2022. I have over \\\\n20 years of Federal Government experience working in different \\\\nleadership roles. My expertise spans cybersecurity, strategy, \\\\nrisk management, critical infrastructure, human capital \\\\noperations, and the implementation of best practices in \\\\ncritical infrastructure environments. I have led efforts to \\\\nfurther the NRMC&#x27;s critical analytics support to CISA&#x27;s mission \\\\nto understand, manage, and reduce risk to the cyber and \\\\nphysical infrastructure Americans rely on every day. Our work \\\\nenables CISA and other Federal, State, local, Tribal, \\\\nterritorial, and critical infrastructure partners to apply \\\\nactionable analysis in support of risk management decisions. \\\\nOver the last year, we have produced 1,600 tailored products \\\\nand engaged over 6,300 stakeholders to improve security of U.S. \\\\ncritical infrastructure.\\\\n    The election security and resilience team is one of many \\\\nefforts within the NRMC. The election security and resilience \\\\nteam works collaboratively with election officials, Federal, \\\\nand private-sector partners. The collaboration includes working \\\\nin a non-partisan manner on a voluntary basis with State and \\\\nlocal election officials to improve the security of election \\\\ninfrastructure necessary for the elections they are responsible \\\\nfor administering. CISA provides voluntary support to these \\\\nofficials with intelligence and information sharing, guidance, \\\\nand best practices, and no-cost security services such as cyber \\\\nincident response, cybersecurity assessments, and exercises.\\\\n    CISA&#x27;s work on foreign influence, operations, and \\\\ndisinformation is a very small part of the election security \\\\nand resilience team and it&#x27;s narrowly scoped. CISA&#x27;s work in \\\\nthis space includes developing publicly-available resources to \\\\ninform and assist stakeholders and the public. For example, we \\\\nreleased a guide that highlights tactics used by foreign \\\\nactors, such as manipulating content service providers or \\\\ndefacing public websites. These products are intended to build \\\\nawareness of how foreign malign actors spread false or \\\\nmisleading information. CISA&#x27;s work has been transparent, \\\\nbriefed to Congress many times, including this committee, and \\\\nis available to the public on its website at CISA.gov.\\\\n    Thank you again for this opportunity and I look forward to \\\\nyour questions.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Ms. Harrington.\\\\n    Members will now be recognized, by order of seniority for 5 \\\\nminutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning may \\\\nbe called after all Members have been recognized.\\\\n    I recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington, there was a CISA video on YouTube that had \\\\nthe fictional character--I think her name was Susan or Sharon--\\\\nand she said that the idea was that she had interacted with her \\\\nuncle on social media, he was posting things that were \\\\ndisinformation or mal information or something like that. It \\\\nconcluded with a recommendation that she report the \\\\ndisinformation from her uncle. CISA took that down. Why did \\\\nCISA take that video down?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, I&#x27;m not aware \\\\nof that. That must predate my time. I&#x27;m not at all familiar \\\\nwith that.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. How about Mr. Kahangama? Do you know what \\\\nI am talking about?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I&#x27;m not familiar with \\\\nthat video.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. All right. Let me ask you generally, Mr. \\\\nKahangama, and then I will go back to Ms. Harrington, how have \\\\nDHS and CISA&#x27;s efforts or activity concerning dealing with \\\\ndisinformation, misinformation, malinformation changed as in \\\\nconsequence of the Missouri v. Biden preliminary injunction \\\\nthat has been upheld by the Fifth Circuit or otherwise since \\\\nthe last election?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Thank you, Chair, for the question.\\\\n    While I understand and am aware of the Missouri v. Biden \\\\ncase, I understand that that is still on-going pending \\\\nlitigation in front of the Supreme Court and so I&#x27;m unable to \\\\nspeak to the specifics of that case.\\\\n    But what I will say is that the Department and its work in \\\\ncombating disinformation in defense of its specific mission \\\\narea is done with robust oversight in coordination with civil \\\\nrights and civil liberties, our statutorily-mandated offices, \\\\nas well as in close coordination with our Office of General \\\\nCounsel.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Well, see, that is what concerns me is \\\\nthat has been said to us for a number of years. In fact, it has \\\\nalways been said by CISA, by DHS, the recital that we are \\\\nconcerned about rights under the First Amendment and we always \\\\nare carefully taking action to avoid infringing those or \\\\nabridging free speech. Yet a District Court has found, and an \\\\nAppellate Court has affirmed that--and, of course, it is still \\\\npending for final determination, so I am not asking you about \\\\nthe facts or the determinations in that case, what I am asking \\\\nyou is--let me put it this way, because I asked you how things \\\\nhave changed, whether things have changed. Since that decision \\\\nhas been made has DHS changed the way it deals with \\\\ndisinformation?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Again, thank you for the question, Chair.\\\\n    I am not in a position to answer anything as it relates \\\\nspecific to the implications of that case.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. All right, let me ask this then. Since the \\\\nlast election--disregard the case if you want to--how is DHS \\\\ndealing with disinformation differently than it did then?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Thank you, Chair, for the question.\\\\n    DHS&#x27;s approach to election security has been around \\\\nelection infrastructure, making sure that they are preventing \\\\nthe infrastructure from being impacted by cybersecurity issues \\\\nand working to advance the mission of State and local partners \\\\nthat we trust as the authoritative voices on elections in this \\\\nelection space.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. But I didn&#x27;t ask you about how you are \\\\nprotecting elections infrastructure from hacking and so forth. \\\\nWhat I am asking you about are your efforts vis-a-vis \\\\ndisinformation.\\\\n    Let me just ask you, you still have an MDM team, don&#x27;t you?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. I do not have one at the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. All right, Ms. Harrington, is there still \\\\nan MDM team at CISA?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, yes, we still have an MDM \\\\nteam.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. How is the MDM team and the other efforts \\\\nrelating to the MDM team concerning disinformation, how have \\\\nyou changed those at CISA?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative the work that we do around \\\\nMDM are threefold. One, we are putting out literacy packets----\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. No, no, no, don&#x27;t give me a discourse \\\\nabout three with three parts. What I am asking is what has \\\\nchanged? What has changed, if anything? If you are proceeding \\\\nand dealing with disinformation in exactly the way you did \\\\nthen, which you have contended respects all First Amendment \\\\nrights, notwithstanding evidence to the contrary, say that. But \\\\notherwise, I want you to tell me how it has changed. How have \\\\nyou changed your practices in this area?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, I&#x27;m not aware \\\\nof direct changes to the on-going litigation.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. No, I am not trying to qualify in terms--\\\\nin fact, we covered that with Mr. Kahangama. What I am asking \\\\nis, leave aside the litigation, since the election in 2020, how \\\\nhave you changed, how has CISA changed the way you are dealing \\\\nwith disinformation?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, I can tell you the three \\\\nways that we deal with disinformation and counter foreign \\\\ninfluence, which are----\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. So you can&#x27;t tell me how you have changed \\\\nthem?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. First of all, going back to 2020, that \\\\npredates my tenure at the agency, but I&#x27;m happy to tell you \\\\nwhat we are doing.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Are you aware, by virtue of policies you \\\\nhave been exposed to, managerial discussions at CISA, whether \\\\nthere have been changes to the way CISA addresses \\\\ndisinformation?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative I&#x27;m not aware of what you&#x27;re \\\\nreferencing as far as changes.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK, you are not aware of any? That is \\\\nconcerning to me.\\\\n    By what justification does a Government agency tasked with \\\\ncurtailing and preventing computer hacking stray into governing \\\\nor babysitting Americans&#x27; free speech on social media?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, we don&#x27;t \\\\ncensor.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK. What is the source of authority for \\\\nDHS--Ms. Clarke said in her questioning on our first panel, and \\\\nI think she is exactly right, that CISA and--Excuse me, I see \\\\nmy time has expired and I have let it go over.\\\\n    Let me just stop there and yield back.\\\\n    I recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Ivey, for his 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. If I might, I would let Mr. Thanedar go.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Dr. Thanedar is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Thanedar. Chairman Bishop, thank you for holding this \\\\nhearing. Ranking Member Ivey, thank you for your incredible \\\\nkindness to let me speak here out of order. Maybe a little \\\\nearlier than I am supposed to, but thank you so much.\\\\n    Well, CISA has been incredibly transparent about its \\\\ninteractions with social media companies on the topic of \\\\nelection-related mis- and disinformation. In numerous hearings \\\\nbefore this committee and others, witnesses from CISA \\\\nrepeatedly told Congress that they were in regular \\\\ncommunication with social media companies and even told us that \\\\nthese companies were taking a very aggressive posture toward \\\\nelection-related misinformation.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop, I would like to enter into the record the \\\\ntranscripts of a hearing this committee held in 2019 regarding \\\\nhow CISA was preparing for the 2020 election.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Without objection, so ordered.*\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    * The document has been retained in committee files and is \\\\navailable at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-116hhrg40456/pdf/\\\\nCHRG-116hhrg40456.pdf.\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n    Mr. Thanedar. In fact, I think it is incredible--in fact, I \\\\nthink it is interesting that it was not until Donald Trump lost \\\\nthe 2020 election that my Republican colleagues began to take \\\\nissues with CISA&#x27;s disinformation activities.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington, can you speak to CISA&#x27;s transparency \\\\nefforts in this area and describe what the agency has done to \\\\nexplain to Congress, the media, and the public its election-\\\\nrelated disinformation work?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, thank you for the question.\\\\n    CISA has all of its materials on its website. We are \\\\nincredibly transparent. We have all of our publications \\\\nregarding disinformation, encountering foreign influence \\\\npublished publicly. All of that information can be found there. \\\\nWe regularly work with State and local partners. All of our \\\\npartnerships and communication around the work that we do can \\\\nbe found publicly, and it&#x27;s on our website.\\\\n    Mr. Thanedar. All right.\\\\n    Well, thank you so much. Thank you. Appreciate both of you \\\\nbeing here and for your testimony.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Thanedar.\\\\n    I recognize Mr. Ezell for his 5 minutes of questioning.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for being \\\\nhere today.\\\\n    Recently, documents were obtained under the Freedom of \\\\nInformation Act by Americans for Prosperity regarding DHS \\\\nDisinformation Governance Board, which was stood up by the \\\\nBiden administration and was almost immediately shut down due \\\\nto massive public pushback. Behind me today are two of these \\\\ndocuments. Well, besides the title, there isn&#x27;t much that we \\\\ncan learn from these documents.\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama, help me fill in some of the words on this \\\\nblank page. What authorities does DHS believe it has to counter \\\\nmisinformation, disinformation, and malinformation?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Thank you, representative, for the question.\\\\n    DHS believes its authorities to authorize its specific \\\\nmission use cases provides us the authority to provide correct \\\\naccurate information in response to false information that may \\\\ndirectly impact the operations of the Department.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Also behind me as well is a completely redacted \\\\nmemo titled ``Ukraine MDM Playbook&#x27;&#x27;. Do you think DHS has the \\\\nauthority to control public conversations on foreign wars? If \\\\nso, where do you believe this is under their mission?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Thank you for the question. Congressman.\\\\n    Could you please repeat the question?\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Do you think DHS has the authority to control \\\\npublic conversations on foreign wars?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. No, DHS does not have that authority. We do \\\\nnot monitor the content of American speech.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Is suppressing domestic speech included in the \\\\nmemos strategy?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. I&#x27;m sorry?\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Is suppressing domestic speech included in the \\\\nmemo&#x27;s strategy?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. I&#x27;m not familiar with the memo that you&#x27;re \\\\nreferencing.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee \\\\nrecommended to DHS that it should, ``bring disinformation to \\\\nthe attention of platforms hosting these falsehoods&#x27;&#x27;. I ask \\\\nthat DHS shares to the committee their communications with \\\\nthese platforms on this topic. Is that something you can \\\\nprovide?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Respectfully, Congressman, I would have to \\\\ndefer to our Office of Legislative Affairs, who I believe is \\\\nalready in contact with the committee staff about document \\\\nproduction and anything else that can be shared. But we&#x27;d be \\\\nhappy to.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington, does CISA have any plans to combat MDM \\\\nduring the 2024 election?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, CISA will \\\\ncontinue doing the work that it&#x27;s currently doing, which is \\\\nessentially amplifying election official voices. We have a \\\\nrumor control page up on CISA.gov, and we also are putting out \\\\nliteracy publications so the American people can spot \\\\ndisinformation tactics and learn about the tactics that foreign \\\\nadversaries are using to essentially spread disinformation.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.\\\\n    Recently, the director of CISA testified before Congress \\\\nthat ``The most critical infrastructure is our cognitive \\\\ninfrastructure. Building that resilience to misinformation and \\\\ndisinformation, I think is incredibly important&#x27;&#x27;. I want to \\\\nrepeat that again. The director of CISA testified before \\\\nCongress, and I quote, ``The most critical infrastructure is \\\\nour cognitive infrastructure. Building that resilience to \\\\nmisinformation and disinformation, I think is incredibly \\\\nimportant&#x27;&#x27;. I look at CISA&#x27;s website, and cognitive \\\\ninfrastructure is not listed as a sector CISA is tasked with \\\\nprotecting. What does cognitive infrastructure mean?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, in executing our mission we \\\\nare guided by the definition of critical infrastructure in \\\\nPresidential Policy Directive 21. That is, the U.S. Government \\\\ndetermines critical infrastructure by that PPD 21. There are 16 \\\\ncritical infrastructure sectors that are considered vital to \\\\nthe United States, includes their asset systems and networks, \\\\nwhether physical or virtual, that are so important that their \\\\nincapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect \\\\non security, National economic security, National public health \\\\nor safety, or any combination thereof.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Again, what does cognitive infrastructure mean? \\\\nI don&#x27;t get it.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, that is how \\\\nwe execute our mission, with the definition of critical \\\\ninfrastructure defined in PPD 21.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Do you think that DHS has this authority?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Our authorities are outlined in PPD 21.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. Have you discussed the cognitive infrastructure \\\\nwith Director Easterly?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, again, critical \\\\ninfrastructure is defined in PPD 21. It&#x27;s got the 16 sectors of \\\\nwhich are the sectors which make up critical infrastructure of \\\\nthe United States.\\\\n    Mr. Ezell. I am concerned that we continue to find examples \\\\nthat seem clear that the Biden administration is weaponizing \\\\nthe Federal Government against its citizens. These agencies are \\\\nout of control, and this committee will not stop until we hold \\\\nfolks accountable for that.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The gentlemen yields back.\\\\n    I recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Ivey, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    I just want a couple of follow-up points from our previous \\\\npanel. I did want to say we had a number of questions \\\\naddressing--or actually statements suggesting that the social \\\\nmedia platforms were coerced by the Government and that they \\\\ndidn&#x27;t have the ability to resist Government requests or \\\\nflagging of information. I did want to reiterate the point that \\\\nI made in my opening statement about how these social media \\\\nplatforms have dealt with this. So a post flag by the EIP, \\\\nElection Integrity Partnership, platforms took action on 35 \\\\npercent, 21 percent of those were labeled, 13 percent were \\\\nremoved, and 1 were left soft-blocked, which I believe means \\\\nthat they don&#x27;t permit the algorithm to allow it to go viral. \\\\nNo action was taken on 65 percent of these interactions. So we \\\\nmight disagree about whether they should be doing this or not, \\\\nbut I don&#x27;t think Elon Musk has had any trouble resisting or \\\\ndisagreeing with the Biden administration. My recollection from \\\\nwhen I worked with Microsoft was that they didn&#x27;t have trouble \\\\ndisagreeing with the Government at the time either. So.\\\\n    With respect to the issue about rumor control and \\\\ndisinformation tactics, Ms. Harrington, I wanted to ask you to \\\\nelaborate a little bit on that. What does that mean? What kinds \\\\nof activities are you taking or is your entity taking with \\\\nrespect to those kinds of situations?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, so we have a rumor control \\\\npage set up which helps to amplify election official voices. So \\\\nthe State and locals that are running the elections, we have a \\\\nnumber of rumor narratives and the reality providing factual \\\\ninformation. Again, that could be found transparently on our \\\\nwebsite. We work closely with State and local election \\\\nofficials, and we have that all cross-linked to, for example, \\\\nthe National Association of Secretaries of States, also the \\\\nNational Association of State Election Director websites, and \\\\nthere are a number of other sources, so that Americans can read \\\\nthat information and make their own decisions about the facts \\\\nsurrounding how election administration works.\\\\n    So that is one mechanism that we have where we amplify \\\\nelection official voices and put out actual information to \\\\neducate and ensure that we are putting out literacy information \\\\nto the American people to make good decisions.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. All right. So in Maryland, I believe we had a \\\\nmisinformation scenario that spread about the last day to \\\\nrequest a mail-in ballot and about the process of voting in \\\\nperson. Are those the types of scenarios that you are \\\\nreferencing, or would that be addressed by a different \\\\nmechanism?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, we don&#x27;t go into specific \\\\ndetail around the rules for each specific jurisdiction, if you \\\\nwill, but we have more broad narratives that are corrected on \\\\nthere. As you know, elections are decentralized, and each State \\\\nhas their own specific rules and requirements that govern how \\\\nthey run their elections. So we don&#x27;t get into that level of \\\\ngranularity, but more broad narratives.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Well, give me an example of a scenario where you \\\\nwould have gotten involved.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. So, for example, we have an entry on Rumor \\\\nvs. Reality that says voting system hardware and software \\\\nundergo testing from Federal, State, and/or election \\\\nauthorities. The rumor on that is that voting system software \\\\nis not at all reviewed or tested, period. So that would be an \\\\nexample of an entry, broad entry.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. All right. Then what would you do to address \\\\nthat? Or if that is actual, how did you respond?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. That&#x27;s an actual listing on the Rumor vs. \\\\nReality web page. So I&#x27;m just demonstrating the broad \\\\nnarratives that we try to correct.\\\\n    We have other entries on there, such as voters are \\\\nprotected by State and Federal law from threats or \\\\nintimidations at polls, including from election observers. So \\\\nthat&#x27;s another reality that we have on there. The rumor \\\\nassociated with that reality is observers in polling places are \\\\npermitted to intimidate voters, campaign, and or interfere with \\\\nvoting. So you could see they&#x27;re broad narratives that we just \\\\nput out to educate, but we don&#x27;t get into the granularity of \\\\nspecific jurisdictions, per your question.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. All right.\\\\n    Well, I see my time has expired, so I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Strong for 5 minutes of \\\\nquestioning.\\\\n    Mr. Strong. Thank you, Chairman Bishop.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington, at an event for the Center for Strategic \\\\nand International Studies on November 1, 2022, CISA Director \\\\nJen Easterly said, and I quote, ``We make sure people \\\\nunderstand the tactics around disinformation and that Americans \\\\nunderstand, you know, how to build resilience against it, how \\\\nto recognize it, how to investigate it, asking about the \\\\nsource, questioning it, not amplifying it&#x27;&#x27;. Who does CISA \\\\nsuggest as a credible source during these education efforts, \\\\nand how does CISA make that determination?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, could you please repeat the \\\\nquestion?\\\\n    Mr. Strong. How does CISA suggest a credible source during \\\\nthese educational efforts, and how does CISA make the \\\\ndetermination of that credible source?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Respectfully, I apologize. I still am not \\\\nclear on what your question is.\\\\n    Mr. Strong. OK. I will move further. Does CISA partner with \\\\nany outside experts or entities in developing its educational \\\\nMDM content? Do you use outside sources to do this effort?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, I just want to make sure \\\\nwe&#x27;re talking about the same thing. We put out literacy \\\\npublications to educate around disinformation, encountering \\\\nforeign influence tactics. They&#x27;re educational materials. They \\\\ncan be found on our website.\\\\n    Mr. Strong. Thank you. I appreciate that. My question is, \\\\ndo you use outside sources or do you do it all within your \\\\nteam?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, let me get back to your \\\\nstaff on that.\\\\n    Mr. Strong. I will reclaim my time. That is not a hard \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. I&#x27;m not certain if----\\\\n    Mr. Strong. I will make it easy. I will move on.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington [continuing]. There&#x27;s a contractor that \\\\nassists with publication.\\\\n    Mr. Strong. I will move on. Ms. Harrington, what types of \\\\nMDM efforts does CISA currently have under way? What type of \\\\nefforts?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, the three efforts that we \\\\nhave and that we continue to work on, as I previously stated, \\\\nare the rumor control page, and I gave some examples just a \\\\nmoment ago, literacy publications. We&#x27;ve got things like \\\\ntactics of disinformation, disinformation stops with you, other \\\\ninfographics, social media bots, infographic set, optical \\\\nillusions, other publications that you can find on our website. \\\\nWe amplify election official voices as the State and locals who \\\\nknow best how their processes and systems work.\\\\n    Those are the three efforts that CISA has within the \\\\ndisinformation, countering foreign influence.\\\\n    Mr. Strong. Thank you.\\\\n    Does CISA work with other DHS components on combating MDM? \\\\nIf they do, which ones do they work with?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, I&#x27;m not aware \\\\nof any coordination across other components.\\\\n    Mr. Strong. Thank you.\\\\n    Sir, the next question. On November the 15th of this year \\\\nyou spoke at an Aspen Institute summit where you said that DHS \\\\nhas many different operational applications of AI that we are \\\\nactively using, whether that is generative AI or more \\\\ntraditional machine learning. What operation using AI has DHS \\\\nalready undertaken? What are they already doing?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Thank you, representative. Thank you for the \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Obviously, generative AI has been very much popular in the \\\\nnews and so this has been a really interesting space for us to \\\\ndo a lot of work for the Department operationally across many \\\\nof the components. Our OCIO recently put out some guidance \\\\nabout how employees can propose projects and to use AI as a \\\\nmeans to make work more efficient and a better use of an \\\\nemployee&#x27;s time.\\\\n    For instance, on the cybersecurity mission, when we are \\\\nworking to protect Federal networks, we can apply machine \\\\nlearning so that we can inject indicators of compromise, \\\\nmalware samples, computer viruses. We can use machine learning \\\\nand AI tools to automate that so that we&#x27;re more able to \\\\nquickly identify where vulnerabilities may exist and how to \\\\npatch them.\\\\n    We also want to explore the ability to use AI in different \\\\nmission spaces. Our Homeland Security Investigations is using \\\\nit on the countering child sex exploitation and CSAN material, \\\\nthat we can better identify victims and protect those \\\\ncommunities using artificial intelligence. We also have pilots \\\\ngoing where we want to use them on the border to better scan \\\\nfor goods in the customs and border protection mission.\\\\n    So we have a lot of actual good news stories in this space \\\\nthat we&#x27;re excited about.\\\\n    Mr. Strong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Crane for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    This is for both of you. Were you here for the panel prior?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. We were in another room, but we were able \\\\nto watch some of it on the TV.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. OK.\\\\n    I am going to start with you, Mr. K. I will just say Mr. K. \\\\nIs that all right? Go ahead and tell me how to pronounce it.\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. You could say Kahangama.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Kahangama. OK.\\\\n    Do you trust the Government to censor American speech?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Respectfully, Congressman, the Department of \\\\nHomeland Security does not censor content.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. OK. Did you hear Mr. Shellenberger&#x27;s evidence \\\\nabout how our Government was using some of its institutions and \\\\norganizations to censor the speech of Americans on social \\\\nmedia? Were you here for that?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. I saw the hearing, the first part, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. OK. So are you arguing that that wasn&#x27;t \\\\ncensorship?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. I&#x27;m not familiar with what exactly you&#x27;re \\\\nreferencing.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. OK. Well, he had emails going from our \\\\nGovernment to social media platforms flagging and requesting \\\\nthe removal of social media posts. Do you classify that as \\\\ncensorship?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. So while I heard the testimony of Mr. \\\\nShellenberger, I haven&#x27;t reviewed the specific documents that \\\\nyou are referencing, so I can&#x27;t speak to the veracity of them.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. OK. Well, let&#x27;s just go general then. Do you \\\\nthink that it is censorship for the Federal Government to be \\\\nreaching out to social media platforms and asking them to \\\\nremove postings from American citizens?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Thank you, Congressman.\\\\n    I would reiterate that the Department of Homeland Security \\\\ndoes not engage in content moderation conversations with social \\\\nmedia companies.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. OK. That is not what I asked you.\\\\n    OK. Do you study history, Mr. K?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Generally.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Generally? OK. What about you, ma&#x27;am, Ms. \\\\nHarrington. Generally?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Generally.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. OK. Typically, what types of governments censor \\\\ntheir own people? Go ahead, either of you.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Authoritative?\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Yes. Sir?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Yes, I would agree.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Do totalitarian governments do that? Yes? No? It \\\\nis not hard.\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Broadly, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Do communistic governments do that? Socialistic \\\\ngovernments do that? Why do you think they do that? Why do they \\\\nthink that they try and control the speech of their own people? \\\\nMa&#x27;am? Ms. Harrington.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Yes, I think that&#x27;s correct, probably \\\\npolitical control.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Yes, absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. K.\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. Yes, I would agree.\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Do you think it is important that we try not to \\\\nbecome like them?\\\\n    Mr. Kahangama. I believe this Government is not like them. \\\\nI believe we are respectful of our Constitutional rights. We \\\\nensure that all the work that we are doing is protected by our \\\\ncivil liberties and civil rights offices, and we do that with \\\\nrespect to all of our freedoms, including----\\\\n    Mr. Crane. Well, thank you, but I would actually \\\\nrespectfully disagree with that point of view. As a matter of \\\\nfact, if you were paying attention to some of the evidence \\\\nproduced in the last panel, you would know that. As somebody \\\\nwho is involved in law enforcement, that was evidence, sir. \\\\nThat is what any law enforcement officer would consider \\\\nevidence. Those emails going from our Government to social \\\\nmedia platforms, flagging and requesting the removal of posts \\\\nand speech from American citizens. So you can sit there and you \\\\ncan give me all the little canned answers you want, but when \\\\nyou actually open your mind and are willing to look at the \\\\nevidence being presented, it is obvious.\\\\n    Now, this shouldn&#x27;t be a partisan issue. We all know that \\\\non this panel. It shouldn&#x27;t be a Democrat or Republican issue. \\\\nIt should be are we willing to become like other totalitarian \\\\ngovernments, communistic governments, socialistic governments \\\\nthat censor the speech of our own people. I hope you two take \\\\nthis very seriously, because I am sure that many of the people \\\\nthat have participated in some of these communistic, \\\\ntotalitarian governments in history felt like they were doing \\\\nthe right thing. So I hope that you guys take this very \\\\nseriously, and I hope you take our Constitution very seriously \\\\nand free speech. Because I will tell you this, it is most \\\\nimportant to protect free speech not when you agree with \\\\npeople, but when you disagree with them.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The gentlemen yields back.\\\\n    In the Chair&#x27;s discretion, we will do another round of \\\\nquestioning for the witnesses.\\\\n    So I will recognize myself for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington----\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Mr. Chairman, if I might, perhaps the Chair could \\\\ndo another round of questions.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. You don&#x27;t care to?\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. I do have some time constraints.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. No one has to stay. No one has to stay and \\\\nwe are not going to be long, but I have got another 5 minutes. \\\\nYou don&#x27;t have to stay.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. Yes, sir. No objection to that? No objection to \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. All right, good. Thank you, sir.\\\\n    It is at the election of every Member whether they have \\\\nfurther questions they want to ask.\\\\n    So the Chair will ask 5 minutes of questioning. If you will \\\\nrestore my time to 5 minutes, please.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington, you have referenced a number of times that \\\\nCISA operates a rumor control website where you correct things \\\\nyou have identified that are misinformation. You understand \\\\nfrom the prior testimony and the questions of Members, no one \\\\nhas an objection to CISA having a website publishing what it \\\\ncontends are corrections of rumors that are false? Right? You \\\\nunderstand that?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Yes.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Do you understand what the committee is \\\\nconcerned about in terms of CISA&#x27;s prior conduct? Are you \\\\nunaware of the subject matter that we are concerned about?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. I am aware. I&#x27;m aware of what you&#x27;re \\\\nconcerned about. Censorship, essentially. I am aware of that.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK. Do I understand your testimony \\\\npreviously be that CISA really hasn&#x27;t changed its policies to \\\\navoid censoring?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, we don&#x27;t \\\\ncensor.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. I can tell you what we are doing.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK. No, hold on a second.\\\\n    So do you know what switchboarding is?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. I was made familiar with that recently.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK. Did----\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. I was not at the agency when that----\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. I am really talking about CISA, not really \\\\ntalking about specific to your career, obviously. You are here \\\\nas a representative of CISA. Did CISA switchboard?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Yes.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. But please allow me to explain what I \\\\nunderstand that----\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Well, I just want to know, because I \\\\nunderstand we may get lost in exactly what switchboarding kind-\\\\nof includes, but you have a notion in your mind of what it is. \\\\nIs CISA continuing to switchboard?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. CISA is not switchboarding. CISA is not \\\\nsending emails on behalf of election officials from both \\\\nparties to social media companies.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. That is not happening.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. When did CISA stop switchboarding?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. My understanding, although it predates me, \\\\nis that CISA stopped after the 2020 cycle.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Why did it stop?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, again, this \\\\npredates me, but my understanding is that CISA makes decisions \\\\nto prioritize efforts based on where the most impact is and to \\\\nalign resources with priorities. That was an agency decision. \\\\nAgain, that predates me, but my understanding is it has stopped \\\\nand it is no longer happening now and it stopped in the 2020 \\\\ncycle.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. See, my concern is if CISA stopped \\\\nswitchboarding because it thought switchboarding was a \\\\nquestionable practice or one that was exceedingly disapproved \\\\nof, then that might satisfy me more. But what I understand you \\\\nare saying is it is simply a resource allocation or \\\\nprioritization determination, so you could resume \\\\nswitchboarding next week if you want to. Is that what you \\\\nthink?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, I understand \\\\nthat was an agency decision. Again, it predates me and that \\\\nactivity is not occurring.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Yes, but that is not what I asked you. I \\\\nasked you whether you believe it to be true that CISA could \\\\nresume switchboarding next week.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, again, switchboarding is \\\\nnot occurring and that stopped in the 2020 cycle. Forwarding \\\\nemails to social--a limited number of emails from both parties \\\\nto social media companies is not happening.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. In that case--you would agree with me, \\\\nwould you not, that there is no reason that Congress shouldn&#x27;t \\\\nrestrict CISA&#x27;s authority to make sure that it cannot \\\\nswitchboard? Since you are not doing it, right?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, we are not censoring.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. So we can provide that in law, make sure \\\\nthat that is a clear guardrail, correct?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, respectfully, it is already \\\\nin law.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Oh, really?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. That we shouldn&#x27;t censor? It is the First \\\\nAmendment.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. That you shouldn&#x27;t switchboard. I agree. I \\\\nmean, you have kind-of hit the nail on the head with that last \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. We are not censoring----\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Because the problem is----\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. CISA doesn&#x27;t censor.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. The problem is whether switchboarding is \\\\ncensoring, and I think you just conflated the two, which is \\\\nexactly the problem.\\\\n    Let me ask this question. Is CISA meeting on a regular \\\\nbasis with social media platforms?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. CISA does not meet with social media \\\\nplatforms.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. You said does not. Did it meet with social \\\\nmedia platforms on a periodic basis?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. I understand that it was meeting with them \\\\nat a time, yes.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Monthly and then weekly during the run-up \\\\nto the 2020 elections, correct?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. I am not certain on completely what that \\\\ncadence is.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. OK. I will represent to you that that is \\\\nwhat it was since you don&#x27;t know, but you should. They met with \\\\nthem monthly and then weekly leading up to the 2020 elections. \\\\nAre those sorts of periodic meetings with social media \\\\ncompanies still going on?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Representative, CISA is not meeting with \\\\nsocial media companies.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Why did you stop?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. I understand that that activity stopped in \\\\nOctober 2022.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. Why?\\\\n    Ms. Harrington. Because the staff were communicating \\\\ninformation to interagency partners as well as social media \\\\ncompanies on basic 101 election information and it was not good \\\\nuse of their time given other priorities that would yield an \\\\nimpact.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. All right.\\\\n    My 5 minutes of questioning. The second round has expired.\\\\n    Mr. Ivey, you don&#x27;t have further questions?\\\\n    Mr. Ivey. No, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman Bishop. All right.\\\\n    In that case, I thank these witnesses for your valuable \\\\ntestimony and the Members for their questions.\\\\n    The Members of the subcommittee may have additional \\\\nquestions for the witnesses and would ask the witnesses to \\\\nrespond to those in writing. Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), \\\\nthe hearing record will be held open for 10 days.\\\\n    Without objection, this subcommittee stands adjourned.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 4:17 p.m., the

Roger Williams \\\\n[chairman of the Committee] presiding.\\\\n    Present: Representatives Williams, Luetkemeyer, Stauber, \\\\nMeuser, Van Duyne, Salazar, Mann, Ellzey, Molinaro, Alford, \\\\nCrane, Bean, Hunt, LaLota, Maloy, Velazquez, Golden, McGarvey, \\\\nGluesenkamp Perez, Scholten, Thanedar, and Davids.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Committee will come to order. \\\\nWithout objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess \\\\nof the Committee at any time.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for my opening statement.\\\\n    Welcome to today&#x27;s hearing, which will focus on examining \\\\nthe impact of burdensome EPA regulations on main street. I \\\\nwould like to start off by thanking our witnesses for joining \\\\nus today. You all have traveled a long way to be with us this \\\\nmorning, and we appreciate your attendance and appreciate your \\\\ninput.\\\\n    When I travel around and speak to small businesses, I hear \\\\nall the time how the cost of everything is so high. From the \\\\nprice of utilities to their labor costs, businesses feel like \\\\nthey are struggling to get ahead. Unfortunately, there is \\\\nanother new aspect that has made their operations even more \\\\nchallenging over the last 3 years, and that is the increased \\\\ncost of complying with regulations.\\\\n    Most small businesses do not have a team of lawyers or a \\\\ncompliance department to look through all the new mandates \\\\ncoming out of Washington, D.C. Figuring out what needs to be \\\\ndone in order to comply takes time away from the employees or \\\\nowner that could be better spent looking for growth \\\\nopportunities or doing other revenue-generating activities.\\\\n    Now, while there are laws on the books that are supposed to \\\\nprotect small businesses from the worst of these regulations, \\\\nthey seem to be failing. Since President Biden was sworn into \\\\noffice, his administration has issued 766 final rules costing \\\\nover $450 billion to Main Street America. This type of \\\\noverregulation has real world consequences on American small \\\\nbusinesses.\\\\n    Of all the agencies creating the increased burden on Main \\\\nStreet America, it is the EPA and has been one of the worst \\\\noffenders. This agency has taken a radical approach of \\\\nenvironmental extremism over practical policies to promote the \\\\nenvironment. Some of the EPA&#x27;s rules, which we will examine in \\\\nmore detail today, would have drastic impacts in a variety of \\\\ndifferent industries throughout our country. In some of the \\\\nmost extreme examples, entire industries would be regulated out \\\\nof existence. This Agency takes a heavy-handed government \\\\napproach to force change, rather than letting free markets and \\\\nbusinesses make their own decisions.\\\\n    And additional unintended consequence of these overbearing \\\\nEPA regulations is that not only do they harm America&#x27;s \\\\nbusinesses, but they also put us at a competitive disadvantage \\\\nwith our adversaries, like China. For example, the EPA is \\\\ndetermined to force a transition to clean alternatives by \\\\nregulating coal, oil, and gas companies into oblivion, thus \\\\nmaking their product more expensive and less competitive in the \\\\nmarket. Meanwhile, China&#x27;s focused on building whatever types \\\\nof power plants are needed to satisfy their demand.\\\\n    And outside of being the voice for main street and \\\\nCongress, this Committee&#x27;s top priority is to hold agencies \\\\naccountable for impacts of rules and regulations on Main Street \\\\nAmerica. We have sent five oversight letters to the EPA \\\\nsounding the alarm on the negative impacts of their rules. And \\\\nunfortunately, many of their responses are untimely and all of \\\\nthem are lacking in sufficient detail.\\\\n    So, to ensure main street can thrive, our agencies need to \\\\nlisten to small businesses during the rulemaking process. After \\\\nall, the government should be in the business of working for \\\\nthe people, not against the people. And entrepreneurs have all \\\\nendured significant challenges over the past few years, and I \\\\nhope this hearing spotlights where the EPA has gone wrong and \\\\nmore importantly, what can we do to fix it?\\\\n    So lastly, I ask unanimous consent to submit documents for \\\\nthe record for the American Chemistry Council and the National \\\\nSandstone and Gravel Association. Without objection, so \\\\nordered.\\\\n    So thank you again for all of the witnesses being here \\\\ntoday. I am very much looking forward to our conversation.\\\\n    And with that, I yield to our distinguished Ranking Member, \\\\nMs. Velazquez, from the great State of New York.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to \\\\nall the witnesses for being here today.\\\\n    The hearing we are holding today will focus on the impact \\\\nof EPA&#x27;s rules on small businesses. It is the third hearing in \\\\na series on regulation. While we have heard that complying with \\\\nfederal, state, and local rules can be onerous for small \\\\nbusiness owners, we also heard that smart, well-crafted \\\\nregulations can level the playing field and help small \\\\nbusinesses compete against larger corporations.\\\\n    Most importantly, small businesses want their voices to be \\\\nheard during the rulemaking process, and they need compliance \\\\nassistance. That is why Congress enacted the Regulatory \\\\nFlexibility Act and established the Office of Advocacy and the \\\\nNational Ombudsman. The role of advocacy is to monitor the \\\\nrule-writing process and ensure agencies listens to the \\\\nconcerns of small businesses. The role of the National \\\\nOmbudsman is to assist with excessive regulatory issues.\\\\n    They also make sure that agencies offer small businesses \\\\ntimely compliance assistance materials. It is important to note \\\\nthat both of these offices gave the Environmental Protection \\\\nAgency an A for their compliance with the Regulatory \\\\nFlexibility Act.\\\\n    We can all agree that regulations are vital to Americans \\\\nand small businesses. EPA&#x27;s rules safeguard our nation&#x27;s air, \\\\nlands, and waters, and they yield more benefits for Americans \\\\nthan any other agency. In fact, the benefits outweighed the \\\\ncost by a ratio of 13-to-1.\\\\n    However, we may hear claims today that EPA is running amok \\\\nand the regulations stifle the growth of small businesses. I \\\\ndisagree.\\\\n    First and foremost, the agency is carrying out our laws, \\\\nthe laws that Congress passed. The EPA has to operate within \\\\nthe statutory guidelines, involve public participation, respond \\\\nto comments, ensure the benefits, justify the costs, and follow \\\\nthe procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedures \\\\nAct and RFA. Put simply, there is no overreach. The EPA is \\\\ndoing what Congress asked them to do.\\\\n    Secondly, between the passage of the Clean Air Act and \\\\n2022, air pollution dropped by 78 percent and the economy grew. \\\\nSmart, well-crafted regulation can spur innovation and the \\\\ndevelopment of new clean technologies.\\\\n    New opportunities abound for entrepreneurs to produce \\\\nmaterials in cleaner ways. We cannot get stuck on the message \\\\nthat regulations hinder the growth of small businesses. We must \\\\nlook to the future and understand that regulations can drive \\\\ninnovation and grow the economy and protect public health and \\\\nour environment at the same time.\\\\n    I would like to enter into the record testimony from Dr. \\\\nLemir Teron. Dr. Teron aptly points out the consequences of \\\\nenvironmental pollution and their contribution to a long \\\\nhistory of environmental racism and inequality. Research has \\\\nshown that large polluting facilities expose frontline \\\\ncommunities made up of African American and other socially and \\\\neconomically disadvantaged groups to their dangerous levels of \\\\npollution. This aspect cannot be overlooked in our discussion \\\\ntoday, particularly for small businesses in this community.\\\\n    With that, I look forward to hearing from the witnesses \\\\ntoday about EPA&#x27;s rule and hearing more about their experiences \\\\nwith the agency, the Office of Advocacy, and the National \\\\nOmbudsman Office. It is important to know what we can do better \\\\nto help you succeed.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The Ranking Member yields back. I now \\\\nwill introduce our witnesses.\\\\n    Our first witness here with us today is Mr. Brandon Farris. \\\\nMr. Farris is the vice president of domestic economic policy \\\\nfor the National Association of Manufacturers, also known as \\\\nNAM, located here in Washington D.C. Prior to joining NAM, Mr. \\\\nFarris was the head of federal government regulations for The \\\\nChemours Company, where he played an integral role in the \\\\npassage of the AIM Act.\\\\n    After serving in the Marine Corps Reserves, thank you for \\\\nthat, he began his career in Washington as Bryce Harlow \\\\nFoundation Fellow at the George Washington University School of \\\\nLaw, while working on the U.S. House Agricultural Committee.\\\\n    Mr. Farris attended the Virginia Military Institute where \\\\nhe earned his bachelor of arts in history and philosophy before \\\\nattending the Johns Hopkins University where he received his \\\\nmaster of arts in government. He also holds a JD from the \\\\nGeorge Washington University Law School.\\\\n    I want to thank you for joining us today and look forward \\\\nto conversing.\\\\n    Our next witness here with us today is Ms. Cye Cooper \\\\nWagner.

Good morning. Chairman Williams, Ranking Member \\\\nVelazquez, Members of the Committee, thank you for the chance \\\\nto speak with you on behalf of the 13 million people who make \\\\nthings in America to convey the urgency of halting the \\\\nregulatory onslaught.\\\\n    Small businesses are essential for our economy. They \\\\naccount for 44 percent of U.S. economic activity. In the \\\\nmanufacturing sector, the majority of firms are small and \\\\nfunction as the backbone of the manufacturing supply chain. Yet \\\\nmanufacturing is facing significant headwinds in the form of \\\\nthe cost, complexity, and uncertainty associated with a new \\\\nwave of overreaching and burdensome federal regulations.\\\\n    The NAM commissioned a study which found that the total \\\\ncost of federal regulations is over $3 trillion, an amount \\\\nequal to 12 percent of our GDP. The average U.S. company pays \\\\napproximately $13,000 per employee per year to comply with \\\\nfederal regulations, yet the burden is substantially higher for \\\\nmanufacturers, especially small ones. U.S. manufacturers with \\\\nfewer than 50 employees incur regulatory compliance costs of an \\\\nestimated $50,000 per employee per year. This is more than \\\\nthree times the cost borne by the average U.S. company, money \\\\nthat would be much better spent investing in new machinery, \\\\nhiring more workers, or developing new and innovative products.\\\\n    The NAM analysis only reflects regulations in place as of \\\\n2022, but new proposed regulations have been especially \\\\ndisruptive and will further chill manufacturing growth. For \\\\nexample, the EPA recently finalized an early reconsideration of \\\\nthe particulate matter air quality standards. These revised \\\\nstandards will create permitting gridlock throughout the \\\\ncountry as permit applicants will have to model the new \\\\nstandard within 60 days. It leaves little room for industrial \\\\nactivity, as EPA itself concedes that as much as 70 percent of \\\\nparticulate matter comes from non manufacturing sources.\\\\n    Ultimately, states are going to have to ration which new \\\\ninvestments should be allowed to break ground to avoid falling \\\\ninto nonattainment. Needless to say, this regulation will cut \\\\nmanufacturing investment directly and potentially drive \\\\ncutting-edge factories to other nations with less onerous \\\\nstandards.\\\\n    This is just one example of an Agency action that will have \\\\nfar reaching effects across the manufacturing economy. Many \\\\nother proposals are moving forward towards finalization.\\\\n    The EPA has just proposed a burdensome reporting \\\\nrequirements and actions that will restrict or create de facto \\\\nbans on PFAS production or use. The issue is that for many of \\\\nthe current uses, semiconductors, EV batteries, medical \\\\ndevices, items for national defense, there are no existing \\\\nreplacements for PFAS. These proposed restrictions would force \\\\nmanufacturers to abandon domestic production of critical items \\\\nand instead rely on foreign production.\\\\n    Another proposed EPA regulation would impose new \\\\nrequirements on natural gas and coal power plants, which \\\\naccount for more than 60 percent of our total power generation. \\\\nNoncompliant facilities will be shut down.\\\\n    In another instance, the EPA has proposed regulations at \\\\nlevels so low it would create a de facto ban on the production \\\\nand use of ethylene oxide, which is used to sterilize medical \\\\ndevices, including PPE used by doctors and hospitals.\\\\n    The EPA has also proposed additional barriers to its review \\\\nunder the TSCA program, which is critical to innovation. Under \\\\nTSCA, the EPA is mandated to review new chemical applications \\\\nwithin 90 days. However, the vast majority of these take much \\\\nlonger, and the new requirements may further extend that \\\\napproval period, delaying deployment of new, efficient \\\\nproducts.\\\\n    Small businesses are vital to our economy and our lives. If \\\\nwe fail to reduce the regulatory burden on them, the U.S. is at \\\\nrisk of threatening the spirit that has allowed small \\\\nbusinesses to thrive. On the other hand, if we reduce their \\\\nburdens and their cost, there is no limit to what small \\\\nbusinesses can accomplish.\\\\n    Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. I recognize Ms. Wagner for her 5-minute \\\\nopening remarks.\\\\n\\\\n        STATEMENT OF CYE COOPER WAGNER, VICE PRESIDENT,\\\\n               EXPLORATION, COOPER OIL AND GAS\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, \\\\nesteemed Members of the Committee. It is an honor to be able to \\\\nspeak with you today.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the introduction. And that is \\\\nquite enough about me. Let&#x27;s talk about my small business.\\\\n    I am a second generation E&amp;P operator. We are based in Fort \\\\nWorth, Texas, and the majority of our production is in north \\\\ncentral Texas, in rural areas where I grew up. I graduated from \\\\na high school class of about 30 kids and went off down to Texas \\\\nA&amp;M and got an engineering degree. And after working for some \\\\ngreat esteemed, large independent companies and even a super \\\\nmajor during college, I landed back in Fort Worth with a small \\\\nindependent, and then came knocking on my dad&#x27;s door for a job \\\\nand I enjoy being the second generation running that company, \\\\nwhich I do now with my husband and my brother. So, a true \\\\nfamily business.\\\\n    We employ 11 people full-time. We have about 20 contractors \\\\nthat we hire on a month-to-month basis. And in addition, we, in \\\\n2023, sent 1099s to around 200 other contractors that the \\\\nmajority of their payroll, you know, is Joe Smith, LLC. It is \\\\njust Joe. He just comes and does all of the roustabout work or \\\\nanother type of repair work. His wife is a nurse in the local \\\\nhospital. She comes in and does the books at night.\\\\n    We are the lifeblood of the small rural communities where I \\\\nwas born and raised. We have a significant community impact as \\\\na company. Not only do the taxes from our wells, the ad valorem \\\\ntaxes, the property taxes, go straight to the rural hospitals, \\\\nthe school district, and the local communities. But we are very \\\\nactive members in the lifeblood that keeps these rural areas \\\\nthriving.\\\\n    We sponsor the county stock shows, the Little League teams, \\\\nthe volunteer fire departments, because there is no full-time \\\\nstaffed fire department in these rural areas. The towns are a \\\\nsize of 200 to a couple thousand people. We are one of the \\\\nlargest employer in almost a four-county area to offer 401(k), \\\\nhealth insurance, paid leave. Our company is a vital piece of \\\\nthe micro economy of these rural areas.\\\\n    And while I am pleased to be here today to share what is \\\\nprobably a unique perspective, because not only am I a second \\\\ngeneration E&amp;P mom-and-pop oil and gas operator, I am a fifth \\\\ngeneration farmer and rancher. So stewardship of natural \\\\nresources is in my veins. It runs through my blood.\\\\n    I am a staunch supporter of clean air, clean water, and \\\\ncaring for the lands on which we provide these natural \\\\nresources to America. It is a message that I tell my kids \\\\ndaily. My two young children are frequently riding around with \\\\nmy husband and I in rural areas and on our ranch. And I say, \\\\nthis is how we farm this wheat crop responsibly. This is how we \\\\nraise these thousands of cattle, all natural, with no steroids \\\\nor antibiotics, and care for the water they drink, the air that \\\\nthey breathe, and the land that they graze. This is how we \\\\nhunt, fish, and manage the game responsibly on this property, \\\\nand do so, so that we can continue to do that for generations \\\\nto come. And these are the oil and gas wells that mommy and \\\\ndaddy drilled right here in the middle of it where your great \\\\ngrandparents still live.\\\\n    And I am not alone. While that may sound like a unique \\\\nperspective from the oil and gas industry, I am just a small \\\\nrepresentation of a very large swath of small to midsized \\\\noperators, not only in Texas, but when I was Chairman of the \\\\nBoard of the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, a 3,000 strong \\\\nmember organization in Texas, I was able to meet folks from all \\\\nover the country, from Kansas, Illinois, New Mexico, Oklahoma, \\\\nLouisiana, and learn they share the same small business ethos \\\\nand regulatory environments that I have in Texas.\\\\n    In that regulatory environment, I am mandated right now on \\\\nbasically three levels of regulation. We have state-mandated \\\\nregulation, federally delegated regulation to the state of \\\\nTexas, and also American Petroleum Institute standards for my \\\\nequipment for safety and emissions. In 2023, in oil and gas \\\\nfriendly Texas, in 365 days in a calendar year, I was inspected \\\\n297 times. I passed all of those inspections, some with \\\\nreinspections. And that is up in average from 215 inspections \\\\non average per year from August 1 of 2015.\\\\n    I am a proud member of a highly regulated industry. And \\\\nwithin those existing rules, the state of Texas has done great \\\\nthings. The oil and gas industry has done great things. We have \\\\nsextupled production, meaning a sixfold increase of production, \\\\nwith the same or lower greenhouse gas emissions than we have \\\\nhad since 2010.\\\\n    We are stewards, not wasters. The wells I operate are very \\\\nmarginal. They make an equivalent of five barrels of oil a day. \\\\nI do not have room to waste in my business. I have to monitor \\\\nevery single product that I produce because it is vital to be \\\\nable to give the good jobs and support the communities of which \\\\nI live in.\\\\n    The regulations on small business like mine provide \\\\ncertainty for me, my employees, and the communities we support. \\\\nI urge this Committee to please know that if you do not allow \\\\nmy company to continue to produce these viable in-demand \\\\nproducts in the cleanest and best ways that we do in the world, \\\\nyou will push these jobs and this environment overseas where \\\\nthey don&#x27;t do it cleaner because they don&#x27;t have an EPA, an \\\\nAPI, or a Texas Railroad Commission.\\\\n    Thank you so much.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back. And I now \\\\nrecognize Dr. Aklog for his 5-minute opening remarks.\\\\n\\\\n     STATEMENT OF DR. LISHAN AKLOG, MD, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO,  \\\\n                        PAVMED, INC.\\\\n\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. Good morning, Chairman Williams, Ranking Member \\\\nVelazquez, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting \\\\nme to testify today.\\\\n    My name is Dr. Leshan Aklog. I am a heart surgeon, medical \\\\ntechnology innovator, and small company chief executive. Last \\\\nsummer, I was honored to testify before the Subcommittee on \\\\nHealth on Medicare Coverage of Innovative Medical Devices. My \\\\ntestimony today focuses on upcoming EPA regulations on ethylene \\\\noxide, which is used to sterilize billions of medical devices a \\\\nyear.\\\\n    Although there is broad industry support for updated \\\\nregulations, EPA&#x27;s proposals are projected to greatly reduce \\\\nsterilization capacity and patient access to critical medical \\\\ndevices. I am here to provide my perspective as a surgeon and \\\\nsmall company chief executive. I am not an expert on \\\\nenvironmental science, toxicology, sterilization technology, or \\\\neven the deeper policy dimensions.\\\\n    Most lifesaving medical innovation happens at small \\\\ncompanies such as mine. Government can have a significant \\\\npositive impact on patient access to our innovations. For \\\\nexample, SBIR and STTR funding are a lifeline to early stage \\\\ncompanies, and I commend the House for reauthorizing these \\\\nprograms and for including innovation, fostering R&amp;D expensing \\\\nprovisions in the recent tax bill.\\\\n    I was also pleased that H.R. 1691, the innovation-focused \\\\nsubject of my testimony last summer made it out of Committee.\\\\n    Today, however, we address a proposed government action \\\\nwith a large potential negative impact, exposing millions of \\\\npatients to the risk of delayed care and even death. And I \\\\nassure you that is not hyperbole.\\\\n    Sterilization lies at the heart of medical device \\\\nmanufacturing. One of the most time-consuming and costly steps \\\\nof the FDA clearance process is sterilization validation. We \\\\nmust prove that the device possesses zero infectious risk to \\\\nthe patient and that sterilization does not damage or impair \\\\nits function. This is more difficult than it sounds. \\\\nSterilization using heat or radiation can damage intricate \\\\ncomponents and can&#x27;t penetrate the inner parts of a complex \\\\nassembly. Ethylene oxide gas, however, can sterilize every \\\\ninner surface of a device without damaging its structure or \\\\nfunction. It is the only available technique to sterilize the \\\\nmajority of medical devices.\\\\n    Let me offer an example from my own experience as a heart \\\\nsurgeon. Nearly a million patients per year receive lifesaving \\\\nartificial heart valves. They are marvels of modern medical \\\\ntechnology. Perfect sterilization is critical since artificial \\\\nheart valve infection is catastrophic and sometimes fatal. \\\\nEthylene oxide is the only available technique to sterilize an \\\\nartificial heart valve.\\\\n    A large percentage of heart valves are sterilized at a \\\\nsingle U.S. facility. The sudden closure of this facility, even \\\\ntemporarily, would be devastating and many patients would die.\\\\n    I also have experience with ethylene oxide sterilization as \\\\nan entrepreneur and chief executive.\\\\n    Our experience commercializing our EsoCheck device \\\\nillustrates the unique challenges small, innovative companies \\\\nface with sterilization. EsoCheck is a deceptively simple tool \\\\nwhich allows precise, targeted collection of lower esophageal \\\\ncells for precancer testing. It is performed in a doctor&#x27;s \\\\noffice in less than 2 minutes without anesthesia or sedation. A \\\\nsmall balloon attached to a thin catheter gently swabs cells \\\\nfrom the target area, and a capsule protects the sample as the \\\\ncatheter is withdrawn. EsoCheck&#x27;s gentle approach to \\\\nnoninvasive cell collection is a dramatic and elegant \\\\nimprovement over cruder, decades-old technology, which involves \\\\ndragging a Brillo pad-like sponge on a string indiscriminately \\\\nscraping cells from the stomach, esophagus, and mouth. It is a \\\\nbig advancement.\\\\n    EsoCheck&#x27;s initial FDA clearance required ethylene oxide \\\\nsterilization. Unlike large companies who can bring \\\\nsterilization in house, we are dependent on a small number of \\\\nthird party sterilization companies with limited capacity. We \\\\nare the lowest priority customers and as a result, experience \\\\nserious supply challenges as EsoCheck demand grew.\\\\n    To mitigate supply chain risk from proposed EPA \\\\nregulations, we decided to deploy precious resources and \\\\nsuccessfully resubmitted EsoCheck for FDA clearance as a \\\\nnonsterile device.\\\\n    The other products in our pipeline, however, must be \\\\ndelivered and remain at severe risk if EPA regulations move \\\\nforward as proposed. Although, as I noted, I am not an ethylene \\\\noxide sterilization expert, I am a mainstream small company \\\\nexecutive who is deeply concerned that pending EPA regulations, \\\\nif implemented as proposed, will have a devastating effect on \\\\npatient care.\\\\n    I am also first and foremost a physician and recently lost \\\\na family member to cancer. No one in this room is more \\\\ncommitted than I am to preventing cancer. Cancer prevention is \\\\nthe sole mission of Lucid Diagnostics, which occupies the \\\\nmajority of my professional time.\\\\n    As a first-generation American who fled political violence \\\\nin Ethiopia, I have faith that this great country, which has \\\\ngiven me boundless opportunities, can apply technology and \\\\ncommonsense solutions to address its challenges.\\\\n    Let me be blunt, as surgeons are prone to be, updated EPA \\\\nregulations require the surgical precision of a scalpel. We can \\\\nkeep communities safe without compromising patient access to \\\\ncritical devices. I implore this Committee in Congress to \\\\nurgently work with the EPA, FDA, and the medical technology \\\\nindustry to get the updated ethylene oxide regulations right. \\\\nPatient access to critical and lifesaving technologies depend \\\\non it. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you very much, Doctor.\\\\n    And I now recognize Mr. Green for his 5-minute opening \\\\nremarks.\\\\n\\\\n        STATEMENT OF MICHAEL GREEN,  DIRECTOR,  CLIMATE AND\\\\n          ENERGY POLICY, AMERICAN SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS NET-\\\\n          WORK\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Let me start by just saying happy Valentine&#x27;s \\\\nDay. Hopefully, you guys have a second to reach out to somebody \\\\nthat you love or think about them.\\\\n    Chairman Williams, Ranking Member Velazquez, and fellow \\\\nMembers, I welcome the opportunity to engage with your \\\\nCommittee to discuss the nature of regulatory policies coming \\\\nfrom the EPA and their impact on main street businesses. I have \\\\nthe opportunity today to represent the American Sustainable \\\\nBusiness Network and our hundred of membered businesses, \\\\nchambers of commerce, and affiliated groups spread across the \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    I also have the opportunity to speak to you from a unique \\\\nperspective of owning a small business that is on my \\\\ncommunity&#x27;s main street in Woodstock, Vermont. I would like to \\\\nstart with sharing the experience of our community this past \\\\nsummer when a series of irregular weather caused our second \\\\n100-year flooding event in the last 15 years. Between July 10 \\\\nand 11, we had nine inches of rainfall on the green mountain \\\\nspine. The waters rushed down in inundated towns across our \\\\nstate, causing widespread damage to businesses, farms and \\\\nhomes. My family was fortunate to be spared from the \\\\ndevastation experienced by my neighbor right next door and many \\\\nof the businesses in our community.\\\\n    On the morning of the 11th, people woke up across the state \\\\nto complete destruction as several communities were completely \\\\ncut off from rescue services with roads sucked into the raging \\\\nrapids. In Woodstock this storm not only flooded our \\\\nbusinesses, but it also wiped out our town&#x27;s public water and \\\\ndrinking supply in what should have been our busiest summer \\\\npeak season.\\\\n    This experience is not unique to Vermont. This is the same \\\\nstory of small businesses across the country as we learn to \\\\nadapt to climate change. We know that small businesses are \\\\ndisproportionately impacted by the threats of climate change \\\\ndue to their limited resources to absorb financial shocks from \\\\nsuch catastrophic events. A study by FEMA highlighted that 40 \\\\npercent of the small businesses never reopen following such a \\\\ndisaster. This is caused by a lack of ability to relocate our \\\\nbrick-and-mortar businesses, being locked into less diversified \\\\nsupply chains, and an inability to compete with large \\\\ncorporations in the global marketplace.\\\\n    Businesses are not only feeling the impact of the climate \\\\ncrisis through major flooding events, as many businesses are \\\\nalso forced to shutter their doors because of extreme heat and \\\\npoor air quality over this past summer. The impacts of \\\\nunchecked localized air pollutants have an impact on our \\\\nworkforce as they exasperate these issues and our customers and \\\\ncommunities as a whole, as they are either stuck inside at best \\\\nor struggling to breathe from asthma and acute pulmonary \\\\nimpacts of air pollution at worst. Strong EPA regulations, such \\\\nas the recent final rule on soot, play a critical role in \\\\nsafeguarding public health and reducing pollution related \\\\nillnesses, lowering our health care costs for our small \\\\nbusiness community.\\\\n    The EPA can also support main street businesses when they \\\\nare left powerless, facing the challenges outside their \\\\ncontrol. The Good Neighbor plan is a great example of this, as \\\\na policy protects companies from the pollution from faraway \\\\nfacilities that don&#x27;t mitigate their downstream effects. It \\\\nwould be almost impossible for a main street business to create \\\\nthese sort of protections in their own state, let alone to do \\\\nthis in a neighboring state.\\\\n    These are the threats that we should be focused on today, \\\\nand we should be discussing. For far too long, we have been fed \\\\nby a false narrative that environmental and public health \\\\nregulation hamper our economic growth. Experience shows the \\\\nexact opposite is true. EPA regulation and technical assistance \\\\ngrants open the door for innovation and investment into \\\\notherwise antiquated, polluting industry. This innovation \\\\ncreates jobs, aligns the marketplace with a healthier \\\\nenvironment, and the opportunity for growth.\\\\n    EPA regulations have often been a catalyst for innovation, \\\\ndriving both large and small businesses to develop, adopt, and \\\\nmarket environmental-friendly technologies and practices. This \\\\nhas created a wave across the country of clean technology, and \\\\nit makes it one of the fastest growing sectors in many of the \\\\nstates that have given it the opportunity.\\\\n    I would like to end my testimony today by challenging the \\\\npremise offered for our conversation. Main street businesses \\\\nare often the backbone of their local economy, especially in \\\\nsmall towns like mine. At the end of the day, we have to look \\\\nat our neighbors face to face. Main street business owners are \\\\noften compelled to pursue decisions based on what is right for \\\\ntheir community as they understand the delicate role for public \\\\nhealth and environment play in their strong community fabric.\\\\n    Plain and simple, we will choose stronger controls over \\\\nputting the local environment and public health at risk 10 out \\\\nof 10 times and side with the health and safety of future \\\\ngenerations. This is a different motive than the out of state, \\\\nshareholder-controlled polluting industries that are driven by \\\\nno other motive than profit.\\\\n    Time in today&#x27;s conversation would be best spent focusing \\\\non the resources needed to align with large point source \\\\npollution emitters, which I have never seen on a community&#x27;s \\\\nmain street in the first place, with what is best for our \\\\npublic health and our environment. I will continue to work with \\\\nthis Committee, as well as with the EPA to ensure that small \\\\nbusinesses are provided a seat at the table and push for the \\\\nstrongest protections possible for our environment, public \\\\nhealth.\\\\n    I welcome any questions. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Great job. And before we get started, I \\\\nwant to just say you will see Members moving in and out, \\\\ncoming, and eventually everybody will have worked their way \\\\nthrough here. But don&#x27;t take it personal, okay? We have got a \\\\nlot of Committees going on today, so that is important to know \\\\nthat.\\\\n    I now recognize myself for 5 minutes.\\\\n    In some cases, the EPA is so aggressive that they look to \\\\nregulate entire industries and rules out of existence. My \\\\nfamily has been in the automobile business for almost 89 years. \\\\nI have been in it 50 years. And we have never seen such an \\\\naggressive push to regulate tailpipe emissions and force the \\\\ntransition to electric vehicles.\\\\n    The problem with this is in Texas, there is no market, I \\\\nrepeat no market, for electric vehicles. People are looking for \\\\na car or truck that can pull a horse trailer or a boat hundreds \\\\nof miles and not have to be worried about finding a charging \\\\nstation and waiting a long time for electric vehicles to get \\\\ncharged back up. And the EPA doesn&#x27;t understand this. They just \\\\ndon&#x27;t. And they are trying to force this transition on the \\\\nmarket when the people simply should decide they want it or not \\\\nwant it and let the product sell on its own.\\\\n    So the oil and gas industry is currently seeing similar \\\\nhostilities, I believe, from this agency. So, Ms. Wagner, can \\\\nyou elaborate on the way the EPA treats the oil and gas \\\\nindustry compared to renewable energy companies? And what do \\\\nyou think the long-term impacts of this forced transition will \\\\nbe?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The difference between \\\\na lot of what you see in the green industry and the renewable \\\\nindustry, to which I am very familiar with, on one of our farms \\\\nand ranches, we have wind turbines on a ranch of ours that is \\\\nin my family land. So I have seen what happens when the big \\\\nrenewables come to the small towns and what they do and a big \\\\npush from the EPA and a lot of people that support more \\\\nregulation is that the jobs that will go away in my industry, \\\\nbecause of this duplicitous regulation that is coming.\\\\n    Like I mentioned in my testimony, I am highly regulated \\\\nalready. I am a marginal well producer. I know what resources \\\\nare coming out at the wellhead and what I am selling. And if \\\\nthere is a loss anywhere between those two points, I am looking \\\\nat it before any regulator because I cannot afford to have a \\\\nleak, a spill, or anything else. So these proposed regulations \\\\nare onerous and would cost the jobs in the community and the \\\\nlifeblood in those small towns.\\\\n    And when the big green companies come in, it is a temporary \\\\njob. A lot of people, you hear the rhetoric that there are \\\\ngreen jobs out there for everyone that leaves the oil and gas \\\\nindustry because fossil fuels are bad and they are all going \\\\naway. Well, we need fossil fuels. We need them for the medical \\\\nproducts that the good doctor has talked about here.\\\\n    And those jobs did not come to our small town and stay. \\\\nThey were temporary guys that came in. And the green companies \\\\nthat come in have wonderful subsidies and grants and things \\\\nthat the federal government has done for them that do not get \\\\nreinvested into Main Street USA. Very different than the oil \\\\nand gas economy.\\\\n    So while they are getting helped, we are getting hindered.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you for that testimony.\\\\n    Mr. Farris, it is estimated that U.S. small businesses \\\\nspend over $60 billion per year on electricity. As electricity \\\\nrates increase for consumers across the U.S., we must \\\\nprioritize the importance of affordable and reliable \\\\nelectricity access for small businesses.\\\\n    So my question to you is, can you please speak to the \\\\ncumulative impact of EPA&#x27;s regulations targeting the energy \\\\nsector on the electric bills of small businesses?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and absolutely. With \\\\nthe EPA&#x27;s new power plants proposal, they are targeting 60-plus \\\\npercent of our power generation, and that is natural gas and \\\\nthat is coal. And they have to, within 10 years, have \\\\nwidespread deployment of carbon capture and hydrogen. Both of \\\\nthose are wonderful technologies, but they are not available at \\\\nthe scale needed for this. And what will happen in those 10 \\\\nyears is that 60 percent of our power generation will shut \\\\ndown. And so bills will go up trying to meet these, but also we \\\\nwill have widespread power outages in the U.S. because of that \\\\npower generation shutting down. So it can have a catastrophic \\\\neffect on small businesses, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you. Dr. Aklog, I got about a \\\\nminute left to go here and I want to talk about ethylene. Is \\\\nthat how you say it? Say it again. Ethylene oxide, right? \\\\nExplain to the Committee what banning the use of ethylene oxide \\\\nwould mean for human health.\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. Well, it starts from the fact that there are 20 \\\\nbillion medical devices sterilized by it with ethylene oxide in \\\\nthis country a year, and that represents about one in two \\\\nmedical devices. Ethylene oxide sterilized devices are \\\\neverywhere in healthcare. You step into a hospital, every \\\\ncorner has IV, syringes, you know, very simple technologies, as \\\\nwell as the most complex technologies, such as the heart valve \\\\nthat I described.\\\\n    So a decline, a meaningful decline in capacity for \\\\nsterilization with ethylene oxide will lead to supply chain \\\\nissues and patient access to lifesaving medical technologies. \\\\nAnd in some cases, where they are urgent, where these \\\\nprocedures are urgent, it could lead to severe patient \\\\nsuffering and death.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay, thank you. My time is up.\\\\n    I now recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes of \\\\nquestions.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Green, Americans want a livable planet, but some in \\\\nCongress believe there is a trade-off, either the environment \\\\nor the economy. Is this true?\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. This shouldn&#x27;t be true, but that is their sense.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. How are new, innovative technologies \\\\nemerging from environmental regulations leading to new business \\\\nstarts?\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Yeah. So I have had the opportunity to spend \\\\nsome time at an innovation space called Greentown Labs, which \\\\nthey have an operation in Houston as well as an operation in \\\\nBoston, Massachusetts. They are growing, incubating, and \\\\nsupporting small businesses that are revolutionizing clean \\\\ntechnology. And guess who is one of the largest supporters in \\\\nembracing of these new technologies, is the oil and gas \\\\nindustry. They look at this as an opportunity to change their \\\\nbusiness models and start to innovate and clean up in ways that \\\\nare being less maybe facing the regulation and more towards the \\\\nopportunity of growth and looking forward to a new American \\\\neconomy.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Green, the regulations written by the \\\\nEPA clean our nation&#x27;s air, land, and waters. In your \\\\ntestimony, you mentioned that they can also level the playing \\\\nfield for small businesses. Can you please expound on this \\\\naspect of your testimony?\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Small businesses and main street businesses that \\\\nwe work with don&#x27;t have the opportunity to use our air and \\\\nwater as a dumping ground. And they often are at the feeling \\\\nthe impacts of such decisions that are made by large \\\\ncorporations. So when leveling the playing ground, all it is \\\\ndoing is it is holding the corporations to the same thing that \\\\na small business would probably decide in the first place of \\\\nsupporting public health in their local environment.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. Dr. Aklog, the proposed rule \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t ban EO, does it?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. I don&#x27;t believe so. But as I mentioned, I am----\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Correct. I support strong rules to protect \\\\npublic health. I understand your concerns with the proposed \\\\nrule, and I really appreciate your testimony here today. I \\\\nwould like to know, has the EPA worked with federal agencies \\\\nand the private sector to hear your concerns?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. Yes. So, I serve on the board of AdvaMed. I am \\\\nthe incoming Chair of the Excel division, which focuses on \\\\nsmall companies. And I have been invited to participate in \\\\ndiscussions with the EPA, with the administrator, with the \\\\ndeputy administrator, mostly for my perspective, not on the \\\\npolicy side, but on the healthcare side. And so those \\\\nconversations have occurred. I know FDA has weighed in. I \\\\nbelieve the SBA has also weighed in. So those conversations are \\\\nhappening.\\\\n    And I think the important point is that industry supports \\\\nupdated regulations. It is just the specific aspects of these \\\\nrules are not surgical. They have the potential to have an \\\\nimpact. And I believe there are sensible modifications that can \\\\nachieve those goals without having that adverse patient impact.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. Mr. Farris, you cite a 2023 Crane \\\\n&amp; Crane report. I haven&#x27;t read the report, but I do know that \\\\nin 2010, a study that was produced by Crane &amp; Crane was \\\\ncriticized by CRS and the Government Accountability Office, two \\\\nindependent offices that work with Congress, as well as the \\\\nEconomic Policy Institute for using unreliable methodology and \\\\nflood data. Were you aware of that?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. We are aware that anytime there is an academic \\\\nstudy, there will be questions about the validity of the data. \\\\nWe stand behind the Crane study and believe that is a valid \\\\nsnapshot of the cost of regulation.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. So do you believe that the Congressional \\\\nResearch Office and the Government Accountability Office were \\\\nwrong in their assessment of the Crane &amp; Crane report?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. Yes, ma&#x27;am. We stand behind the Crane data.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Okay. Well, I questioned the data based on \\\\nthe study and the opinion issued by our government agencies.\\\\n    Mr. Green, Democrats delivered on two new laws: the \\\\nBipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction \\\\nAct. How are the regulations to carry out these laws helping \\\\nsmall businesses to grow and flourish?\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Thank you so much for the question. You know, in \\\\nsmall mountain communities and communities that are feeling the \\\\nimpacts of climate change such as ours, we are looking for \\\\nfolks down here in D.C. to pull every single lever you possibly \\\\ncan to help us get on the right trajectory. So these \\\\nregulations work hand-in-hand with the innovation and the grant \\\\nprograms that are coming out of the EPA, as well, to help \\\\nbusinesses reach to compliance, as well as to reach the \\\\ninnovation goals that we all have for a healthy environment.\\\\n    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Thank \\\\nyou.\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Meuser from the great state \\\\nof Pennsylvania for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank \\\\nyou very much to our witnesses. Really appreciate it. It is \\\\nvery interesting and highly informative.\\\\n    So, as I think most of us know, inflation over the last 3 \\\\nyears is up over or nearly 18 percent, 17.9 percent. We get CBO \\\\nrecords that show regulations on businesses in general are up \\\\nsince the Biden administration has taken--went into effect, \\\\nover $400 billion. Clearly, that adds to inflation.\\\\n    Regulations do serve, clearly, a cost on your business, Ms. \\\\nWagner, as you were pointing out. We also have a letter from \\\\nthe Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy stating \\\\nhow on this proposal, Clear Power Plan 2.0, that the EPA has \\\\nsignificantly underestimated the cost that its proposed rules \\\\nwould impose on small entities.\\\\n    I am interested in hearing, Mr. Green brought up that or \\\\nthe question was do we have to forsake the environment for land \\\\ndevelopment, for manufacturing development, for the development \\\\nof medical devices that are life-saving?\\\\n    I would like, Mr. Farris, I am going to start with you, A, \\\\ntell me what you think about that comment as well. You have how \\\\nmany manufacturers that you represent?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. Nearly 14,000.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Fourteen thousand. And how many of them are \\\\nsmall business?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. The vast majority.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Okay, the vast majority. Number one, do you \\\\nthink they would agree with that comment? And number two, has \\\\nthe EPA come and spoken to you and asked how would this rule \\\\naffect those vast majority of 14,000 small businesses that \\\\ncreate the jobs that pay for the Little Leagues, that take care \\\\nof--truly are the ones invested in taking care of their \\\\ncommunities&#x27; environment?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. Thank you, Congressman. And what I can say is \\\\nthere doesn&#x27;t have to be a trade-off. Industry has worked, and \\\\nwe have some of the cleanest air in the world. We have \\\\ninnovated, and those technologies have led to having some of \\\\nthe cleanest air in the world.\\\\n    One of the great problems that we are seeing right now with \\\\nthese regulations is that they are so close to zero that they \\\\nare unachievable. So, yes, there does not have to be a trade-\\\\noff. We can have clean air and we can have a wonderful economy, \\\\nbut we cannot have it with these regulations that we are seeing \\\\nright now.\\\\n    And then to your point about is EPA hearing? Is EPA \\\\nlistening? I differentiate hearing and listening. Yes, there \\\\nare hearing sessions where they hear concerns, but are they \\\\nlistening? What we have seen on PFAS, what we have seen on \\\\nethylene oxide, is that other agencies are weighing in with EPA \\\\nand saying, if you create a de facto ban on PFAS, we can&#x27;t make \\\\nsemiconductors in the U.S., and the EPA isn&#x27;t listening.\\\\n    We have heard the same thing on ethylene oxide. If you \\\\ncreate a de facto ban on ethylene oxide, we will no longer be \\\\nable to sterilize most medical equipment. And EPA isn&#x27;t \\\\nlistening, sir.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you. Ms. Wagner, I am going to ask you a \\\\nquestion. So of all the regulations that you deal with, would \\\\nyou say half have the type of effect that was intended on the \\\\nenvironment and the other half are unnecessary costs? I don&#x27;t \\\\nwant to put words in your mouth. You tell me what you think the \\\\noutcomes are of those regulations that obviously add a lot to \\\\nyour cost of doing business.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Absolutely.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Which ones are worth it and which ones aren&#x27;t.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. In Texas, the regulations that we are \\\\nfunctioning under now that, like I said, my family business has \\\\nbeen under and in good standing with the Texas Railroad \\\\nCommission for 40 years, those regulations are prudent and just \\\\nand necessary. They are based on science, fact, common sense. \\\\nThere is a lot of boots on the ground work to understand how \\\\nthese things work in the real world.\\\\n    There is understanding of the difference in a marginal well \\\\nthat a producer like myself with a couple of hundred wells \\\\nacross the state of Texas versus the super majors and millions \\\\nof barrels a day that they are moving. The economies of scale \\\\nare taken into consideration, the volumes, the pressures. There \\\\nis a lot of science to that.\\\\n    So the regulations we have, like I said in my testimony, I \\\\nthink both written and oral, I am a proud member, as many \\\\noperators are, of a highly regulated industry. We have a duty \\\\nto protect and steward the natural resources, not only the ones \\\\nthat we produce, but the ones that we protect. The problem with \\\\nthe regulations that are ambiguously being proposed right now, \\\\nthe ambiguity, pardon me, is a huge part of the problem.\\\\n    And the rest of that is we are doing it. We are stewards. \\\\nWe are doing it now. So now it is just duplicitous and punitive \\\\nand it is not going to help the environment.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you very, very much.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Sure thing.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. Question to you, Doctor. Do you think there is \\\\na more realistic and effective way in which the EPA could \\\\nimplement this rule that would not be detrimental, that could \\\\nactually be positive to you?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. My understanding is there are engagements and \\\\nthere are alternatives really focused around the time to \\\\nimplementation and the flexibilities that we have.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I apologize, sir.\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. MEUSER. I didn&#x27;t leave you enough time to respond.\\\\n    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Ms. Scholten from the great state of \\\\nMichigan for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Fantastic. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair, and \\\\nthank you to our witnesses. I am up a little earlier in my \\\\norder than I thought I would be, so I am going to jump right in \\\\nhere.\\\\n    This is the third regulatory oversight hearing that we have \\\\nhad, and I really look forward to hearing how smart, well-\\\\ncrafted regulations help level the playing field for small \\\\nbusinesses throughout America. To that end, it is important to \\\\nrecognize when it comes to the EPA that the Agency is carrying \\\\nout the laws passed by Congress using science and leveraging \\\\nthe latest technologies available.\\\\n    My first question is for you, Mr. Green. Cutting through \\\\nthe rhetoric that compliance with commonsense environmental \\\\nprotections stifles opportunities for small businesses to grow \\\\nand operate, to what end is the impact of these regulations \\\\nmeasurable economically? Can we safely say that the benefits \\\\noutweigh the costs of the regulations or vice versa?\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. We absolutely can. It is 30-to-1, $30 to gained \\\\nto our economy for $1 spent in the regulation.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Fantastic. I am not going to argue with you \\\\nthere.\\\\n    As the effects of climate change hit more and more \\\\ndoorsteps across the country, it is clear that Main Street \\\\nAmerica has to adapt. That being said, it is not easy to say \\\\nwhat we can reasonably expect small businesses to do on their \\\\nown while remaining solvent and, in some cases, quite literally \\\\nabove water. We also know not all small businesses are created \\\\nthe same, right, ranging in scale from a couple dozen to a \\\\ncouple hundred.\\\\n    This question, again, is for Mr. Green. In your testimony, \\\\nyou highlight ways environmental regulations help to level the \\\\nplaying field for small businesses. Can you also speak to their \\\\nimpact on markets and any new and innovative strategies that \\\\nthey may produce?\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Yeah. No, they absolutely create the opportunity \\\\nto move markets and create new products for consumers that I \\\\nthink there is a strong demand. As an electric vehicle driver \\\\nin a rural community, my family has taken advantage of such \\\\namazing programs. And I was really pleased when I took the \\\\nopportunity to look up Roger Williams Chrysler, Jeep, and \\\\nDodge, and at the very first top of the menu was how to \\\\npurchase an electric vehicle.\\\\n    And so we are already seeing a lot of consumer interest and \\\\nconsumer demand pushing towards these new innovative \\\\ntechnologies. And industries, even as old as the auto industry, \\\\nare really getting to harness that opportunity.\\\\n    Ms. SCHOLTEN. Well, I thank you so much for your testimony \\\\nand for all the witnesses being here today.\\\\n    I yield back the remainder of my time.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The lady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Ellzey from the great state \\\\nof Texas for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. ELLZEY. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    On behalf of Mr. Meuser, I would like to ask unanimous \\\\nconsent to enter a joint trade letter into the Record from \\\\nNational Mining Association, American Exploration and Mining \\\\nAssociation, the Essential Minerals Association discussing the \\\\nchallenges small businesses face due to the U.S. Environmental \\\\nProtection Agency&#x27;s burdensome regulations.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. So moved.\\\\n    Mr. ELLZEY. Costs have been going up in our country for a \\\\nlong, long time. Under the Biden administration, the cost of \\\\nliving in the United States is about 20 percent, has gone up \\\\nabout 20 percent. Makes it very difficult for people to afford \\\\nbasic necessities.\\\\n    The Environmental Protection Agency is a part of that \\\\nproblem. They are one of the most oppressive rulemaking \\\\nagencies, and they are responsible for approximately $70.6 \\\\nbillion in new regulatory costs in 2023. That is not borne by \\\\nthe companies. It is borne by the consumers in passalongs. You \\\\ncan&#x27;t afford a truck, you can&#x27;t afford your rent, you can&#x27;t \\\\nafford to pay your taxes, you can&#x27;t afford to go to the grocery \\\\nstore.\\\\n    An additional 5.5 million paperwork hours for companies. \\\\nThese regulations have increased the cost and regulatory burden \\\\nfor nearly every job creator in America. What the \\\\nadministration fails to understand, these regulations have real \\\\nworld consequences for the American public overall, and \\\\nspecifically small businesses.\\\\n    We have the cleanest environment, water and air, of any \\\\nindustrialized nation on the planet. And the only thing the EPA \\\\nknows to do is serve as a self-licking ice cream cone to \\\\nprovide for its own existence and create new difficulties for \\\\nAmerican businesses to succeed. And those businesses hire \\\\npeople who live in this country.\\\\n    Now, in our appropriations bill in the Interior, we have \\\\ncut back on the EPA by 40 percent. Forty percent. And that is \\\\njust a start. But we have to get that appropriations bill \\\\nthrough the Senate and signed by the President so we can stop \\\\nallowing the EPA to have total control when they so choose over \\\\nthe business community in the United States of America.\\\\n    I have a lot of questions to ask three of you, and I wish I \\\\nhad time to get to them. But I did some digging about our folks \\\\non the end there. The American Sustainable Business Network is \\\\na merger between 2021 American Sustainable Business Council and \\\\nthe Social Venture Circle. And then I did some more digging on \\\\nwhat this group actually does. It is a member of the \\\\nDeclaration for American Democracy Coalition, a left-leaning \\\\nactivist coalition that advocates electoral administration \\\\npolicy changes.\\\\n    And then I read a little bit further that they are a \\\\nproject of the Public Citizen Foundation founded by Ralph \\\\nNader. And then I did a little bit further digging. The \\\\nfoundation, located in Washington, D.C., provides \\\\nadministrative and financial support to Public Citizen, in \\\\naddition to running its own research and media programs with a \\\\nfocus on health, environmentalism, and limiting business \\\\nrights.\\\\n    Make no mistake about what is going on with the EPA and \\\\ngroups like our group on the end. This isn&#x27;t about American \\\\nbusinesses and making them stronger. This is about shutting \\\\ndown American businesses and outsourcing our guilt, like we \\\\nhave done with the mining of our rare earth metals, which we \\\\nneed for our national security and the very lives we lead every \\\\nday for microchip production, for energy independence. So we \\\\nare going to limit LNG production in the United States so that \\\\nGermany is more dependent on our enemy, Russia, for their \\\\nnatural gas.\\\\n    This is harmful to national security. It is harmful for the \\\\nsecurity of our families. It is making life more difficult for \\\\nthem.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what you have done in these \\\\nhearings on promoting American businesses, holding the Small \\\\nBusiness Administration accountable, trying to improve their \\\\nability to help small businesses. But when somebody says they \\\\nare trying to help the 33 million small businesses in this \\\\ncountry by making it harder for them to do their jobs, and the \\\\nrestrictions on a five-barrel-a-day production, well, limiting \\\\nthe ability for our medical community to clean the things that \\\\nwe use to take care of our American people, they are making it \\\\ndifficult to live in the United States.\\\\n    And I think it is about time to go back to the \\\\nAdministrative Procedures Act and do away with the EPA, because \\\\nwe already have a redundancy in every state. Every state has \\\\ntheir own EPA. In Texas, it&#x27;s the TCEQ. And those TCEQ members \\\\ndo a very good job of making sure that the air and the water in \\\\nthe state of Texas is clean. We don&#x27;t need the EPA&#x27;s help.\\\\n    I am about out of time. Sorry I didn&#x27;t get to ask any \\\\nquestions, but it needs to be clear on what the agenda is of \\\\nsome folks in this country when they claim it is about \\\\nsupporting American businesses.\\\\n    With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Ms. Maloy from the great state of Utah for \\\\nher 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had a bunch of \\\\nthoughts I was prepared to share about federalism and how \\\\nredundant and unnecessary some of these EPA regulations are, \\\\nbut Mr. Ellzey just did a fantastic job of that, so I am going \\\\nto move on. In fact, I wish I had said what he just said.\\\\n    Ms. Wagner, first of all, thank you for your testimony. You \\\\nare a fantastic witness. And I have a high school graduating \\\\nclass of 32. I rarely meet people who can beat me on that, \\\\nbesides my siblings, so great to hear about that.\\\\n    And what you said really had a ring of truth to me. I grew \\\\nup in a small town in a rural area where people are dependent \\\\non resources to make a living, and we have a built-n incentive. \\\\nWe learn from the time we are tiny that we have a \\\\nresponsibility to take care of the resources God gave us on \\\\nthis Earth. So thank you for sharing that.\\\\n    And to that point, reading through the materials for this \\\\nhearing, I am reading that small business optimism is very low. \\\\nOne reason is the burdensome regulations that are coming from \\\\nunaccountable federal agencies that can&#x27;t be voted out of \\\\noffice, that don&#x27;t have to go back and face the voters every 2 \\\\nyears like we do.\\\\n    And the EPA isn&#x27;t just regulating pollution and protecting \\\\nhuman health anymore. They are trying to change the way we do \\\\nbusiness in this country, which is outside of their scope. They \\\\nare part of the executive branch. We, as the legislative \\\\nbranch, have the responsibility to act as a check on them. And \\\\nthat is why you are here. That is what we are doing here today.\\\\n    Overregulation kills main street under the weight of \\\\ncompliance and also the cost of inadvertent noncompliance, when \\\\nrules get so burdensome that people don&#x27;t even know whether \\\\nthey are in compliance or not. So I am getting to questions \\\\nhere.\\\\n    Our friend Mr. Green on the end just said that he sees a \\\\n30-to-1 return on regulation. For every dollar they spend, they \\\\nget a $30 bump. And I want to go down the line with the other \\\\nthree of you and ask you individually, Mr. Farris, you \\\\nrepresent a lot of small businesses. Do you find that to be \\\\naccurate?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. I would say that I would love to see those \\\\nstudies. All of our studies do not show that.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. So your Members don&#x27;t feel like regulation from \\\\nthe EPA helps their bottom line?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. Not from what we are seeing right now. We can \\\\nwork together on regulations. Regulations can be helpful, but \\\\nwhat we are seeing right now is they are not helpful, and they \\\\nare all set at zero to where, to your point, it is shutting \\\\ndown businesses.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Thank you. Ms. Wagner?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. I would say the inverse of the other witnesses, \\\\nduplicitous regulations cost money. They will never produce \\\\nmore oil and gas or any cost savings for my business, which \\\\nwill hurt my employees and the communities that we support.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Thank you. That also has the ring of truth to \\\\nme. Mr. Aklog?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. So, I work in an industry that is primarily \\\\nregulated by the FDA. And obviously, we all would accept that \\\\nhealthcare technologies needs to be regulated. And so the issue \\\\nis really about smart regulations and coordination between the \\\\nregulatory agencies to make sure that we don&#x27;t end up with \\\\nadverse consequences to patients. And that is what we are \\\\ntrying to accommodate here.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. And do you think that further regulations give \\\\nyou a 30-to-1 increase in your profit margin?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. I am not focused on our profit margin. I am \\\\nfocused on patients and patient outcomes. And that, to me, is \\\\nthe overriding question here, is that we have to have \\\\nregulations that protect patients, but don&#x27;t do the opposite, \\\\nwhich is what we are facing here.\\\\n    Ms. MALOY. Thank you. And during your testimony, it struck \\\\nme that, you know, the justification for these environmental \\\\nregulations is that we are trying to keep our air and water \\\\nclean, protect human life. But in the case of removing \\\\nsomething we need to sterilize medical devices, it is having \\\\nthe opposite impact. We could be taking human lives in the \\\\neffort to protect human lives. You don&#x27;t have to respond to \\\\nthat. Just an observation.\\\\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Alford from the great state \\\\nof Missouri for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Thank you, Chair. And I apologize for not being \\\\nhere sooner. We have a lot of competition on the Hill today. \\\\nJust met King Abdullah from Jordan and Secretary Vilsack in \\\\nanother hearing. But this is so important, and I wanted to be \\\\nhere for your testimony.\\\\n    I have read it. I appreciate you coming here on your own \\\\ntime and your own dime, as I like to say, because I know that \\\\nis part of being American is coming before Committees like \\\\nthis. We are concentrated on making America great again through \\\\nmaking main street great again. And I thank the Chairman and \\\\nthe Ranking Member for holding this.\\\\n    The EPA, of course, you know, was created by President \\\\nNixon to monitor and enforce our national guidelines on the \\\\nenvironment. However, under President Biden the EPA has \\\\ncompletely abandoned this mandate. Instead, taking their cues \\\\nfrom radical environmentalists, they are attempting to regulate \\\\nentire industries out of existence.\\\\n    In 2023 alone, the EPA was responsible for approximately \\\\n$70.6 billion in regulatory cost and an additional 5.5 million \\\\npaperwork hours for companies. The Biden EPA might be happy to \\\\nlearn that America is actually reducing the amount of \\\\ngreenhouse gas emissions and has been since 2007.\\\\n    As the United States has drastically decreased our \\\\nemissions, communist China emissions have spiked. China&#x27;s \\\\nemissions have approximately doubled since &#x27;06, when they \\\\nbecame the world&#x27;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. While \\\\nAmerican emissions have been constantly decreasing, the Chinese \\\\ncontinue to increase their pollution.\\\\n    While the radical environmentalists would love to claim \\\\nthat America&#x27;s progress is due to their activism, the data \\\\nclearly shows that this happened despite their best efforts. \\\\nThe reason American emissions peaked in &#x27;07 is because of \\\\nhardworking independent energy producers, like Cooper Oil and \\\\nGas.\\\\n    America reduced emissions and gained energy independence \\\\nbecause of the shale revolution and the policies of the Trump \\\\nadministration. This has led to cheap and plentiful energy, \\\\nincluding a doubling of the natural gas produced since 2006. \\\\nAmerica reduced emissions and gained energy independence \\\\nbecause of our small energy producers, not because of the \\\\nroadblocks thrown in their way by radical environmentalists. As \\\\nMs. Cooper Wagner will surely attest, the shale revolution has \\\\nbeen the greatest environmental boon the world has ever seen.\\\\n    Now to our questions. For Ms. Cooper Wagner, American \\\\ncarbon emissions have declined year on year since &#x27;07, as I \\\\nmentioned. Much of the progress has been due to increased usage \\\\nof natural gas from small-scale producers like your own. Why do \\\\nyou think the Biden administration is proposing rules and \\\\nregulations that would crush small energy producers like yours \\\\nif you are part of the solution?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. That is a fabulous question and I appreciate \\\\nyour comments. And will even say something I don&#x27;t get to to \\\\nmost people, you are welcome.\\\\n    Our industry is fiercely private. We are a small mom-and-\\\\npop. Again, I work with my dad and mom, with my husband and my \\\\nbrother. We never knew that we needed to be so public and \\\\neducate regulators, legislators, and the general public about \\\\nwhat we do and the quality and quantity of life that we \\\\nprovide. I don&#x27;t know if it is just a lack of education and how \\\\nthings work, why the lights are on, why your cars are safe, why \\\\nwhen there is disaster, you are safe from it. And the majority \\\\nof those reasons are because of fossil fuels.\\\\n    You know, I am not sure why there is a target on my back. \\\\nAnd as a mother of two young kids, I never try to be a doomsday \\\\nsayer and everything is bad and, you know, the big guys are \\\\nafter us. I don&#x27;t like to live in that world. I believe there \\\\nis good in all people and good in this world. But it is a \\\\ndifficult line to walk as an E&amp;P producer and someone in the \\\\noil and gas industry, and I am not quite sure they want to wipe \\\\nus out, but it definitely feels that way.\\\\n    Those returns that you are talking about and leveling \\\\nplaying fields between super majors and us don&#x27;t exist. I will \\\\nnever compete with them. The economies of scale, we are in \\\\ndifferent markets, different everything. They can absorb \\\\nerroneous regulations from the EPA for no real environmental \\\\nbenefit and push that cost to the end consumer. I can&#x27;t do \\\\nthat. I am the end. The buck stops with me and my small company \\\\nand my small business and our small community.\\\\n    Mr. ALFORD. Well, thank you so much. And, you know, they \\\\nlike to say that ignorance is bliss. In this case, ignorance is \\\\ndangerous. It is dangerous to your company, your business, and \\\\nto the American people.\\\\n    This administration has put the crosshairs on the backs of \\\\nthe American people by demonizing fossil fuels with \\\\noverregulation. We have got to regain our territory. We must be \\\\nenergy independent once again.\\\\n    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Van Duyne from the great \\\\nstate of Texas for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    The subject at today&#x27;s hearing is one of tremendous \\\\nimportance and one we hear about again and again from small \\\\nbusinesses. The EPA is determined to overstep its authority and \\\\nget in the way of Americans and job creators. Small businesses \\\\nare already having to suffer 3 years of disastrous policies \\\\nunder the Biden administration that have driven up the cost of \\\\nliving, making food, electricity, housing, and transportation \\\\nnearly impossible to afford.\\\\n    Last June, I, along with the Chairman and several other \\\\nMembers of this Committee, sent a letter to the EPA \\\\nAdministrator on their proposed rule to ban the use of PCE, \\\\nwhich is used in dry cleaners as a cleaning solvent, and, if \\\\nbanned, would force thousands of small businesses to close \\\\ntheir door. The EPA estimates that their rule could cost \\\\nbusinesses anywhere, and this is great, this is just phenomenal \\\\nwork from the EPA, they are estimating that it could cost \\\\nbusinesses anywhere from $850 to $10.4 million. That is a huge \\\\nmargin. And I want to know, I mean, how do you plan as a small \\\\nbusiness for that type of a margin?\\\\n    Last year, this Committee passed my bill, the Small \\\\nBusiness Regulatory Reduction Act, which requires the Small \\\\nBusiness Administration to ensure for each fiscal year that the \\\\ncost to small businesses of the administration&#x27;s rulemaking is \\\\nnot greater than zero, while also requiring the SBA to issue a \\\\nreport on any regulations issued by other federal agencies that \\\\nimpact small businesses. And I am looking forward to expanding \\\\nthese provisions beyond just the SBA and into EPA. And I think \\\\nEPA is a perfect place to start when you consider what is \\\\nhappening in our energy industry and its huge impacts on our \\\\neconomy.\\\\n    Ms. Wagner, thank you for being here today. I know it is a \\\\nlittle chillier here than at home in Fort Worth. I appreciate \\\\nyour testimony. I appreciate your responses just now to Mark \\\\nAlford&#x27;s questions. His questions were very similar to mine. \\\\nThis is what happens when you are one of the last speakers, \\\\nright? All the questions have already been asked. But I know \\\\nthat you have invested a lot in what is going on in the \\\\nenvironment. It is not in your best interest, you know, for the \\\\nenvironment to not be taken seriously and to be unsafe.\\\\n    Can you talk a little bit about those investments? And can \\\\nyou talk about the overregulations, the regulatory burdens that \\\\nyour small business, that Cooper Energy is having to face, and \\\\npossible solutions or what specifically you think could help \\\\nget rid of some of those regulations? If you have got any \\\\nideas, I would love to be able to hear them.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Sure. Thank you. Thank you for the questions \\\\nand for the time. It is an honor to be here today.\\\\n    The regulations that we have in place in our small company, \\\\nwe employ a full-time person to just manage the regulations \\\\nthat we have now. So just in our little company, it is a full-\\\\ntime job in the office for staff, just on the paperwork side of \\\\nthings. For my guys in the field, it is part of their job every \\\\nday to make sure that these regulations are followed.\\\\n    More regulations for me are going to mean I am going to \\\\nhave to hire more people with, again, no benefit from those \\\\nregulations to be able to pay those people, to be able to give \\\\nthem those good-paying jobs in a rural area that are so hard to \\\\ncome by.\\\\n    Again, regulations and being a part of a regulated \\\\nindustry, like you have heard from the three of us, is \\\\nimportant, and we are a proud member of that. If EPA, if other \\\\nregulatory agencies could listen to some of the comments that \\\\nwe have submitted, the input that we have tried to have, that \\\\nseems to go--I echo your comments on the difference between \\\\nlistening and hearing. We need to be able to partner to be able \\\\nto make good, responsible decisions that aren&#x27;t going to wipe \\\\nout small businesses.\\\\n    We are a scrappy bunch. We make money on stuff that all the \\\\nmajors have walked away from. We make money where you shouldn&#x27;t \\\\nbe able to. But there is a whole economy of that that supports \\\\nmillions of vital rural economy Americans--American economies, \\\\nrather, and these regulations will effectively wipe that out. \\\\nThere are businesses that will not survive and jobs that will \\\\nnot survive.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. I appreciate your testimony and your answer.\\\\n    Dr. Aklog, I have heard from doctors in my district about \\\\nthe concerns they have if the EPA moves forward with their \\\\nproposed rule banning ETO, which is used as a sterilization \\\\nagent for medical equipment. What type of alternatives exist if \\\\nthe rule is finalized? And how realistic are they for small \\\\nbusinesses?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. Thank you. There are a couple of other \\\\ntraditional alternatives, such as steam heating and radiation \\\\nthat have been used to sterilize medical devices, but they are \\\\njust not appropriate or they don&#x27;t work in the vast majority. \\\\nSo about 50 percent of medical devices, the only currently \\\\navailable technology is ethylene oxide. There is active R&amp;D, \\\\nand we are in the innovation business, so we certainly welcome \\\\nnew types of sterilization. The problem is that none of them \\\\nare yet ready for prime time.\\\\n    There is one example called vaporized hydrogen peroxide, \\\\nwhich is a gas like ethylene oxide, and in theory, could have \\\\nsome of the benefits of being able to sort of work your way \\\\nthrough the innermost parts of these complex devices. But it is \\\\nreally new, and we don&#x27;t have the data. The processes of \\\\ndetermining that they actually work is quite overburden.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you. My time has run out.\\\\n    I yield back, but thank you for your answer.\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman WILLIAMS. The gentlelady yields back.\\\\n    I now recognize Representative Hunt from the great state of \\\\nTexas for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. HUNT. Thank you, Chairman Williams, and thank you, \\\\nRanking Member. I want to thank our witnesses for joining us \\\\nhere today.\\\\n    I want to look at some of the burdensome regulations that \\\\nhave been implemented by the EPA and the Biden administration \\\\nas they continue to put more hurdles in front of businesses \\\\nlike yours, ma&#x27;am, and our hardest working citizens in our \\\\ncountry.\\\\n    Ms. Wagner, I want to thank you so much, ma&#x27;am, for what \\\\nyou have done. I want to thank you for your company. I want to \\\\nthank you for helping the smaller pieces of the oil and gas \\\\nindustry in a rural part of our state where it is not the \\\\neasiest to create and thrive. Really appreciate you, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    And thank you for working to keep our houses cool in the \\\\nsummer and heated in the winter. Without you, your dedicated \\\\nemployees, and other companies like yours, our quality of life \\\\nin this country would be way worse than it is right now, for \\\\nthe record.\\\\n    President Biden has been actively calling for the end of \\\\noil, of the oil and gas industry since the day and before the \\\\nday he took office. And he put the priorities of the radical \\\\nleft&#x27;s climate change agenda over the needs of the American \\\\npeople and commonsense policies.\\\\n    The administration is more than willing to use fossil fuels \\\\nto prop up their failing ESG initiatives, just as long as those \\\\nfossil fuels don&#x27;t come from America or American companies. We \\\\ncontinue to see the Biden administration purchasing oil from \\\\nVenezuela and critical minerals from child labor mines in \\\\nAfrica and allowing China to continue to build their multiple \\\\ncoal-powered plants each month while ignoring their climate \\\\nfootprint as they continue to increase their climate footprint \\\\nfrom time to time, from generation to generation, although we \\\\ncontinue to decrease our carbon footprint.\\\\n    All foreign countries where they have less regulation, less \\\\noversight, and exponentially dirtier oil, we continue to see \\\\nJoe Biden and the climate cartel approving pipelines in Europe \\\\nthat allow natural gas to flow freely into homes of European \\\\nfamilies while killing the very same projects domestically.\\\\n    Our American energy companies are world leaders in \\\\ninnovation, productivity and accountability. I cannot think of \\\\na single energy company that does not obsess over their \\\\ncompliance, field equipment maintenance, and take general \\\\npreventative measures on their own outside of whatever \\\\nregulations that are already in place to ensure that we \\\\ncontinue to operate at 100 percent capacity.\\\\n    Ma&#x27;am, Ms. Wagner, this question is for you. What is your \\\\nestimated compliance cost over the next 5 years for the methane \\\\nrule and with other EPA regulations, and how does it impact \\\\nyour bottom line?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Thank you. I appreciate your comments very \\\\nmuch.\\\\n    Mr. HUNT. Appreciate you.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Thank you. The cost estimate currently, this is \\\\nalso very ambiguous, and I hate to sit here and say I don&#x27;t \\\\nknow, but it is not clear. So many things are not finalized. So \\\\nmany things are being restructured. There is a tax that we are \\\\nsubject to that goes into effect before the formulaic work and \\\\nthe empirical evidence has been shown to know if I am subject \\\\nto that tax.\\\\n    I pay taxes. I don&#x27;t do tax law myself.\\\\n    Mr. HUNT. I pay a lot of taxes.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Yeah. A whole bunch of taxes, yes, sir. I know \\\\nthat there are companies that have already been so concerned \\\\nand so, quite honestly, scared so many small businesses that \\\\nare living in fear that they have hired some environmental \\\\ncompanies to do this just to find out if they might qualify. \\\\nBecause the environmental companies can&#x27;t tell you for sure yes \\\\nor no has cost small operators like myself approximately \\\\n$10,000. And the answer is, thank you for the $10,000. Here is \\\\nall the work we have done based on what EPA has put out. I \\\\ndon&#x27;t know if you qualify or not. And if so, if you do, it will \\\\nbe up to a range, like the Congresswoman pointed out earlier, \\\\nit could be hundreds of dollars if you don&#x27;t qualify. It could \\\\nbe millions of dollars if you do.\\\\n    The problem is, if you do or don&#x27;t qualify under these \\\\nrules. what I am concerned about as a small operator is maybe I \\\\nam under a threshold. Maybe I don&#x27;t emit, maybe I don&#x27;t fit the \\\\nformulas. Proving the negative is going to be just as expensive \\\\nas if I did. And proving the negative means I am going to have \\\\nto do all of the same things that will not help my business. \\\\nThey will not make my business more money to be paying those \\\\ntaxes, paying those royalties, helping my communities. They are \\\\njust going to be a net cost that will wipe out businesses that \\\\nare the size of mine and smaller.\\\\n    Mr. HUNT. Would you consider it to be like a hidden tax.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. I would consider it to be erroneous and \\\\noverburdensome regulation.\\\\n    Mr. HUNT. Understood. Quick, simple question for you as \\\\nwell. Did you find it easier or more difficult to produce \\\\nenergy for the American people today when Donald Trump was \\\\npresident or when the current administration is now in office?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Our business practices basically sustain over \\\\n40 years, regardless of who is in office.\\\\n    Mr. HUNT. Understood.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. But I did not feel the target on my back that I \\\\ndo since President Biden has taken office.\\\\n    Mr. HUNT. Understood. I want to close with this, ladies and \\\\ngentlemen. As a candidate for President, Joe Biden again \\\\npromised to end the oil and gas industry. He said this with his \\\\nown words, but here is a dirty little secret. He only wants to \\\\nend it in America. Biden doesn&#x27;t have any problem buying dirty \\\\noil from Venezuela. He doesn&#x27;t have any problem buying oil from \\\\nour adversaries. And Joe Biden and his colleagues want the oil. \\\\nThey just don&#x27;t want to see how the sausage is made.\\\\n    The Biden administration&#x27;s energy policy is out of sight, \\\\nout of mind. And as long as it is not being produced in \\\\nAmerica, the climate lobby won&#x27;t be upset. We have got to fix \\\\nthis.\\\\n    And thank you so much. I yield back the rest of my time. \\\\nThank you for being here, ma&#x27;am.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. [Presiding.] I now recognize Rep. \\\\nGluesenkamp Perez from Washington for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you, Chairwoman. And thank you \\\\nto the witnesses for being here today.\\\\n    So before coming to Congress, I ran an auto repair in a \\\\nmachine shop with my husband. We are an independent. Not \\\\nespecially lucrative, right? And I will never forget going into \\\\nwrecking yards. I remember I was picking up parts for, like, a \\\\n&#x27;90s Toyota, and the guy was like, the owner, a buddy was like, \\\\ncrying. He had an inspector there, so, right, wrecking yards, \\\\ncheap land. It is not a high-margin business. You are operating \\\\noften in wetlands.\\\\n    So the environmental impact, you know, and businesses like \\\\nmine, I mean, we didn&#x27;t cause the oil leak. We are fixing the \\\\noil leak. We are stopping the oil from going into the river. \\\\nAnd we are the ones who are under scrutiny because we are the \\\\none fixing the problem. And, you know, in these wrecking yards \\\\nthat we see getting shut down all across the country, they are \\\\nthe independents, usually, and they don&#x27;t have the money for \\\\nthe lawyers to navigate the system.\\\\n    And, you know, you think about what is the average consumer \\\\ngoing to do when they can&#x27;t get their Toyota Corolla fixed? \\\\nInstead of remanufacturing a part that is always been in \\\\nAmerica, they are going to have to get some cheap thing from \\\\nChina that is going to fail. And you think about the downstream \\\\neffects on the economy of shutting down these small repair \\\\nshops and wrecking yards when they are not compliant with EPA \\\\nregulations. That hinders a really important part of the supply \\\\nchain.\\\\n    And so, you know, I guess my question is how--this is the \\\\ntension we see between the EPA&#x27;s mission, which I value. I like \\\\nknowing my water is clean. I like knowing my air is clean. But \\\\nI also want equity and who is being held accountable and who \\\\nhas the capacity to navigate these rules.\\\\n    And, Mr. Green, in your opinion, how do you balance the \\\\nneeds of the economy with that, like, lens of equity for the \\\\nsmaller companies that don&#x27;t have the infrastructure to \\\\nnavigate?\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. I think the lens of equity should really be \\\\nfocused on the communities that have been disproportionately \\\\nimpacted by the negative health impacts and the environmental \\\\nimpacts, because their communities have often been overlooked, \\\\novershadowed, and underrepresented when they are making \\\\ndecisions about where to put things that are going to create a \\\\nlot of pollution in their backyard.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. When you say ``they are making \\\\ndecisions,&#x27;&#x27; like, who are you referring to about making the \\\\ndecision to put their wrecking yard in the only place they can \\\\nafford to put it? Who is making that decision?\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. The business.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. The small business.\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. The business is making a decision.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. So then you want to hold the small \\\\nbusiness accountable for not having the resources to go to a \\\\nwealthier neighborhood.\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. I would want the small business to be \\\\naccountable for the footprint and their business decision and \\\\nthe impact that their business is having on their local \\\\ncommunity.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, I think that, \\\\nlike, my experience is that the smaller guys are the ones who \\\\nare accountable. We are the ones who are sponsoring the Little \\\\nLeague team and donating to teachers. We are part of the \\\\ncommunity. The small ones are the ones who are also the ones \\\\nwho can&#x27;t navigate these rules.\\\\n    When I bought my property, when I bought my auto shop, the \\\\nseller literally had a heart attack because that is his whole \\\\nnet worth. And if there was an environmental finding there, \\\\nlike, he is liable. He can&#x27;t afford to go to a nursing home \\\\nafter that, you know. I mean, how do we balance? I don&#x27;t know \\\\nif anybody here has insight, like, how do we balance in \\\\ncreating a system that the smaller guys can navigate, also?\\\\n    Because I think a lot of this is just contributing to \\\\nconsolidation is my concern. And then you really do have the \\\\nbig guys who don&#x27;t go to the bake sale, you know, who aren&#x27;t \\\\nselling Girl Scout cookies, you know.\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Right. Can I take----\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Yeah, please.\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Yeah. And so I think part of it is that we are \\\\nmoving the American public away from the understanding of the \\\\ntrue intent of the EPA by using, you know, like kind of these \\\\ntactics of talking about how scary these regulations, how it is \\\\ngoing to support, you know, countries over abroad that maybe, \\\\nyou know, it is being placed in a way where people are anti-EPA \\\\nrather than trying to engage within the EPA process. So if we \\\\nused a conversation or had a conversation about these rules are \\\\nsomething that we all agree on and want to see happen rather \\\\nthan fear tactics when we are talking about these things, \\\\nrather than scaring those small businesses away from the \\\\nconversation, we could bring them into the conversation.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Yeah. How would you recommend \\\\nbringing those small businesses in? And how would you \\\\nrecommend--or can you point to things that you would----\\\\n    Mr. GREEN. Yeah. So at the clean power plan ruling, there \\\\nwere in the Region 1 offices in Massachusetts, there was a \\\\noverflow. And we actually filled not only the hearing room, but \\\\nalso outside the hearing room with small businesses that were \\\\naround the Salem Harbor Power Plant, around the Brayton Point \\\\nPower Plant. So I would actually say that small businesses, \\\\nwhen there is the opportunity to engage, are engaging. Most of \\\\nus here today are claiming to or do support and represent the \\\\nsmall business community. So I think it is actually a words \\\\ndecision to bring those businesses in and the mechanisms \\\\nalready exist to continue to have them.\\\\n    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you all for being here today. \\\\nThank you, Mr. Green.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. Thank you. I now recognize Representative \\\\nStauber from Minnesota for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\\\n    To my colleague that just spoke, I couldn&#x27;t agree with you \\\\nmore. I appreciate your comments about the small operators, the \\\\nsmall folks.\\\\n    And Mr. Green, I couldn&#x27;t disagree with you more about the \\\\nEPA. Let me tell you something. The EPA has shut down mining, \\\\nmanufacturing, logging, and timber producing in our great \\\\nstate, so I disagree with you fundamentally on the EPA trying \\\\nto work with them. Okay. I have seen the devastation. I have \\\\nseen our farmers and ranchers. The WOTUS rule was devastating, \\\\ndevastating to small businesses. And so I think--I read your \\\\ncomments. I appreciate where you come from. But sir, I \\\\nadamantly disagree with you.\\\\n    The Biden administration is run by extreme radical \\\\nenvironmentalists who abuse the law and bend it to their will. \\\\nThe unelected bureaucrats at the EPA are by far the worst \\\\noffenders. EPA regulations constantly attack my constituents \\\\nand our way of life. They restrict our mining operations, our \\\\nlogging operations, and wildlife management. They force extreme \\\\nGreen New Deal policies on our businesses without care for the \\\\noverwhelming costs. And now they are going after our \\\\nhealthcare.\\\\n    The proposed rule on ETO sterilization, ethylene oxide \\\\nsterilization, that technology will eliminate a chemical used \\\\nto sterilize medical equipment. Eliminating ETO would require \\\\nmanufacturers to change how they sterilize medical equipment, \\\\neither adopting more costly or less effective solutions.\\\\n    Additionally, there are many instances where ETO simply \\\\ncannot be replaced by other sterilization methods. Tools such \\\\nas respirators, heart valves, pacemakers, and catheters can \\\\nonly be properly sterilized by ETO as other methods are \\\\nineffective or even harmful.\\\\n    Make no mistake, this rule will increase costs, reduce \\\\naccess, and eliminate services in our healthcare industry. And \\\\nrural America is always the first one negatively impacted. \\\\nRural America, rural healthcare, rural hospitals matter.\\\\n    Dr. Aklog, each year millions of separate medical \\\\ninstruments are needed for nearly 1 million breast biopsies, \\\\n300,000 hysterectomies, 500,000 open heart surgeries, and the \\\\n1.1 million C sections that are performed each year. Are the \\\\ninstruments for all these procedures just mentioned sterilized \\\\nby ETO? And what would be the impact if they were not available \\\\ndue to the lack of sterilization?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. They are. The answer is--the simple answer is \\\\nyes.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Microphone. Thank you.\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. Apologize.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. I am hard of hearing. I am an &#x27;80s metalhead. \\\\nGo ahead.\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. The answer is yes. So all of the examples that \\\\nyou gave, and I could list numerous more, those are kits, \\\\nsurgical kits that are packaged for use in surgery, and they \\\\nrequire a gas to penetrate the packaging in order to be able to \\\\noffer a sterile device. And so the answer is, they are--that is \\\\nthe only option for those. And not having that would have, \\\\nagain, a devastating impact on delays for surgery and \\\\npotentially death and harm.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. And, you know, you added ``potentially death \\\\nand harm.&#x27;&#x27; Here is the EPA making these decisions.\\\\n    Under EPA&#x27;s proposal, millions of products would require \\\\nrevalidation. What would this mean for capacity and supplies of \\\\nthe critical medical technology needed for patient care?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. In its current form, it would have a significant \\\\nimpact. So to revalidate, even if there was an alternative for \\\\nthose, to revalidate that technology, you have to go through a \\\\nvery rigorous FDA process, which we all understand it is part \\\\nof what we do every day. And that to revalidate a complex \\\\ntechnology can take many, many years. So the idea that you can \\\\nchannel into an alternative quickly without having an impact on \\\\npatient care, it is just not true.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. Do you think small businesses like yours feel \\\\nheard in the federal rulemaking process?\\\\n    Dr. AKLOG. I think, thanks to organizations like AdvaMed, \\\\nsmall businesses like myself do actually have a say. And I \\\\nwould say there is engagement, and that is why we are here. I \\\\nam here to hopefully continue that and send the message that \\\\nthere are alternatives that are less onerous, that, you know, \\\\nwhere the time to implementation and flexibility on standards \\\\ncan mitigate the risks that we see with the rule as it is \\\\ncurrently proposed.\\\\n    Mr. STAUBER. We must do more to increase the affordability \\\\nand accessibility of healthcare. And the EPA regulations just \\\\nput more people in harm&#x27;s way.\\\\n    As a reminder for this panel, $360 billion of additional \\\\nregulations put on our small businesses and farmers by this \\\\nadministration. And I will repeat that, 360 billion. That is \\\\nwith a B.\\\\n    Madam Chair, I yield back.\\\\n    Ms. VAN DUYNE. I now recognize Rep. Bean from Florida for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Good morning to \\\\nyou and good morning, Small Business Committee. Lady and \\\\ngentlemen of the witness panel, good morning. We are glad to \\\\nhave you here.\\\\n    Hats off to all small business owners. I have been a small \\\\nbusiness owner. You are often the first to show up for work, \\\\nthe last to leave. You are the last to get paid. And in a \\\\nperfect world, it is just hard to run a business. It is just \\\\nhard, let alone when the invisible hand of government comes and \\\\ntries to push you down and stifle you. That invisible hand is \\\\nnot invisible anymore. We see it, we feel it. And hats off to \\\\nyou.\\\\n    Has it ever been this bad? Anybody want to jump in? Has it \\\\never been this bad? Ms. Wagner, you want to jump in? What say \\\\nyou, has it been this bad before?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. I have the history. I am not quite 40 years \\\\nold, and I keep saying my company is 40 years old. Well, that \\\\nis because it is the second generation, and my parents started \\\\nit from nothing themselves. The same with farming and ranching. \\\\nIt is five generations.\\\\n    So while I don&#x27;t have the experience of myself, I have \\\\nlearned from the experience of generations of my family, and in \\\\ntelling stories of this is what I am facing. This is what it is \\\\nlike now. The generations past, my parents, my grandparents say \\\\nto me, I can&#x27;t believe that this has happened in our great \\\\ncountry. I can&#x27;t believe that they are making it so hard for us \\\\nto feed the world and fuel the world and do it cleaner and \\\\nbetter than anywhere else in the world.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Amen.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. It is shocking. It is disheartening.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. You would testify today it has never been this \\\\nbad or even your folks, when you have lunch with them, they \\\\nsay, it has never been this bad.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. I have their history to go off of.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Very good. Well done.\\\\n    Mr. Farris, you have testified and given us that \\\\ninformation. We are now over $3 trillion in just crazy rules \\\\nand regulations that have come down. That is an all-time high. \\\\nThat is 12 percent of our GDP. How about that? Often \\\\nduplicative or just wacky rules.\\\\n    We all want to live in a safe, clean environment. But you \\\\nsay we have gone too far. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. Absolutely. I have only been around for a \\\\ncouple of decades working on this. I haven&#x27;t seen anything like \\\\nthis onslaught. Every regulation coming out near zero, every \\\\nregulation targeting consumer choice, doing away with consumer \\\\nchoice and doing away with entire industries. So, no, sir, I \\\\nhaven&#x27;t seen it as bad as this.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Ten four. Okay. So they are making rules. They \\\\nmake rules. Do they, A, give you all a chance to have input? \\\\nDon&#x27;t they come have public hearings and say, Ms. Wagner, how \\\\nwould this affect your business? Do they say to your team \\\\nmembers and members of the Manufacturers Association, do they \\\\nsay, will this adversely affect, are we going too far? Do they \\\\ngive you that opportunity? Does anybody get a chance to speak \\\\nat these rule hearings? Do they even have rule hearings?\\\\n    Mr. FARRIS. I will say that we have been asked. I don&#x27;t \\\\nbelieve that we have been listened to, but we have been asked.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Okay. That is my next question. Do you feel \\\\nlistened to or do you feel like you are just talking to a brick \\\\nwall? What do you think, Ms. Wagner? Is it a brick wall or do \\\\nyou feel like they are listening to you?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. It is a brick wall.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Brick wall.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. We have submitted through the Texas Alliance of \\\\nEnergy Producers, which represents 3,000 members in the state \\\\nof Texas of small to midsized independent operators. we have \\\\nsubmitted multiple comments with very specific here are the \\\\nproblems, here are the issues, and nothing changes. It is \\\\nfalling on deaf ears.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Would you say they have a narrative going in and \\\\nthat is what we are going to end and it doesn&#x27;t matter what you \\\\nsay? I don&#x27;t even want to hear what you say. We already know \\\\nwhat we are going to do.\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Unfortunately, I think you are correct.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Do you think they know that? In fact, this is \\\\nsomething I learned on the Steve Scalise energy tour last year, \\\\ngoing to spend a couple of days in the Gulf on a platform to \\\\nlook at how we produce energy in America, learning that no one \\\\ndoes it cleaner than America, no one does it safer than \\\\nAmerica. Do you think people that are making these rules \\\\nunderstand that? Anybody want to jump in?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. They don&#x27;t.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. They don&#x27;t. So what happens when we--what I have \\\\nlearned, would you agree with this statement, that when we, in \\\\nfact, we learn it is not a battle that the Biden administration \\\\nhas on oil and gas, it is just American oil and gas? Because \\\\nwhen we don&#x27;t allow it to be made here or produced here, we are \\\\ngoing to go somewhere else where they don&#x27;t make it as clean or \\\\nas safe as others. True statement?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Very true.\\\\n    Mr. BEAN. Very true. All right. Let&#x27;s talk about what \\\\nhappens if the unthinkable happens and Cooper Oil and Gas goes \\\\naway or just succumbs to the pressure. What happens to your \\\\nwells? What would happen?\\\\n    Ms. WAGNER. Depending on how we go away, a lot of the issue \\\\nthat we have in this country is not with responsible operators. \\\\nIt is with things from the past or things that have been forced \\\\nupon them. If regulations are forced upon small operators, \\\\nthere will be no resources for them. You will have more \\\\nabandoned wells, not more production, you will have less \\\\nproduction in the United States.\\\\n    The fallacy and all of that issue, which is its own \\\\nenvironmental hazard, is that the demand for our product goes \\\\nnowhere. We must have fossil fuels to power our lives as they \\\\nexist today and for the foreseeable future. And if you don&#x27;t \\\\nget it here, you are getting it from overseas.

The Subcommittee on Housing and \\\\nInsurance will come to order.\\\\n    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a \\\\nrecess of the subcommittee at any time.\\\\n    This long-awaited, much-anticipated hearing is entitled, \\\\n``The Factors Influencing the High Cost of Insurance for \\\\nConsumers.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I now recognize myself for 5 minutes to give an opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Today, the subcommittee will hold a hearing to discuss the \\\\nfactors influencing the high cost of insurance for consumers \\\\nacross the country. It is, unfortunately, a topic that both \\\\nfamilies and businesses are grappling with on top of the \\\\nalready-steep cost of inflation and interest rate increases.\\\\n    We welcome today the testimony of our distinguished panel \\\\nof witnesses, each of whom can address the cost and \\\\navailability of insurance from several different perspectives.\\\\n    Specifically, I would like to welcome Mr. Joseph Petrelli, \\\\nwho runs Demotech, Incorporated, which is an independent \\\\ninsurance rating agency out of Dublin, Ohio. Given his decades \\\\nof experience in the insurance industry, Joe has a unique \\\\nperspective on the challenges facing the insurance markets at \\\\nthis time.\\\\n    I look forward to hearing the insights of Joe and the rest \\\\nof our witnesses. And this hearing comes at a critical time, as \\\\nconsumers are facing record-high property and casualty \\\\ninsurance bills. Homeowners&#x27; insurance costs are surging in \\\\nmany areas, with Americans paying between $1,500 and $2,500 a \\\\nyear on average, but many communities outside of this range \\\\nhave seen premiums increase by multiples of what they had paid \\\\nin previous years. In addition, this year, the price of \\\\ncommercial property premiums experienced the largest single-\\\\nyear increase in over 20 years. Such costs are untenable for \\\\nmany, forcing homeowners to move to areas with less-expensive \\\\ncoverage, pushing up prices for rent and commercial properties \\\\nat a time when housing costs are at record highs.\\\\n    Meanwhile, losses for insurers are going up. Companies are \\\\npaying out 104 percent in claims for every premium dollar they \\\\nhave taken in thus far in 2023, which would be 4 percent more \\\\nthan what they are bringing in. Add to that the growing market \\\\nrisk stemming from widespread lawsuit abuse from trial \\\\nattorneys who are now spending hundreds of thousands of dollars \\\\neach month on paid keyword search results. Those results are \\\\ndesigned to target recent disaster victims and other insurance \\\\nclaimants and trick them into filing frivolous lawsuits.\\\\n    More and more, it seems that the insurance industry is at a \\\\ntipping point where the risks of providing insurance are making \\\\nthe cost of insurance unsustainable even in the best regulatory \\\\nenvironments, and shaping our development, which is why it is \\\\nso problematic when you have officials who ought to know better \\\\nmaking bad and politically-motivated decisions that add costs \\\\nand decrease availability for insurance.\\\\n    We have seen that often in the California market, for \\\\nexample, as discussed in committee hearings in the last year, \\\\nwhere the imposition of environmental, social, and governance \\\\n(ESG) mandates have prevented insurers from charging \\\\nactuarially-sound rates or using modern modeling tools to \\\\nmanage wildfire risk.\\\\n    We have also seen problems with the Federal Insurance \\\\nOffice (FIO), a Federal nonregulatory entity that is supposed \\\\nto monitor the industry to help actual regulators make better \\\\nchoices. Instead, we have seen the Biden Administration abuse \\\\nthe FIO and turn it into a politically-charged advocate for the \\\\nBiden Administration&#x27;s social agenda. The FIO is attempting to \\\\nbypass State insurance commissioners and add massive new costs \\\\nonto policyholders&#x27; bills through an unprecedented mandatory \\\\nclimate data call.\\\\n    In fact, this week, the FIO has made clear that they are \\\\nmoving forward with this misguided effort. Despite widespread \\\\nblowback, as I said in a March letter to FIO, that is not just \\\\nwrong; it also raises real questions about FIO&#x27;s continued \\\\nmission creep, leading to multiple bills being introduced to \\\\nrein in this spiraling-out-of-control office, all of which \\\\nbrings us to the fundamental point here. Insurance is, has \\\\nbeen, and should remain a State-regulated product, free from \\\\nthe involvement and clutches of meddling Federal bureaucrats. \\\\nSupport for the longstanding principles of the McCarran-\\\\nFerguson Act is something that every member of this committee \\\\nshould stand by and affirm as the best way to protect \\\\npolicyholders and create healthy functioning markets that \\\\nrepresent the differences in our diverse States.\\\\n    I hope everyone here will show support for that ideal \\\\ntoday. I yield back the balance of my time.\\\\n    The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the \\\\nsubcommittee, the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, for 5 \\\\nminutes for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I could ask the \\\\nsubcommittee&#x27;s indulgence for a minute, I wanted to mention \\\\nthat Mr. Frank Nutter, who was been in front of this committee \\\\nmany, many times--I have been on the committee for almost 19 \\\\nyears, and over that 19-year period, he has been here like, \\\\nevery other Thursday--is going to retire just because he wants \\\\nto be happy and selfish. He just wants to enjoy himself, and I \\\\njust wanted to use this opportunity to say thank you for all \\\\nthe times you appeared before this committee. Thank you very \\\\nmuch.\\\\n    [applause]\\\\n    Mr. Cleaver. Like most Americans, the people in my \\\\ncongressional district want to go to work, build meaningful \\\\nwealth, and provide for the safety and security of their \\\\nfamilies. Access to affordable insurance is central to that. \\\\nAmericans look to insurance to protect their homes, \\\\nautomobiles, businesses, and communities, and for the security \\\\nof knowing that, if worst comes to worst, the losses will not \\\\nbe crippling. But more and more Americans are opening their \\\\nmailboxes and checking their emails only to learn that this \\\\nprotection is being restricted, becoming significantly more \\\\ncostly, or that major insurance companies are leaving \\\\naltogether.\\\\n    Since January 2022, an astounding 31 States have witnessed \\\\ndouble-digit rate increases. For lower-income homeowners and \\\\nthose on fixed incomes, rising rates can just about wipe them \\\\nout of their homes. It increases the rental costs or forces \\\\npeople to drop insurance altogether, which might otherwise be \\\\ntheir sole source of funds to rebuild. And it is often the case \\\\nthat people in low- and moderate-income communities may both \\\\nneed insurance the most and have the least ability to pay the \\\\nincreasing cost of higher insurance premiums.\\\\n    Affordable housing providers and residents are among the \\\\nhardest hit by insurance premium hikes, and those who cannot \\\\nafford insurance sometimes go without. When Hurricane Harvey \\\\ndumped approximately 4 feet of rain on Houston, Texas, in 2017, \\\\n8 out of 10 homeowners whose properties flooded did not have \\\\nflood insurance. And in 2022, insurance covered only 60 percent \\\\nof $165 billion in total economic loss for climate-related \\\\ndisasters affecting millions of Americans.\\\\n    It is my hope that during this hearing, we can get an \\\\nanswer to how the people in this room are going to work \\\\ntogether to bring down the cost and increase the availability, \\\\nnot the political legislation put forth for this hearing as to \\\\neliminate the Federal Government&#x27;s insurance experts, but \\\\nserious bipartisan solutions to the crisis.\\\\n    We know that there are several factors contributing to the \\\\nincreasing cost and decreasing availability of insurance for \\\\nconsumers in certain areas. This includes inflation-related \\\\ncosts, rising asset prices in hazardous areas, increased cost \\\\nof risk transfer, reinsurance litigation costs, and others. The \\\\nmost significant cost increase for property insurance has been \\\\nattributed to the rising threat of climate change. As of \\\\nOctober, the U.S. set a record of 24 billion-dollar disaster \\\\nevents in 2023, totaling $57.6 billion in damages.\\\\n    Prior to 2025, insurance losses due to climate disaster \\\\nnever exceeded $50 billion. In response to climate-related \\\\nrisks, insurers can be expected to adapt their underwriting in \\\\nvarious ways, some of which have adverse implications for the \\\\navailability and affordability of insurance coverage in certain \\\\ninsurance markets. Concerning to me, there is not yet a \\\\nsystemic nationwide picture of what the climate crisis is doing \\\\nto the availability and affordability of insurance.\\\\n    Let me be clear: Under McCarran-Ferguson, insurance is \\\\ncorrectly regulated at the State level, but it is a national \\\\nresponsibility to understand, monitor, and supervise the \\\\nresponse to the insurance crisis given the great national \\\\nimplications. You don&#x27;t need to look much further than the \\\\nNational Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which was created in \\\\n1968 following widespread insurer withdrawals from offering \\\\ncoverage for flooding, to understand that insurers withdrawing \\\\nfrom the markets or rising premiums leads to increased \\\\nuninsured losses, and shifts risk to consumers, leading \\\\ntaxpayers or the government to pick the risks. Congress needs \\\\nto advance the long-term reauthorization of the NFIP. Thank \\\\nyou, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. I thank the ranking member.\\\\n    Today, we welcome the testimony of: Grace Arnold, the \\\\nCommissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce, here on \\\\nbehalf of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; \\\\nRobert Gordon, the senior vice president of policy for the \\\\nAmerican Property Casualty Insurance Association; Frank Nutter, \\\\nthe president of the Reinsurance Association of America; Joseph \\\\nPetrelli, the president and co-founder of Demotech, Inc., in \\\\nDublin, Ohio; Baird Webel, a Specialist in Financial Economics \\\\nat the Congressional Research Service; and Sharon Lewis, the \\\\nexecutive director of the Connecticut Coalition for Economic \\\\nand Environmental Justice.\\\\n    We thank each of you for taking the time to be here. You \\\\nwill each be recognized for 5 minutes for an oral presentation \\\\nof your testimony, and without objection, your written \\\\nstatements will be made a part of the record.\\\\n    Commissioner Arnold, you are now recognized for 5 minutes \\\\nto give your oral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n STATEMENT OF GRACE ARNOLD, COMMISSIONER, MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT \\\\nOF COMMERCE, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE \\\\n                      COMMISSIONERS (NAIC)\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Chairman Davidson, Ranking Member Cleaver, and \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, thank you very much for the \\\\nopportunity to testify today. My name is Grace Arnold and I am \\\\nthe Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Commerce, which \\\\nserves as the State&#x27;s insurance regulator. And as such, I am a \\\\nmember of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \\\\n(NAIC), where I am the co-vice chair of the Property and \\\\nCasualty Insurance Committee, and I serve on the Climate and \\\\nResiliency Task Force. I appreciate the opportunity to testify \\\\ntoday.\\\\n    The United States&#x27; insurance market is the single-largest \\\\nand most-competitive market in the world. State insurance \\\\nregulators supervise more than one-third of global premiums. \\\\nAnd as of 2022, property and casualty insurance companies \\\\nreported over $874 billion in direct written premiums. The U.S. \\\\nproperty and casualty insurance industry&#x27;s cash and invested \\\\nassets surpassed $2.4 trillion at the end of 2022. State \\\\nregulators share a mission to ensure a stable, competitive, and \\\\nfair insurance marketplace where U.S. consumers are well-\\\\ninformed and well-protected. States work hard to strike an \\\\nappropriate balance between insurers&#x27; solvency and product \\\\navailability and affordability. We oversee risk financing that \\\\nallows individuals and businesses to thrive, while preserving \\\\nthe ability of the sector to pay claims and otherwise meet \\\\nobligations that result from financing risk.\\\\n    As we look ahead, State regulators are addressing several \\\\nevolving dynamics. First, we are monitoring the interplay \\\\nbetween the impact of inflation on pricing and claims, the rise \\\\nof interest rates, and the fall of investment returns, and the \\\\nimpact of climate risk. These are a few of a host of other \\\\nmacroeconomic and real-world factors at play in our markets.\\\\n    This is not the first time State regulators have seen such \\\\ncyclical growth and contraction in the property insurance \\\\nmarkets, and we have taken action to address the particular \\\\nchallenges we see nationally and locally. State regulators have \\\\nthe capacity to respond swiftly and nimbly to market conditions \\\\nin each of our markets. Through the NAIC, we are able to share \\\\nideas and coordinate effective responses, though our solutions \\\\ndo not have to look the same State to State. For example, the \\\\nNAIC&#x27;s Climate Risk and Resiliency Task Force has facilitated \\\\nthe implementation of climate-related risk disclosures by 85 \\\\npercent of the insurance market. They have updated solvency \\\\nformulas to reflect hurricane, earthquake, and wildfire risks. \\\\nThey have partnered with FEMA and the Insurance Institute for \\\\nBusiness &amp; Home Safety to create more resilient and sustainable \\\\ncommunities, and established a catastrophe modeling center of \\\\nexcellence to provide modeling resources. That group is in the \\\\nprocess of a property data call to help better understand \\\\ncoverages and gaps.\\\\n    At the State level, recently, Florida implemented changes \\\\nto their claims litigation process, while California is in the \\\\nprocess of allowing insurers to consider catastrophe modeling \\\\nand reinsurance costs when requesting rate increases. In \\\\nMinnesota, we borrowed the idea for a program to help \\\\nhomeowners improve the exterior of their homes from colleagues \\\\nin Alabama and Louisiana, and adapted it to the weather perils \\\\nwe see in Minnesota. All of these initiatives are responding to \\\\nchallenges in each State&#x27;s property insurance market.\\\\n    We direct your attention to two ways that Congress can help \\\\nto improve the resilience of our housing stock and drive down \\\\nthe cost of insurance: first by reauthorizing the National \\\\nFlood Insurance Program (NFIP) on a long-term basis; and \\\\nsecond, by passing the bicameral, bipartisan Disaster \\\\nMitigation and Tax Parity Act of 2023, which would provide fair \\\\ntax treatment to State residential mitigation grants.\\\\n    Another evolving dynamic that State regulators are \\\\naddressing is the increased use of technology, Big Data, \\\\nartificial intelligence (AI), and predictive analytics to \\\\nreshape the insurance marketplace, and the way insurers \\\\napproach risk and engage with consumers. These technological \\\\ndevelopments have the potential to improve how an insurer does \\\\nbusiness and can benefit policyholders. Our written testimony \\\\nprovides context for these evolving dynamics and some of the \\\\nlongstanding and new initiatives State regulators are working \\\\non to address these challenges through the open and transparent \\\\nNAIC process. I appreciate the subcommittee&#x27;s leadership and \\\\nlook forward to answering your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Commissioner Arnold can be found \\\\non page 42 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. Mr. Gordon, you are now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes to give your oral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF ROBERT GORDON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, AMERICAN \\\\n        PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION (APCIA)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Chairman Davidson, Ranking Member Cleaver, and \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, I am Robert Gordon, senior vice \\\\npresident of the American Property Casualty Insurance \\\\nAssociation (APCIA), the primary trade association for the \\\\nproperty casualty insurance industry, and thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to testify today.\\\\n    Insurers&#x27; core business is protecting people and helping \\\\nthem recover from catastrophic losses to their homes, cars, and \\\\nbusinesses, and I would like to be here today to tell you that \\\\nthe insurance industry is extremely strong, stable, and \\\\nprofitable, but I can&#x27;t. Ratings agency, AM Best, last month \\\\ndowngraded the entire homeowners insurance industry from stable \\\\nto negative, with a total number of downgrades of homeowners \\\\nand car insurers more than doubling in just the first half of \\\\nthis year.\\\\n    APCIA reports regular financial operating results for the \\\\nindustry. Last year, insurance capital plummeted more than $73 \\\\nbillion. Our surplus contracted dramatically. Insurers&#x27; net \\\\nunderwriting losses last year were the worst in over a decade, \\\\nand for the first half of this year, for every dollar collected \\\\nin premiums, insurers paid $1.43 in claims and expenses. For \\\\nthis year, overall, S&amp;P predicts that auto insurers are going \\\\nto have an 8.7 percent net underwriting loss, and homeowners \\\\ninsurers a 12.1 percent loss, which will be the worst in over a \\\\ndecade.\\\\n    Our challenge is really simple: supply and demand \\\\neconomics. Insured costs and exposures are rapidly escalating \\\\nmuch faster than regulators are allowing rate increases. An \\\\nindustry that is losing money is just not going to be able to \\\\nattract new investment capital, and as a consequence, there is \\\\nnot enough of a supply of insurance capital to cover consumers&#x27; \\\\nincreased coverage needs.\\\\n    The average global natural catastrophe insured losses have \\\\nnearly doubled over the last decade, and the United States this \\\\nyear has experienced a record number of recent disasters, and \\\\nthose numbers are increasing. The number-one driver of property \\\\nlosses has been the accumulation of asset values in high-\\\\nclimate-risk regions that is particularly from a rapid \\\\npopulation growth in coastal areas and the wildland urban \\\\ninterface, and that is a trend that accelerated with the \\\\npandemic.\\\\n    Economic inflation is the other top last cost driver. \\\\nInflation has risen 22 percent over the last 5 years, but our \\\\ninsurance input costs have risen much faster, much higher, and \\\\nmuch worse than inflation. Used cars and trucks, which are the \\\\nbasis for auto insurance total loss settlements, increased \\\\nnearly 40 percent over the last 5 years. Building replacement \\\\nvalues increased 44 percent, more than double the cumulative \\\\ninflation rate and far more than the increase in homeowners&#x27; \\\\ninsurance. So, a home in Florida or California that someone \\\\nmight have bought 5 years ago for $400,000, now costs nearly \\\\n$600,000 to replace.\\\\n    Climate change is another cost driver as is legal system \\\\nabuse. They significantly reduce insurance affordability over \\\\ntime. Swiss Re estimates that U.S. liability claims costs rose \\\\n16 percent, on average, for the last 5 years, and that is \\\\nfueled in part by some of the secretive third-party litigation \\\\nfinancing.\\\\n    Insurance is fundamentally a risk pooling and spreading \\\\npassthrough mechanism, and in times of high inflation, \\\\nregulators want to protect consumers from price increases. But \\\\nif insurers are not allowed to pass costs through in a timely \\\\nmanner, markets are going to rapidly deteriorate, and that is \\\\nwhat is going on right now in several States, causing \\\\ndeteriorating markets and crises. Our member insurers have \\\\ninvested billions of dollars developing insurance markets and \\\\nrelationships with the policyholders, their load, the pullback \\\\nfrom those markets, but you can&#x27;t keep selling your product at \\\\na loss and remain solvent.\\\\n    Now, there are solutions that APCIA and our members have \\\\nbeen supporting--dozens of climate mitigation resiliency \\\\nprograms that can help reduce losses. It can help make \\\\ninsurance more affordable for consumers over time. The \\\\nInsurance Institute for Business &amp; Home Safety (IBHS) has \\\\ndeveloped extensive building code improvements, and very \\\\nexciting new wildfire safety standards, and we have worked \\\\nextensively with the Administration&#x27;s Wildland Fire Mitigation \\\\nand Management Commission, that has recommended a number of \\\\ngreat wildfire management and safety recommendations. And we \\\\nare supporting improved vehicle and highway safety standards, \\\\nparticularly in some of the high-risk neighborhoods, and we \\\\nhope policymakers can address inflation and climate change and \\\\nlegal system abuse.\\\\n    But ultimately, the markets are only going to stabilize \\\\nwhen the gap between rates and losses is addressed and when \\\\nproperty casualty insurers are allowed to earn a rate of return \\\\nsufficient to attract the additional investment capital needed \\\\nto cover escalating consumer exposures. Thank you, and I look \\\\nforward to your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon can be found on page \\\\n50 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. Mr. Nutter, you are now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes to give your oral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n    STATEMENT OF FRANKLIN W. NUTTER, PRESIDENT, REINSURANCE \\\\n                  ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA (RAA)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. Chairman Davidson, Ranking Member Cleaver, and \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to \\\\ntestify today and, frankly, for the many times over the years \\\\nthat this committee has honored me with that opportunity.\\\\n    At its core, insurance is the assessment of risk and a \\\\nmeans to transfer individual property risk to a larger pool of \\\\ninsurers and capital providers. It has proven to be the most-\\\\nefficient means to provide financial recovery for property \\\\nowners experiencing losses from natural catastrophes. Property \\\\ninsurance is at the intersection of extreme weather and \\\\ndecisions made by individuals and by the communities in which \\\\nthey live about the features of properties at risk and the \\\\nresilience of communities that are, in the words of one \\\\nanalyst, ``creating disasters by design.&#x27;&#x27; This is reflected in \\\\nthe trends in insured property losses from natural catastrophes \\\\nreflected in our statement. These trends are due primarily to \\\\nincreases in the number and value of properties at risk due to \\\\nextreme weather; external economic factors, such as inflation, \\\\naffecting construction costs; and increased risk vulnerability \\\\nand hazard intensification. R Street Analytics assesses that of \\\\nthe 144 million properties in the United States, fully 1 in 4 \\\\nare exposed to high risk due to wildfire, wind, and flood. \\\\nPeople are increasingly living in desirable but dangerous \\\\nplaces.\\\\n    Both the business model of insurance and the State \\\\nregulatory system that oversees it are principally \\\\nretrospective in nature, utilizing primarily past loss data. \\\\nHowever, there is tension between both retrospective models in \\\\na world of dramatically-increasing natural catastrophe risk and \\\\nrising economic factors such as inflation. The past is truly \\\\nnot prologue in this context. Failing to incorporate future \\\\nrisk assessment into insurance rates and loss mitigation \\\\nstrategies dooms communities to solutions that will quickly \\\\nbecome inadequate, subjects consumers to rate shocks as risk-\\\\nbased rates are implemented, and undermines one of the \\\\nprincipal roles of insurance, which is to communicate risk via \\\\nrates.\\\\n    The rising cost of consumer insurance has been attributed \\\\nin part to the cost of reinsurance. And insurers purchase \\\\nreinsurance for a variety of reasons: to increase capital to \\\\nsupport its portfolio of insurance in force; to diversify its \\\\nrisk profile across global and reinsurance markets; and to \\\\ntransfer the volatility of infrequent, but severe, loss events. \\\\nInsurers are not required to purchase reinsurance but do so \\\\nbecause it is a cost-efficient way to manage catastrophe risk.\\\\n    Reinsurance rates are not the principal driver of the \\\\nchanging risk landscape; they are a reflection of it. \\\\nReinsurance costs do not translate directly to consumer rates. \\\\nReinsurance contracts cover a portfolio of properties above an \\\\naggregate loss experience and are not passed through cost \\\\ndirectly to individual properties. Reinsurance contract terms \\\\nvary by insurer, and rates charged to consumers by those \\\\ninsurers incorporate many factors. Reinsurance costs, even \\\\nwhere significant, may be a small factor in consumer rates \\\\nrelative to other factors. Even if an insurer had no \\\\nreinsurance, it would still need to set its rates to reflect a \\\\ntrue risk-based rate.\\\\n    Insurers, reinsurers, and the utilization of reinsurance is \\\\nregulated for financial oversight purposes pursuant to State \\\\nlaw. That is understandable, as each State has a unique profile \\\\nrelated to its economy, its legal environment, its exposure to \\\\nnatural perils, and its philosophy of regulation. Well-meaning \\\\nbut restrictive insurance regulation is counterproductive to \\\\nachieving solutions to property insurance market issues. \\\\nInsurance regulation by each State should incorporate risk-\\\\nbased rates in a more-efficient rate review process, include a \\\\nfactor for forward-looking risk assessment, and provide \\\\nincentives for homeowners and small businesses to mitigate \\\\nrisk.\\\\n    We have identified a number of items in our written \\\\ntestimony about what Congress should do, but let me highlight \\\\nfour. The first is to reform Federal programs to incentivize \\\\npeople to live in resilient homes and communities. The second \\\\nis increased funding for pre-disaster mitigation grant programs \\\\nlike FEMA&#x27;S Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities \\\\n(BRIC) Program, and for funding for NOAA and NASA to improve \\\\nweather and climate risk assessment.\\\\n    The third is to incentivize governments through Federal \\\\ndisaster assistance to adopt Statewide building codes and use \\\\nforward-looking risk assessment in land use. And the fourth is \\\\nto enact tax credits for pre-disaster mitigation, exempt State \\\\nand local mitigation grants from Federal income taxation, and \\\\nencourage the private sector to invest in obligations of \\\\ngovernment at all levels for resilience projects like those \\\\nbenefiting from the Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act.\\\\n    We look forward to working with the committee to enhance \\\\ncommunity resilience, recovery, and disaster preparedness. \\\\nThank you.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Nutter can be found on page \\\\n83 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. Mr. Petrelli, you are now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes to give your oral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n    STATEMENT OF JOSEPH PETRELLI, PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER, \\\\n                         DEMOTECH, INC.\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Petrelli. Thank you, Chairman Davidson, Ranking Member \\\\nCleaver, and members of the subcommittee. I have been employed \\\\nin the insurance industry since 1969, when I entered The \\\\nCollege of Insurance, so I have seen over 50 years of \\\\navailability and affordability crises.\\\\n    The current one that the subcommittee is addressing is \\\\nunique in several ways. While all lines of insurance are \\\\nsubject to fluctuations in price due to claims frequency and \\\\nseverity, the material damage lines--Farmowners, Homeowners, \\\\nAutomobile physical damage--are directly impacted by the \\\\ninflationary costs on core materials--lumber, tiles, bumpers \\\\nand grills, etc.,--the inflationary costs on the salaries, \\\\nbenefits, and training of the skilled professionals who effect \\\\nrepairs, and the shortage of the skilled professionals who \\\\neffect repairs. The cost of reinsurance to spread the costs is \\\\ncertainly included in the premium, but then we also, in \\\\ncatastrophe-prone areas, look at the efficacy and calibration \\\\nof catastrophe models and the simulations upon which insurers \\\\nbase their purchase for reinsurance.\\\\n    But in addition to these traditional drivers of cost, in \\\\nthis particular availability and affordability crisis, research \\\\npioneered by Demotech, initiated in March of 2022, and \\\\nundertaken by Todd Kozikowski, a seasoned technologist with 25 \\\\nyears of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data \\\\nanalytics expertise, discovered that opportunists have been \\\\nusing the capabilities of the internet to initiate and generate \\\\ncontested claims against insurers. Demotech calls this, ``tech-\\\\nenabled claims instigation.&#x27;&#x27; It is the confluence of \\\\nlitigation financing, litigation marketing, litigation \\\\nplatforms, and search engine optimization by opportunists \\\\nseeking to secure contested claims. This is a significant \\\\ncontributor to the availability and affordability crisis that \\\\nthis subcommittee now faces.\\\\n    A few examples will give you a sense of the scope of this \\\\nissue. In the Southeast, a single law firm targeting a single \\\\nregional carrier purchased over 100 keywords in an effort to \\\\noutrank that carrier for its own claims department phone \\\\nnumber. For successful clicks, the law firm paid over $300,000 \\\\nper month. In Southern California, 19 law firms in 49 locations \\\\ntarget insurers. Those 19 law firms spend nearly a million \\\\ndollars a month in online advertising.\\\\n    In 2022, when Hurricane Ian approached Florida, and in \\\\n2023, when Hurricane Idalia approached Florida, opportunists \\\\nset up websites to enable insureds to report claims to them, \\\\nnot to insurers, 3 to 5 days before the storms were making \\\\nlandfall; they were still out in the Gulf. And as the Maui \\\\nwildfires burned, opportunists were setting up websites for \\\\npolicyholders to report claims, not to the insurers, but to the \\\\nopportunists.\\\\n    In closing, to paraphrase Allen Kerr, former Commissioner \\\\nof Insurance for the State of Arkansas from 2015 to 2020, when \\\\nhe was informed about our discovery of tech-enabled claims \\\\ninstigation, ``The threat that has been unearthed has never \\\\nbeen identified at the State or national level until now.&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nThis is a new determinant in the availability and affordability \\\\nthat this subcommittee seeks to address.\\\\n    Thank you for your time. And thank you for your kind \\\\nattention.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Petrelli can be found on \\\\npage 104 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. Mr. Webel, you are now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes to give your oral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n STATEMENT OF BAIRD WEBEL, SPECIALIST IN FINANCIAL ECONOMICS, \\\\n              CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE (CRS)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Webel. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cleaver, and \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, my name is Baird Webel. I am a \\\\nSpecialist in Financial Economics at the Congressional Research \\\\nService (CRS). And before I go into my testimony, I just want \\\\nto make sure, especially for the people listening, that we know \\\\nthat CRS is a division of the Library of Congress. We are \\\\nnonpartisan, and our job is basically to provide research and \\\\nanalysis to Members of Congress. We do not take positions on \\\\nlegislation or policy measures before Congress.\\\\n    To address the hearing topic today, basically, I see three \\\\nsomewhat interrelated factors that are driving the high prices \\\\nof insurance, and many of these have already been addressed. \\\\nYou have two broad ones in the first. In the macroeconomic \\\\nenvironment, higher inflation, higher interest rates feed \\\\nthrough fairly directly into insurance prices, and even more so \\\\nwhen you have the inflation hitting areas like building costs \\\\nand automobile replacement costs that are driving higher than \\\\nthe top line inflation.\\\\n    The other broad factor is increasing disaster losses. This \\\\nhas been going on for several decades, that the level of \\\\ncatastrophe losses has been increasing across the country, and \\\\nit hasn&#x27;t been just the sort of headline, high-level hurricane \\\\nlosses that people tend to think about. The losses are also \\\\ncoming in mid-level storms, and wildfires, which in the \\\\ninsurance parlance are called, ``secondary perils.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    The third, and more idiosyncratic factor, I would say, is \\\\nin some particular States, especially California and Florida, \\\\nyou have seen factors in the insurance regulatory environment \\\\nthat have driven market issues and market disruptions, supply \\\\ndisruptions, which will feed through into prices in those \\\\nStates. And of course, especially given the size of California \\\\nand Florida, if prices go up in those States, you will actually \\\\nsee an effect in national statistics because of the size of \\\\nthose markets.\\\\n    I think that when you look at these factors, though, of \\\\ncourse, what people immediately ask is, what can we do about \\\\nit, and for Congress, I think if there is any good news in the \\\\nsituation, it is that some of these factors are cyclical. \\\\nProperty casualty markets are prone to what is known as, ``hard \\\\nmarkets,&#x27;&#x27; where supply contracts, prices go up, and then, the \\\\nmarkets react.\\\\n    And so especially in terms of inflation, in terms of \\\\ninterest rates, we are not likely to see a situation where \\\\ninflation basically goes from almost zero to 6 or 7 percent \\\\nagain, and that shock is one of the things that really drives \\\\nthe problem in an insurance market. Insurance carriers in the \\\\npast, in the 1970s, adapted to inflation that was much higher \\\\nthan what we have today. But when you have a shock where you go \\\\nfrom essentially zero to a higher amount, that drives \\\\ndisruption in the market.\\\\n    Equally, I think some of the States, both California and \\\\nFlorida, have at least started to address some of the problems \\\\nin terms of changing some policies and changing some laws. And \\\\nthat works through the markets, then the markets in those \\\\nStates may stabilize to some degree, which leads to the third \\\\nfactor, which is driving higher catastrophe and disaster \\\\nlosses, and this, frankly, is a much harder thing to deal with.\\\\n    I think that at one level, what you can do is you need to \\\\ndo whatever one can to try to drive down those losses through \\\\nmitigation, as was mentioned, through grant programs, through \\\\nhardening properties, through trying to address the wildfire \\\\nissues in terms of forest management, and really, a whole host \\\\nof different things that the Federal Government might do.\\\\n    At the insurance side, in the past, the Federal Government \\\\nhas addressed sort of supply issues like this in the market in \\\\nseveral different ways. In the National Flood Insurance Program \\\\n(NFIP), you see direct Federal provision of insurance when the \\\\nmarket failed. In the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, you saw a \\\\nFederal provision, basically reinsurance, to provide a backstop \\\\nto the market as it started to fail. And also in the third, in \\\\nthe Liability Risk Retention Act in the 1980s, you saw what was \\\\nessentially a deregulatory approach to try to increase private \\\\nsupply in the market.\\\\n    So, those are probably the only three times that you have \\\\nseen fairly deep Federal involvement in these kinds of issues. \\\\nIt does not happen a lot, but it has happened, and I know that \\\\npeople are talking about using some models like that \\\\npotentially in the future. With that, I will end my testimony, \\\\nand I look forward to any questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Webel can be found on page \\\\n106 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. Ms. Lewis, you are now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes to give your oral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF SHARON LEWIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CONNECTICUT \\\\n        COALITION FOR ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. Chairman Davidson, Ranking Member Cleaver, and \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to \\\\ntestify today. I have spent more than 2 decades in the \\\\ninsurance and reinsurance industry. Now, I am the executive \\\\ndirector of the Connecticut Coalition for Economic and \\\\nEnvironmental Justice, where I work with low-income communities \\\\nand communities of color, who are facing health challenges due \\\\nto disproportionate exposures to pollution where they live, \\\\nwork, recreate, and pray.\\\\n    Climate change is an undeniable reality, and consumers are \\\\npaying more for less when it comes to insurance while worrying \\\\nabout their coverage, worrying about whether or not the \\\\ncoverage will be reduced or canceled entirely. With every \\\\nclimate-related weather event, I see the same people destroyed \\\\nbut not being able to recover from the devastating financial \\\\neffects. I see people who have managed to accumulate a modicum \\\\nof wealth but lose it in an instant as a result of a hurricane, \\\\nflood, wildfire, heavy rain, et cetera, because they didn&#x27;t \\\\nhave adequate coverage or had no coverage at all, yet they pay \\\\nmore for, ``insurance,&#x27;&#x27; than anyone else.\\\\n    For a community to become uninhabitable, it only needs to \\\\nbe uninsurable. This has been a historic problem for low-income \\\\ncommunities and communities of color. Think about urban \\\\nrenewal. Due to a history of government-sanctioned racial \\\\npolicies such as redlining and restrictive covenants, which led \\\\nto the abandonment and underinvestment in these communities, \\\\nthey now face disproportionate threats from climate disasters \\\\nwhich can leave them traumatized by the devastating \\\\nshortcomings of the insurance claims process.\\\\n    Insurance, by design, is supposed to protect one&#x27;s assets, \\\\nbut in communities of color, it has too often eroded their \\\\nassets through discriminatory underwriting and claims policies. \\\\nClimate change is also revealing an under-insurance crisis as \\\\ninsurers transfer the risk to their policyholders through ever-\\\\nincreasing deductibles, low property value assessments, or \\\\npolicies that only offer actual cash value rather than \\\\nreplacement costs.\\\\n    After disasters, insufficient coverage can often force a \\\\nhousing crisis as well as people tend to start from square one, \\\\ncreating a vicious cycle of displacement. No insurance means no \\\\nmortgage, so it could also create a mortgage crisis. This is \\\\nalso true for renters who pay higher rental insurance premiums, \\\\nif they can get it at all, or pay higher rental costs to cover \\\\nthe landlord&#x27;s premiums.\\\\n    As climate change accelerates an insurance crisis, we need \\\\nto pay close attention to the concerning underwriting \\\\npractices, like the use of credit scores to determine premiums, \\\\nwhich can force people of color to pay far more for insurance, \\\\nregardless of whether they have an undesirable risk or have \\\\neven filed claims. There is also a clear double standard in who \\\\npays the costs of climate change. While insurance have been \\\\ndropping homeowners&#x27; policies, they continue to invest in and \\\\nprovide insurance for new fossil fuel projects, which will only \\\\nincrease the threats to people&#x27;s homes and lives through \\\\nclimate change. The CEOs of these companies should have to \\\\npublicly explain this contradiction to all of us.\\\\n    Ultimately, the best policy to protect consumers is to \\\\nreduce the risk. Congress should work to reduce carbon \\\\nemissions and invest in resiliency projects to prevent \\\\ncommunities that contribute the least to climate change from \\\\npaying the most.\\\\n    Finally, Congress should work with impacted communities and \\\\nconsumer advocates to consider a backstop that could serve as a \\\\nreinsurance relief valve. In 2002, you provided relief for Wall \\\\nStreet for terrorism insurance after 9/11. This time, we need a \\\\nsafety net for those on Main Street who have been terrorized by \\\\nhigher premiums, higher deductibles, coverage restrictions, and \\\\nmarket withdrawals. Thank you so much for this opportunity to \\\\nspeak today.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Lewis can be found on page \\\\n78 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. I thank all of our witnesses \\\\nfor your oral remarks, and I look forward to the questions. We \\\\nwill now turn to Member questions, and I recognize myself for 5 \\\\nminutes of questions.\\\\n    Mr. Petrelli, the company you founded with your wife, \\\\nSharon, Demotech, Incorporated, independently reviews and rates \\\\n450 insurers operating in every State. In addition to the \\\\ntraditional drivers of insurance costs, you have recently done \\\\na lot of work on a new and troubling expense category that you \\\\njust highlighted in your remarks, tech-enabled claims \\\\ninstigation, which is exploding costs, particularly in places \\\\nwhere we see more-frequent natural disasters. Could you tell us \\\\nhow they work together and how this phenomenon is contributing \\\\nto higher premiums?\\\\n    Mr. Petrelli. Chairman Davidson, Ranking Member Cleaver, \\\\nyes, thank you. What we have seen is the turmoil associated \\\\nwith a natural disaster, whether it is flood, hail, tornado, \\\\nearthquake, hurricane, or whatever it may be, that turmoil \\\\nserves as sort of ground cover and camouflage for the efforts. \\\\nAnd it creates an opportunity for opportunists to utilize \\\\ntechnology to secure contested claims when there might not have \\\\nbeen a contested claim.\\\\n    We had a situation recently in Louisiana with McClenny \\\\nMoseley &amp; Associates, where there were almost 1,000 people who \\\\nwere represented by counsel, who did not know they were \\\\nrepresented by counsel. And it winds up with what is called in \\\\nthe insurance industry, first notice of loss, becomes a lawsuit \\\\nas opposed to an inquiry from your insured as to what the claim \\\\nmight be. And what we are seeing is we have always had \\\\nlitigation in the insurance business, but we now have another \\\\nlayer of litigation that is being imposed through tech-enabled \\\\nclaims instigation. If there is a follow-up question, I would \\\\nbe glad to take it.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. No. I thank you for highlighting that, \\\\nand I look forward to research, and I hope my colleagues will \\\\npay attention to that, and frankly, that our State-based \\\\nregulators will pay attention to that, because it is just \\\\nanother predatory practice people are adapting to the times, \\\\nand instead of just distributing risks, it is actually \\\\nconcentrating it. It kind of works at odds with the point of \\\\ninsurance.\\\\n    Shifting gears, earlier this year, the NAIC put forward a \\\\nproposal to expand the reach of its own Securities Valuation \\\\nOffice (SVO). The proposal would give the SVO the power to \\\\noverrule the rating agencies&#x27; determination when the SVO \\\\ndecides that it disagrees with the agency&#x27;s ratings. This SVO \\\\nexpansion would essentially make the NAIC an unregulated, de \\\\nfacto nationally-recognized statistical rating organization, \\\\nand create a conflict of interest between its role as a trade \\\\nassociation representing State-based insurance regulators and \\\\nan asset evaluator setting capital charge rules for insurance \\\\ncompanies. That is why earlier this year, I and seven of my \\\\ncolleagues on the committee sent the NAIC a letter expressing \\\\nserious concerns with their proposal. We are concerned that \\\\nthis SVO overreach would lead to less transparency and more \\\\nambiguity for insurance companies, and actual damage to market \\\\nefficiencies, which would drive up costs for consumers.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon, do you see how this could be a conflict of \\\\ninterest, given the NAIC&#x27;s dual role as a trade association for \\\\nall State insurance regulators and an evaluator of investment \\\\ndecisions of its member insurance companies?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Yes, Mr. Chairman, we would agree with that. \\\\nThe Securities Valuation Office has continually tried to assert \\\\nmore control over securities ratings, including giving itself \\\\ndiscretion, for a fee, to evaluate some of these products, but \\\\nthere is no provision for appropriate supervision by State \\\\nregulators, as you know, very limited transparency, no right to \\\\nappeal to an independent third party, and no opportunity for \\\\ninsurers and rating agencies to present their data. We have \\\\nobjected to the proposal, and I think it needs a lot more \\\\ntransparency and due process before it is further considered.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you for your testimony. I just \\\\nwant to quickly turn to the Federal Insurance Office (FIO). \\\\nBack in March, I sent a letter to the FIO regarding its \\\\npolitically-motivated effort to collect climate change data. It \\\\nis expansive beyond its actual scope. Instead of working \\\\ndirectly with State insurance regulators, it is going straight \\\\nto the companies and basically trying to extract data. One of \\\\nour colleagues, Mr. Fitzgerald, has a bill, H.R. 5535, the \\\\nInsurance Data Protection Act, which would strip the FIO of \\\\nsubpoena power that it is actually abusing. Does anyone on this \\\\npanel think getting rid of that power would compromise the \\\\noriginal intended purpose of the FIO?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. We would strongly support that, Mr. Chairman. \\\\nIt is an incredibly unusual, unique subpoena power for a \\\\nnonregulatory agency.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. Anyone else?\\\\n    [No response.]\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. I think, as my time rapidly winds down, \\\\nthe ability to distribute risk is an underappreciated essential \\\\ncomponent of market function, and it frankly preserves capital \\\\nif it is done properly, so I think it is great that you all \\\\ncould be here.\\\\n    My time has expired, and I now recognize the gentlewoman \\\\nfrom New York, Ms. Velazquez.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner \\\\nArnold, I am concerned about the rapidly-increasing insurance \\\\ncosts for multifamily housing properties serving low-income New \\\\nYorkers. Some affordable housing properties cannot get an \\\\ninsurance quote at all, with fewer carriers willing to bid on \\\\nproperties that serve rent-subsidized tenants, and some \\\\noutright refusing. What can be done to ensure affordable \\\\nhousing properties have access to property insurance at \\\\naffordable and reasonable rates?\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Thank you for the question, Representative \\\\nVelazquez. The market looks a little different in each State. \\\\nFor the most part, our insurance markets are competitive. There \\\\nare a lot of carriers. We have seen that when folks shop \\\\naround, that is a way to get better coverage or a reduced cost. \\\\nI talked to a gentleman recently who saved $800 a year, which I \\\\nwas quite surprised at, so it is also something that we are \\\\nlooking at, and we are thinking about the ways that we can \\\\nensure that there is access to coverage, and we do that through \\\\nour regulatory process.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. And this question is for the panel. In \\\\nSeptember, not only did Republican brinkmanship here in the \\\\nHouse bring us to the verge of a government shutdown, but it \\\\nalso brought us precariously close to an expiration of the \\\\nNational Flood Insurance Program. This was on the same day we \\\\nwere experiencing a massive rainstorm and significant flooding \\\\nin New York City. By a show of hands, how many of you think it \\\\nwill be a terrible idea to allow the NFIP to expire?\\\\n    [Hands raised.]\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. Similarly, by a show of hands, \\\\nhow many of you think we should stop lurching from deadline to \\\\ndeadline with the NFIP and instead pass a long-term reform and \\\\nreauthorization bill?\\\\n    [Hands raised.]\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Nutter and Mr. Gordon, both of your organizations have \\\\nclosely tracked the impact of Risk Rating 2.0. In each of your \\\\nviews, has Risk Rating 2.0 worked to lower rates nationwide? \\\\nWhat about in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities and \\\\ncommunities of color in high-risk areas?\\\\n    Mr. Nutter?\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. Yes. Thank you for the question. We do believe \\\\nthat Risk Rating 2.0 will bring more equity into the rating for \\\\nflood insurance policies. It needs to be understood that the \\\\nformer program, let&#x27;s call it Risk Rating 1.0, and Risk Rating \\\\n2.0 were both required by Congress to meet a certain rate \\\\nadequacy level, so they are both on that track. What Risk \\\\nRating 2.0 does is it eliminates this cross-subsidy of people \\\\nat low risk of flood, of people who are high risk of flood, and \\\\nit does bring equity into that by looking at property specific. \\\\nOur analysis would suggest that a significant portion of the \\\\nproperties that, in fact, are covered under the policy are \\\\ngoing to receive lower rates, and many of them are going to \\\\nreceive basically the kind of rates that would have been \\\\nhappening under Risk Rating 1.0 anyway.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. Do you foresee any positive impact on \\\\nunderserved communities and communities of color?\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. Absolutely. I think what Risk Rating 2.0 is \\\\ngoing to do, is to bring more equitable rates to communities of \\\\ncolor and communities that are socially and economically \\\\nvulnerable.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. Mr. Gordon?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. I generally agree with my colleague, Mr. \\\\nNutter. I would note that when the Federal Government creates \\\\nsubsidies for the environment, it can mask not only what the \\\\ntrue cost is, but it can also, in essence, mask the \\\\nenvironmental signals that we are not recognizing those \\\\nenvironmental risks, and that is what is going on.\\\\n    If Congress wants to address the very important concerns \\\\nthat you have raised, perhaps some sort of a very transparent \\\\nmeans testing program to help those people, as well as the \\\\nright kind of mitigation investments in those communities that \\\\ncan help them withstand the flood, is probably a much better \\\\nalternative than trying to mask those very important \\\\nenvironmental risk signals.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentlelady yields back. The \\\\ngentleman from Florida, Mr. Posey, is now recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Arnold, given the \\\\ncommitment to the State primacy for insurance regulation in the \\\\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act and the success of the NAIC in meeting \\\\nthe needs of interstate commerce through coordination among the \\\\nStates, what, if any, is the role of the Federal Government on \\\\ninsurance?\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Thanks for the question. The State regulators, \\\\nas you have noted, are the insurance regulators within the \\\\ncountry. We have the authorities to oversee the financial \\\\nsolvency, to approve policies that are sold, and to do data \\\\ncollection. As you noted, we are the regulators of the \\\\nindustry. Certainly, we are in conversations with the Federal \\\\nInsurance Office about the activities that they are working on, \\\\nand I think we have, as everyone here does, a shared interest \\\\nin consumer protection and the solvency and health of the \\\\nindustry. But at the end of the day, we are the State \\\\nregulators. We are the regulators.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Mr. Gordon, same question.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. When the FIO and the State regulators are \\\\nworking together, particularly internationally, it can help \\\\nsupport our international voice. But when we have the FIO \\\\nstarting to set arbitrary thresholds for domestic insurance \\\\naffordability, it becomes more problematic when they second-\\\\nguess the regulators. We have particularly strong concerns \\\\nabout FIO&#x27;s unnecessary data calls that we discussed earlier. \\\\nIt&#x27;s incredibly unusual for a nonregulator to have that kind of \\\\nexpansive subpoena authority.\\\\n    We really hope that the FIO can work with the State \\\\ninsurance commissioners, who are the primary regulators, and \\\\nboth of them can coordinate with each other, and conduct any \\\\ndata calls through existing State reporting systems and the \\\\nstatistical aggregators. And hopefully, Congress can help \\\\nencourage that communication, but we need the States as our \\\\nprimary regulators without being second-guessed.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Mr. Gordon, one of the reasons given for the \\\\nspiraling insurance costs in Florida has been the structure of \\\\nlitigation, for example, the assignment of benefits. I think \\\\nthat is what Mr. Petrelli was talking about, the leeches and \\\\nparasites, bottom feeders or whatever didn&#x27;t inject themselves \\\\ninto this process. What reforms and litigation processes would \\\\nyou recommend to help tame the increases in their premiums and \\\\nmake insurance more affordable?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Great question, Congressman, and Florida&#x27;s \\\\nleadership over the last year has adopted very historic, \\\\nsignificant, legal system abuse reforms trying to rein in one \\\\nway attorney fees, fan of damages, and assignment of benefits.\\\\n    One giant stone left unturned is third-party litigation \\\\nfinancing. We have billions of dollars pouring into funding \\\\nU.S. lawsuits from unidentified parties, oftentimes, even \\\\nunidentified foreign sovereign wealth funds, and some of the \\\\ncivil defendants and courts don&#x27;t even know when it is \\\\nhappening.\\\\n    A related challenge is third-party medical financing, where \\\\nyou have unknown third parties who are essentially in cahoots \\\\nwith the medical providers to maximize the medical services and \\\\ncosts, while trying to force insurance to pick up the bill. \\\\nFees charged are often far in excess of normal rates, and we \\\\nhave no transparency in this area. We have very little \\\\nregulation to protect the consumers. We really need some more \\\\ntransparency in this third-party funding to stop the \\\\nfraudulent, usurious activities. In any legislation, or \\\\noversight investigation, transparency can be very helpful.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Thank you. Mr. Webel, the Government \\\\nAccountability Office (GAO) has written many times over the \\\\nyears that the Federal Government should not purchase insurance \\\\nbut should self-insure. Some of this is apparently based on the \\\\nfact that the Federal Government has little reason for the same \\\\nrisk adversity as private entities. Can you please explain and \\\\nexpand on GAO&#x27;s persistent position on this matter?\\\\n    Mr. Webel. I would assume, essentially, when you look at it \\\\nfrom an economic perspective, insurance is typically something \\\\nyou buy for a risk that you cannot cover. If you are purchasing \\\\ninsurance, I would typically recommend someone get as high a \\\\ndeductible as possible to minimize the cost to themselves for \\\\nwhat they are buying. If you look at the Federal Government and \\\\nthe Federal Government&#x27;s resources to cover what insurance \\\\nmight cover, at least as we have been able to borrow, the kind \\\\nof rates that Treasury has borrowed at and the like, it \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t, from a purely financial perspective and most things, \\\\nmake much sense to purchase insurance.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Okay. My time has expired, Mr. Chairman. Thank \\\\nyou. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. I thank the gentleman. The Chair now \\\\nrecognizes the ranking member of the full Financial Services \\\\nCommittee, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for this \\\\nhearing. I have been listening to our witnesses here today and, \\\\nof course, thinking a lot about my State of California, where \\\\nwe have had insurance companies exit the market or change in \\\\nsome way because of the powers and the catastrophes we have \\\\nhad. With the fact that the States basically are the regulators \\\\nof insurance, why are we here today?\\\\n    To whom can I ask this question? Let&#x27;s see, we have a lot \\\\nof experts out here. What are you recommending as responses to \\\\nthe fact that insurance companies believe that the premiums \\\\nthat people pay do not cover the costs of the catastrophe when \\\\nit takes place? And while you are answering this question, I \\\\nwould like to know, what role does climate change play in all \\\\nof this, and if you have any recommendations, or you have some \\\\nspecial information, what would that be? Who would like to \\\\nstart off with this? Ms. Lewis, can you help us out?\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. I will try to help you out a little bit. You \\\\ndon&#x27;t need to be a climate scientist or a Congressperson to see \\\\nhow climate change is impacting people, including in my \\\\ncommunity in Hartford, Connecticut, and around the United \\\\nStates. Of course, climate change is a main factor in \\\\ninfluencing recent insurance price increases. Of course, \\\\nclimate change is a main factor in influencing the exiting of \\\\ninsurance companies from entire States. Of course, climate \\\\nchange plays a major factor in the increase in premiums. I have \\\\nprovided written testimony which will further explain why I \\\\nfeel so strongly about this, and I would like for you to refer \\\\nto that, if you don&#x27;t mind?\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. We have some other \\\\nwitnesses here that I would like to hear from based on \\\\nrecommendations, based on what we know is happening in the \\\\nindustry. Let&#x27;s see, Mr. Robert Gordon, you are the senior vice \\\\npresident of the American Property Casualty Insurance \\\\nAssociation, so you must know a lot. What do you know about \\\\nwhat the Federal Government should be doing and could be doing \\\\nat this time?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. I may know a lot, but my kids remind me every \\\\nday, nowhere near as much as is they do. But one thing we do \\\\nknow is that according to the NAIC&#x27;s most-recent report on \\\\nprofitability, insurers in California had a 6-percent net \\\\nunderwriting loss over the last decade. In California, \\\\nhomeowners&#x27; insurance claims were more than 13 percent higher \\\\nthan the premiums, and the wildfires in 2017 and 2018 wiped out \\\\nmore than 30 years of underwriting profit, so there have been \\\\nenormous losses. There have been bad rate delays for insurers \\\\nto try and catch rates up to these losses where, often, it \\\\ntakes a year to get filings approved.\\\\n    I will say, though, that to their credit, the California \\\\nGovernor and the California Insurance Commissioner both \\\\ncommitted to making significant reforms in those markets, \\\\nincluding allowing forward-looking modeling to take climate \\\\nchange into account, to improve the rate filing process, and to \\\\naddress the intervener process to allow reinsurance costs to be \\\\nfactored in. So, there is a recognition that the California \\\\nmarket is rapidly deteriorating, and it needs to be fixed.\\\\n    And I think that is best summed up by the California \\\\nInsurance Commissioner, who said that insurance companies will \\\\nnot write insurance, especially in high-risk areas, unless they \\\\nare able to ensure they have the capital and reserves to meet \\\\nall of the claims submitted by consumers, cover their expenses, \\\\nand earn a fair rate of return. We are committed to work----\\\\n    Ms. Waters. If I may interrupt you for a moment? I want to \\\\nknow if anywhere in that testimony, you are recommending high \\\\npremiums to cover the costs of these losses?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Yes. Ultimately, insurers will need to make \\\\nenough in premiums to be able to pay losses long term.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. That is exactly what I do not want to hear. \\\\nThank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. I thank the gentlelady. The gentleman \\\\nfrom Missouri, Mr. Luetkemeyer, who is also the Chair of our \\\\nSubcommittee on National Security and Illicit Finance, is now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It was a \\\\nbreathtaking comment a minute ago about how you can pay your \\\\nexpenses without any income. I don&#x27;t know how that works. \\\\nInsurance companies, like any other business, as far as I \\\\nunderstand, as far as I know your business model, you take in \\\\npremiums to be able to pay the losses that you incur, and if \\\\nyou are taking in less premium, you have less ability to pay \\\\nthat. Would that not be the case, Mr. Gordon?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. That is absolutely right.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. And the losses that you are talking about \\\\nhere: autos, 8 percent; and homeowners, 12 percent. I guess the \\\\nquestion I have is with regards to frequency or numbers of \\\\noccurrences. Is the frequency roughly the same as it has been \\\\nin inflation as additional cost of the loss here, or is it \\\\nincreasing frequency, increasing numbers of losses as well as \\\\ninflation and a cost to be able to make people whole?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. It is inflation. It is people moving into the \\\\nhigher-risk areas. There are things, for example, much more \\\\nfrequent, severe convective storms, thunderstorms, although \\\\nthat is generally understood by the industry not to be impacted \\\\nby climate change. There are things like increasing droughts \\\\nand wildfires that are more impactful. But inflation and the \\\\ndemographic shifts are the top cost drivers at the moment.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. People like to live in certain places, but \\\\nit also means that they are living in places where you actually \\\\nhave more losses or they are more susceptible to sustaining a \\\\nloss. Would that be correct?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Very good. Mr. Nutter, thank you for your \\\\nservice and for many years of being able to appear in front of \\\\nthis committee. I am sure you have some stories to tell, but we \\\\nwill leave that for another day. I wish you well on your \\\\nretirement. Quick question for you, a few years ago, I chaired \\\\nthis subcommittee, and we were working on flood insurance. I \\\\nhave been an advocate for a long, long time of reinsurance to \\\\nbe able to minimize the taxpayers&#x27; exposure on flood insurance. \\\\nThey now have some, but in my view, not nearly enough. Would \\\\nyou like to explain to us the benefits of reinsurance for the \\\\nNational Flood Insurance Program, so you can minimize the \\\\ntaxpayers&#x27; risk?\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. Thank you, Representative Luetkemeyer. The \\\\nreinsurance that the National Flood Insurance Program purchases \\\\nhas, in fact, been a valuable way to insulate the taxpayer, \\\\nlargely through the borrowing from Treasury, by calling upon \\\\nprivate-sector resources, reinsurance, if they aren&#x27;t willing \\\\nto pay claims. The first year of the Program, which I think was \\\\n2017, the Federal Government collected from the industry over a \\\\nbillion dollars in losses just like an insurance company would \\\\nfor losses that it has. So, I do think it is an effective \\\\nprogram, and, frankly, it is a way for the insurance sector to \\\\nunderstand better the flood risk with a view toward developing \\\\nmore of a private flood insurance market.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Do you think it would be a good idea for \\\\nus as legislators to look at doing this in other areas of \\\\ngovernment, where we could pass off some of the risk to the \\\\nprivate sector versus having taxpayers take on all this risk?\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. There are some existing programs that do just \\\\nexactly that. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase risk transfer \\\\nproducts from the private reinsurance sector. The EXIM Bank \\\\ndoes the same thing. The one area that is poised for that \\\\nopportunity is the banking sector, and under the Basel III \\\\nEndgame, the banks are permitted, in fact, encouraged to buy \\\\nreinsurance as part of their risk transfer. That is not yet \\\\ntrue in the United States, but given that the Federal Reserve, \\\\nthe OCC, and the FDIC are considering new bank capital \\\\nstandards, we have advanced a proposal that they should do as \\\\nsome of these other Federal agencies have done, that permit \\\\nbanks to get diversification for their capital base.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Mr. Webel, would you like to join in?\\\\n    Mr. Webel. Yes. I would just add one other thing, that I \\\\nthink, in the context of the NFIP, the reinsurance by \\\\npurchasing it now basically has the effect of drawing future \\\\nlosses to the present. The way the NFIP was designed before \\\\nthis essentially was, if you had the same policyholders, it \\\\nwould be fine. But when you have a policyholder who has a house \\\\nand then they sell it, and then to the next person, the first \\\\npolicyholder who held it for 10 years and didn&#x27;t have a claim \\\\nessentially was getting what amounted to a subsidized rate \\\\nbecause they weren&#x27;t paying the same look-forward that you \\\\nwould in a normal insurance context. And buying the reinsurance \\\\nnow essentially brings some of those future losses to the \\\\ncurrent.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. Mr. Petrelli, very quickly--my time \\\\nis running out here--you talked about the tech-enabled folks \\\\nwho are actually trying to rip off the insurance companies. I \\\\nhadn&#x27;t heard that there was an orchestrated effort out there. \\\\nThere seems to be a cottage industry of ambulance chasers out \\\\nthere, but you have taken it to a whole other level with what \\\\nyou were describing. Would you like to elaborate on this a \\\\nlittle bit? We have groups of attorneys out there who use \\\\nalgorithms to go out and put together claims against companies?\\\\n    Mr. Petrelli. Yes, sir. It is Moneyball. It is litigation \\\\nplatforms, litigation funding. The money that comes into the \\\\nlitigation, financing area, Bloomberg in 2022----\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. My time is up. Really very quickly, what \\\\nis the additional cost on an average insurance policy? Does it \\\\ngo up 2 percent, or 10 percent, as a result of this activity?\\\\n    Mr. Petrelli. I would guess, based on the frequency, it \\\\nmight be as much as 30 percent or 40 percent.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Oh, my gosh. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. The \\\\nranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from \\\\nMissouri, Mr. Cleaver, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am not sure, I \\\\nthink Mr. Gordon mentioned means testing, and I want to connect \\\\nthe means testing user with some other issues. Primarily, we \\\\nhave had congressional hearings on the issue of nonprofit \\\\norganizations and insurance. And there are a number of \\\\nnonprofits which are struggling with this, most especially \\\\nthose who work with animals, and children, and senior citizens, \\\\nand the disabled, as well as churches, synagogues, mosques, and \\\\ntemples, and they are now really struggling to get the \\\\ninsurance they need to survive.\\\\n    And when you think about the fact that there more than 60 \\\\nnonprofits in my congressional district, including the United \\\\nWay of Greater Kansas City, the Veterans Community Project, and \\\\nGoodwill of Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas, and the \\\\nmembers receive liability insurance from the nonprofit \\\\ninsurance alliance, but they are saying that they are still \\\\nchallenged. Mr. Gordon, I am interested in what I can tell them \\\\nabout their struggles and what we can do to repair it?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Actually, a member of ours, and certainly \\\\nCongress has looked at these issues in the past when there were \\\\nhard markets and liability to find solutions. Now, we are \\\\nseeing some hard markets on the property side, although it \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t appear to be a capacity issue at this point; it is \\\\nreally more of a market rate freedom issue. So if we can get \\\\nthe right rates, we can provide the additional coverages. I \\\\nthink that there may be some groups where those coverages \\\\nbecome less affordable. And that is where policymakers need to \\\\ndecide whether it is a transparent means testing or whether it \\\\nis providing very targeted mitigation resiliency. Certainly, it \\\\nis better to try and reduce the loss cost to which those groups \\\\nwould be exposed.\\\\n    Mr. Cleaver. Ms. Arnold?\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Thank you for the question. I think making sure \\\\nthat there is insurance, particularly for the entities that are \\\\nproviding really critical services to our constituents, is \\\\nsomething that all insurance commissioners take very seriously. \\\\nThere have been a number of solutions that have been proposed. \\\\nGenerally speaking, we are the regulators, and we generally \\\\noppose any time there is a Federal solution to a place where \\\\nthere is a State solution in place. And this is one of those \\\\ncases.\\\\n    I will say that we have a data call that is going out to \\\\ntry to understand this challenge a little bit better. We \\\\ncertainly want to make sure that there is access for some of \\\\nthese critical services. We will be looking at the data that \\\\ncomes in, and we will perhaps be following up, but maybe we \\\\nwill get a better understanding of the particular challenges \\\\nand where we need to be thinking as State regulators to see \\\\nwhether there are any policies that we need to be looking at, \\\\nor any changes to the way that we do business.\\\\n    Mr. Cleaver. To all of you, the more difficult the problems \\\\nthey are trying to address, the greater their insurance needs. \\\\nAnd people who are doing the Lord&#x27;s work--I am not just talking \\\\nabout religious institutions, but dealing with tough situations \\\\nwith human beings, and that reward is you have to pay. The \\\\ninsurance is going to skyrocket on you, and I don&#x27;t think this \\\\nis a partisan issue. I think it is a serious issue that we \\\\nreally need some direction on. Would anyone else like to \\\\naddress this?\\\\n    Mr. Petrelli. If I may, on the issue of the tech-enabled \\\\nclaims instigation, to give you a sense of the growth of their \\\\nproblem, according to a National Law Journal article from \\\\nNovember of 2021, there were 800 professionals using a \\\\nparticular litigation platform. Fifteen months later, there was \\\\na press release on that same litigation platform. It had 45,000 \\\\nprofessionals using it in 15 months, from 800 to 45,000. I \\\\nwould respectfully submit that your constituencies are being \\\\ntargeted, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you very much, sir. I wasn&#x27;t actually \\\\ndoing it either, but thank you very much. I appreciate the \\\\nadditional time, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman \\\\nfrom Wisconsin, Mr. Fitzgerald, is now recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For about 150 \\\\nyears, State insurance regulators and laws have regulated \\\\ninsurance companies. I know in my own State of Wisconsin, where \\\\nI was a member of the Wisconsin Center for 25 years, we always \\\\nhad a great relationship with our insurance commissioner. The \\\\nmarket and the corporations that operate and function, whether \\\\nit is property and casualty, or health or life, whatever it \\\\nmight be, they do a fantastic job. But what we have here is, \\\\nonce again, something that most State legislators really \\\\nbristle at, and that is a Federal overreach.\\\\n    The FIO has grown increasingly aggressive, as has been \\\\ndiscussed by the chairman, and as a consequence of that, we are \\\\noffering legislation. The collecting of data, and most \\\\nrecently, issuing a revised proposed data collection for \\\\nclimate-related financial risk just puts us in a position of \\\\nonce again trying to push back. So, not only has the FIO been \\\\nunclear on what they are going to do with this information and \\\\nthe data that they have collected, but any effort by Treasury \\\\nor the FIO to sidestep State insurance regulators just \\\\nblatantly undermines the congressional intent in this area. As \\\\nthe chairman said, that is why we have introduced the Insurance \\\\nData Protection Act to repeal the FIO&#x27;s subpoena power.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon, I know you have already commented on this, but \\\\ncould you maybe take it a step further in the way you view the \\\\nsubpoena power and how it is being abused right now?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Yes. We are very appreciative of your \\\\nleadership on this issue, Congressman, and we have not found \\\\none single other example of a nonregulator having such \\\\nexpansive subpoena authority. And there is no reason for them \\\\nto get into this, because majority of the States have already \\\\nbeen conducting climate data calls.\\\\n    As Ms. Arnold noted in her testimony, for 85 percent of the \\\\nmarketplace, analyzing weather is already the primary \\\\ncompetency of the insurance industry, which has been doing it \\\\nfor hundreds of years, investing money and analyzing and \\\\nmanaging weather risks. So, this is something that is not \\\\nrelated to insurance. It is second-guessing the regulators. We \\\\nare working with the regulators very extensively on this. They \\\\nare spending a lot of time. There is an enormous amount of \\\\nclimate-related insurance data already available to the public \\\\nand we are working with our State regulators to make sure there \\\\nare no gaps in that.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. I would further comment that I think some \\\\nof the data calls are so broad that you start to worry about \\\\nwhether or not they are adequately protecting this information \\\\nonce it has been gathered. What kind of assurance do you think \\\\nthat FIO could give to anybody saying, don&#x27;t worry about the \\\\nState, it has all been guarded in and safely capped?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. We are always nervous. The more parties that \\\\nhave information, the more potential problems there are. We \\\\nhave encouraged the FIO in past efforts to gather information, \\\\nto work with the NAIC to have the data done through existing \\\\nportals, to be aggregated, to protect against the kind of \\\\ndangers that you are talking about. So, there are ways to do \\\\nit, again, most importantly, involving cooperation with the \\\\nState regulators.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I would just say, \\\\nthis is once again a classic Federal overreach for data that is \\\\nabsolutely not needed. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. I thank the gentleman, and I appreciate \\\\nhis work on this bill in particular. The gentlewoman from \\\\nTexas, Ms. Garcia, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all \\\\nthe witnesses who are with us here today. This is, again, a \\\\nvery important topic, especially to someone like me who is from \\\\nHouston. I know that the ranking member has already mentioned \\\\nsome of the disasters and flooding that we have suffered. In \\\\nfact, in 2019, Hurricane Harvey left much of my district \\\\nunderwater and created major, major damages throughout the \\\\nHouston area. Now, years later, many households in Houston have \\\\ndropped their flood insurance for the reasons that the ranking \\\\nmember mentioned, largely due to lack of affordability. Harris \\\\nCounty, which is home to Houston, is projected to see a 75-\\\\npercent increase in the average flood insurance premium.\\\\n    Ms. Lewis, I want to start with you. Given the increasing \\\\nintensity of weather events resulting from climate change, can \\\\nyou speak to the importance of not only reauthorizing the \\\\nNational Flood Insurance Program, which you all raised your \\\\nhand and said you were in favor of, but what more could we do \\\\nthan just reauthorizing it to make it more affordable? You \\\\nmentioned the safety net that we have to worry about. Someone \\\\nmentioned the means test. What is it that we need to do to make \\\\nsure that when we reauthorize it, it is also actually \\\\naffordable, so that we can make sure it is accessible to \\\\neveryone who needs it?\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. Thank you so much for that question. As you can \\\\nprobably glean from my testimony, I am very concerned about \\\\ndiscriminatory practices by the insurance companies. And to me, \\\\nmaking something affordable or more affordable is making \\\\nsomething fair, making sure that the underwriting practices do \\\\nnot penalize people because of what their color is or where \\\\nthey live. It is very important to understand that the \\\\nunderwriting process, since the very beginning of insurance, \\\\nhas always been discriminatory. It has always been these people \\\\nwho live in this certain part of town are going to pay more. \\\\nSo, it is really critical that everything be fair across-the-\\\\nboard, and that you and I should pay the same, if we live in \\\\nthe same area, for flood insurance.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Is there anything that we can do in terms of \\\\nensuring that people who sell the insurance can do it on \\\\npayment plans or any kind of working with the individual based \\\\non their income and then based on the value of their home \\\\nrather than just, this is what it costs, this is what you have \\\\nto pay?\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. I agree, because one of my concerns is that \\\\nthere is no transparency when it comes to the rating structure \\\\nof insurance. I don&#x27;t know if anybody here can tell me how \\\\ntheir insurance premium was promulgated? Can you tell me how \\\\nthey came up with $600 per month or $6,000 per year? I can&#x27;t \\\\nthink of any other industry where they give you a bill, but you \\\\ndon&#x27;t know how that bill was determined.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. We don&#x27;t even know if there are any hidden fees \\\\nthere.\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. Absolutely, because underwriting has always been \\\\nsubjective, and underwriters will determine whether or not you \\\\nget debit or credit based upon what they perceive as a risk. \\\\nAnd it is something that we should all consider nationally, to \\\\nmake insurance fair, and get rid of the subjectiveness. I used \\\\nto sit next to underwriters, and we would have the same risk, \\\\nbut different prices. Why is that so?\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Thank you. Ms. Arnold, I recognize that the \\\\nNational Flood Insurance Program we are talking about is a \\\\nFederal program, but I have concerns similar to that of Ms. \\\\nWaters from California. And Texas has an insurance board. It \\\\nregulates a lot of what the insurance companies do in our \\\\nState, much like I am sure in your State. What is the role of \\\\nthe State in making sure that insurance is affordable?\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Thanks for the question. Our primary role as \\\\nState regulators, our first consumer protection is to make sure \\\\nthat companies can pay claims when you make a claim, and that \\\\ninvolves making sure that there is sufficient capital, and that \\\\nrates are adequate and not excessive. We also look at policies \\\\nto make sure that they comply with State law.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. No, but my question was specifically to make it \\\\naffordable. I know all of you have a lot of regulations.\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Right, yes. And we are also looking to make \\\\nsure that the markets are competitive, which helps with \\\\naffordability because carriers are competing for your business, \\\\nso that is sort of the base of what we do for affordability. \\\\nThe other things that we have been working on, particularly \\\\njust some of the concerns that you have raised, are pre-\\\\ndisaster mitigation. That is making sure that your home or, in \\\\nsome cases, your community, is more resilient to the particular \\\\nperils that are in that community.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentlelady&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Mr. Chairman, I also would like to, at the \\\\nappropriate time--there is a report of some sort, but there is \\\\nno explanation of where it came from. Did everybody get this?\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. We will get an answer for you on that.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. It is basically a point of inquiry, if someone \\\\nwould explain what this is.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. We will get you an answer on that. The \\\\ngentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Flood, is now recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to start \\\\nby highlighting some of the work done by insurance regulators \\\\nin the great State of Nebraska. Nebraska is one of the nation&#x27;s \\\\ntop States for insurance, with domiciles like Berkshire \\\\nHathaway, Pacific Life, and Mutual of Omaha. They are a leader \\\\nin this space, and a big part of that reputation is the \\\\nexperience of the Nebraska Department of Insurance. I know \\\\nfirsthand, from my time in the legislature, that we work hard \\\\nto make policy that keeps premiums affordable in Nebraska. Some \\\\nother States have seen higher premiums, at least in part \\\\nbecause of the restrictions they have put on pricing.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon, can you speak to the challenges that can be \\\\nassociated with States that use preapproval filing systems for \\\\ninsurance? How does that affect things for property casualty \\\\ninsurers in that State?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Sometimes, it varies by State. You can have \\\\ngood States or bad States in either case, but when you have the \\\\npreapprovals, it can often create great delays. For example, in \\\\nCalifornia, the State went for over 30 months without approving \\\\na single private passenger auto rate increase, over 30 months \\\\nin a time of record inflation. You can imagine the kind of \\\\ndevastating losses that causes in the marketplace. You also \\\\nhave, particularly in California, a very antiquated, broken, \\\\n35-year-old system that the Governor and the Commissioner are \\\\nnow trying to address.\\\\n    Every State allows forward-looking catastrophe modeling and \\\\nrate filings except California. Every State allows reinsurance \\\\ncosts to be included in rate filings except California. Every \\\\nState allows consumers the choice to use telematics based on \\\\nactual driving behavior, except California. When you have these \\\\nfactors that essentially constrain innovation, and create long \\\\ndelays, you are going to create a lot more market dysfunction. \\\\nThat is actually why the Florida market originally deteriorated \\\\nso badly. It used to be filled with national carriers. After \\\\nHurricane Andrew, there was a horrible rate suppression, and \\\\nthe number of national carriers in the State plummeted \\\\ndramatically. We have seen some of that in Louisiana, and very \\\\nmuch now in California.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Can you speak, Mr. Gordon, to the challenges \\\\npresented for insurers that have their hands tied regarding \\\\nwhat metrics they can use for underwriting and setting rates? \\\\nSpecifically, I would like you to touch on restrictions related \\\\nto credit rating and location. We are starting to see State \\\\nlegislatures wade into this credit rating business, and I would \\\\nlike you to just comment on that.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Yes. We actually have a couple of studies that \\\\nwe published, one that shows there used to be an enormous \\\\nnumber of drivers in the State residual markets who weren&#x27;t \\\\nable to get regular insurance. But with the advent of credit \\\\nscores, suddenly there was an easy, very affordable tool to get \\\\nthat insurance and those residual market populations plummeted \\\\ndramatically; people got insurance.\\\\n    We also have studies published recently that show a direct \\\\nconnection between credit scores and actual hard braking, hard \\\\nacceleration driving behavior. And we have done recent studies, \\\\nespecially some of our partners at LexisNexis and elsewhere, \\\\nlooking at credit scores, showing that they are, in fact, not \\\\ndiscriminatory, they are not a proxy for race, and they are \\\\nhighly predictive.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. I am going to switch gears for just a moment \\\\nhere. In October, really just a few days ago, we had Insurtech \\\\non the Silicon Prairie, a summit in my home State. The summit \\\\nhad a great turnout with over 400 attendees from 44 States, and \\\\n3 foreign countries.\\\\n    Mr. Nutter, could you speak, and maybe others on the panel \\\\nif so inclined, to the importance of insurance technology and \\\\ninnovation in terms of putting downward pressure on premiums \\\\ngoing forward?\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. There is no question that the incorporation and \\\\nassimilation by the insurance industry of more technology will \\\\nadvance the efficiency, if you will, of rate setting, for both \\\\ninsurance regulators and the industry. It is the broad trend, \\\\nparticularly with artificial intelligence, that will make the \\\\nunderwriting more precise, and then, the rating more equitable.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Would any of the other panelists like to comment \\\\non that?\\\\n    [No response.]\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Seeing none, I guess I have one final question \\\\nhere. In August of this year, the NAIC released a draft \\\\nbulletin on artificial intelligence and predictive models. Ms. \\\\nArnold, could you just comment on your initial reaction to that \\\\nbulletin?\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Thanks for the question. The NAIC has done a \\\\nnumber of things to look at how AI is getting used within the \\\\ninsurance industry. We have an AI principles document that came \\\\nout a couple of years ago that sort of laid out the frameworks. \\\\nWe have also created, which is a letter committee--if you are \\\\naround the NAIC, we name things by letters--our Big Data, \\\\nArtificial Intelligence, and Technology Committee. That \\\\nCommittee&#x27;s entire umbrella is looking at the various issues \\\\nthat arise when there are huge kinds of technologies.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. So, we are looking at it, and----\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Unfortunately, I am out of time, so I will yield \\\\nback.\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. We appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. I appreciate you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. In \\\\nanswer to the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Garcia&#x27;s, inquiry, \\\\nthe slide that was referenced was part of the written testimony \\\\nsubmitted by Mr. Nutter, and it is referenced in the top left \\\\ncorner with the appropriate agency, the reinsurance group that \\\\nhe is part of. So, that is the slide. It is customized for each \\\\nMember&#x27;s district.\\\\n    The gentlewoman from Georgia, Ms. Williams, is now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you, Chairman Davidson, and \\\\nRanking Member Cleaver, and thank you to our witnesses for \\\\njoining us today.\\\\n    Yes, we are once again rapidly approaching a potential \\\\ngovernment shutdown, and it seems like every month in this \\\\nRepublican-controlled House, we are faced with yet another \\\\npreventable crisis after another, putting our national security \\\\nand our economy at risk. Keeping with the theme of my \\\\nRepublican colleagues avoiding problems and, too, they are \\\\nactively harming our constituents, let&#x27;s talk about climate \\\\nchange. Let&#x27;s talk about how it is contributing to the rising \\\\ncost of insurance today. Republicans can&#x27;t even consistently \\\\nagree that humans are impacting our climate, let alone say the \\\\nwords, ``climate change,&#x27;&#x27; but you all live in the real world, \\\\nand I believe in science, and I know that climate change is \\\\nreal and has a real impact on our constituents and on our \\\\neconomy.\\\\n    Ms. Lewis, this hearing is entitled, ``The Factors \\\\nInfluencing the High Cost of Insurance for Consumers.&#x27;&#x27; And as \\\\nyou stated, of course, climate change is a major factor \\\\ninfluencing recent insurance price increases that are burdening \\\\nconsumers, but unfortunately, the Republican memo for this \\\\nhearing doesn&#x27;t even use the phrase, ``climate change,&#x27;&#x27; \\\\nanywhere. Ms. Lewis, do you think it is constructive to have a \\\\nconversation about increasing insurance costs without even \\\\nacknowledging climate change?\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. Absolutely not. You must acknowledge the reality \\\\nof climate change.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. These are policy decisions, and \\\\nwhile my Republican colleagues can act like climate change is \\\\nnot real, people in marginalized communities, myself included, \\\\ndon&#x27;t have that luxury. This past July, I shared with you all \\\\nthat State Farm decided not to renew my homeowners&#x27; insurance \\\\npolicy because I filed a claim after a hailstorm that damaged \\\\nthe roofs throughout my entire neighborhood in southwest \\\\nAtlanta. That was just in March of this year. And even though I \\\\ncan&#x27;t control the weather and you can&#x27;t either, I am now \\\\nconsidered a high risk and have a much more difficult time \\\\nfinding insurance that I can afford, and this is impacting all \\\\nof my neighbors. Low-income Americans are more likely to suffer \\\\nfrom the consequences of flooding, tropical storms, and other \\\\nextreme weather due to inadequate infrastructure in our \\\\nneighborhoods and lack of proper insurance.\\\\n    This summer when this committee decided to launch a full-\\\\nscale attack against ESG, I submitted questions for the record \\\\nto several of our witnesses. Jerry Theodorou, from the R \\\\nInstitute, was kind enough to submit formal responses and let \\\\nme know that a long-term reauthorization of the National Flood \\\\nInsurance Program and some key reforms will contribute \\\\nstability and affordability to the flood insurance market. The \\\\nmultiple short-term extensions of the Program have been a \\\\nsource of destabilizing uncertainty to the market. Now more \\\\nthan ever, with climate change causing more frequent and more \\\\ndamaging flooding, Congress and this committee should be \\\\nworking to reauthorize and strengthen the NFIP.\\\\n    Mr. Webel, can you speak to the consumer benefits of a \\\\nlong-term NFIP reauthorization?\\\\n    Mr. Webel. In general, the insurance markets work better \\\\nwhen they are long-term products. People&#x27;s houses are long-term \\\\nproducts, so I don&#x27;t think there is any question that markets \\\\nwork better.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you. Can you also explain to \\\\nus in detail what the impact of a government shutdown would be \\\\non marginalized communities that rely on the NFIP?\\\\n    Mr. Webel. The shutdown, basically, kind of does two things \\\\nin the sense that what has happened is the authorization of the \\\\nNFIP is technically legally separate from a shutdown, but the \\\\nauthorization has been riding on the appropriations bills. So, \\\\nif an appropriations bill or some other bill that reauthorizes \\\\nthe NFIP is not passed by November 17th, what you have is the \\\\nauthority to issue new flood insurance would go away, and the \\\\nborrowing limit would decrease from more than $30 billion to $1 \\\\nbillion. What that largely means is that people who need to get \\\\nnew flood insurance contracts, who are buying new houses and \\\\nthe like, would not be able to get it from the NFIP. They would \\\\nhave to go to the private market.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Webel. And as if a \\\\nlapse in the NFIP brought on by a government shutdown wasn&#x27;t \\\\nenough, my Republican colleagues are also trying to eliminate \\\\nthe Federal Insurance Office, which, among other duties, is \\\\ntasked with identifying gaps in insurance regulation that pose \\\\nsystemic risk to the market, and monitoring the availability of \\\\naffordable insurance for marginalized communities. In fact, the \\\\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations bill \\\\nthat we are going to be considering on the House Floor just \\\\nnext week, zeros out funding for the FIO entirely. I have \\\\nsubmitted an amendment to reinstate funding for the FIO \\\\nbecause, personally, I believe we should be identifying the \\\\nsystemic risk to the insurance market posed by climate change \\\\nand ensuring that marginalized communities have access to \\\\naffordable insurance.\\\\n    Mr. Webel, can you explain some of the impacts of \\\\neliminating the FIO? I think I am out of time, but I would love \\\\nto have answers to that in writing for the record.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentlewoman&#x27;s time has, in fact, \\\\nexpired. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Lawler, is now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am glad my colleague \\\\ngot all of her talking points in. The only thing she forgot to \\\\nmention was Trump guns, and abortion, and maybe some anti-\\\\nIsrael bigotry for good measure.\\\\n    Historic storms outside of the 100- and 500-year timelines \\\\nhave rocked communities across the country. Earlier this year, \\\\nmy district experienced devastating floods in the Hudson \\\\nValley. Communities hit by natural disasters, like hurricanes, \\\\nwildfires and floods, and climate change, are also confronted \\\\nby the skyrocketing costs of repairs and rehabilitation for \\\\nproperties. And this is only compounded by the day-to-day \\\\ninflation spurred by the reckless spending policies of the \\\\nBiden Administration and the hangover of the COVID economy. Can \\\\nyou describe the challenges that disaster-prone communities \\\\nface in rebuilding such-I&#x27;m sorry, excuse me, it is my time. \\\\nThank you so much.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. We will have order. It is the gentleman \\\\nfrom New York&#x27;s time. The gentleman is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Thank you. Can you describe the challenges that \\\\ndisaster-prone communities face in rebuilding, such as the \\\\ndemand for materials and labor as part of the construction \\\\nsupply chain, and how do you factor these into premiums paid by \\\\nconsumers? This is to the panel.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Congressman, I will just note that while there \\\\nis some variation among States because of higher taxes, in some \\\\nStates, cost of living, but the insurance cost inflation inputs \\\\nof repairing cars, buildings, and people have escalated very \\\\nsignificantly. For example, from the beginning of 2020 through \\\\nthe first half of this year, construction materials have \\\\nincreased 35.5 percent, construction trade services have \\\\nincreased 30 percent, and the overall building replacement \\\\ncosts have increased nearly 45 percent over the last 5 years, \\\\nso there have been very, very significant increases in \\\\nrebuilding costs.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. So, inflation has a tremendous impact on \\\\npremiums?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. That is correct. It is a primary cost driver.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Following up on that, as you know, the National \\\\nFlood Insurance Program faces authorization hurdles at least \\\\nonce every year. Mr. Gordon, your members serve as Write-Your-\\\\nOwns with the National Flood Insurance Program. How does this \\\\nuncertainty impact your business, given the prep work needed to \\\\nhalt and restart a business?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. All of the starts and stops are very \\\\nproblematic and trying to retroactively fix everything. Every \\\\ntime there is a short-term lapse, it always creates additional \\\\ncosts, and additional uncertainty, so we would support the \\\\nlong-term reauthorization of the Program.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Mr. Gordon, many cities in America are facing \\\\nspikes in crime driven by a number of factors, including the \\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and prolonged lockdowns, deep policing \\\\nefforts and the lax prosecution of certain crimes, permissive \\\\ndrug use policies and an increase in drug abuse, and the empty \\\\nstreets created by employees not returning to their offices. \\\\nAccording to the Council on Criminal Justice, there were 33.4 \\\\npercent more motor vehicle thefts during the first half of \\\\n2023, compared to the same period last year. Property thefts \\\\nalso saw a marked increase last year after declining for \\\\ndecades.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon, do new policies that encourage more crime in \\\\nour nation&#x27;s cities make property insurance more or less \\\\nexpensive?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Motor vehicle theft and, in particular, \\\\ncatalytic converter theft, have been skyrocketing, and that is \\\\nvery much another cost driver for auto insurance. On the \\\\ncommercial side, increasing retail theft and crime is creating \\\\ncoverage friction. We had a lot of discussions with our members \\\\nearlier this year about some of the commercial insurance \\\\ntrends. We don&#x27;t see an availability problem at this time, but \\\\nthe coverages have gotten tighter and more expensive.\\\\n    And there is concern not only about the theft losses, and \\\\nthere is a little disagreement over the intensity of that, but \\\\nthe accompanying risk of violence can trigger much more \\\\nexpensive liability lawsuits when people get injured. This is a \\\\npotential trouble spot we are concerned about and are \\\\nmonitoring, and if there is not adequate insurance, not only \\\\nare some of the businesses going to be put at risk, but some of \\\\nthem will have a hard time obtaining financing, which is \\\\nalready a problem for commercial real estate.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Have you seen a lack of willingness to insure \\\\ncommercial properties in high-crime urban areas?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Again, we haven&#x27;t seen availability concerns, \\\\nbut there is some tightening of the coverage, and it is getting \\\\nmore expensive.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. And what is the impact of crime on investment \\\\nand development in our cities if properties become uninsurable?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. It is going to put a lot of businesses at risk, \\\\nand, again, it is going to undermine the ability of those \\\\nbusinesses to get financing, so it is a critical need.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. The \\\\ngentlewoman from Michigan, Ms. Tlaib, is now recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just to be clear, we \\\\nare talking about the cost of insurance going up. Is that auto, \\\\nflood, property? I just want to clear up what this is?\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The focus of the hearing is on property \\\\nand casualty insurance, but to be fair, one of the underlying \\\\nfactors to that is flood. It has been referenced multiple \\\\ntimes.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all \\\\nso much for being here. One of the things I was hoping to talk \\\\nto Mr. Webel about specifically is the fact that some of the \\\\nfactors that the insurance industry uses, to me, are sometimes \\\\nfactors I am not sure what they are taking. Usually, it is the \\\\ncost of the property, right? The value of it, maybe some of the \\\\nother circumstances, it could be theft and things like that. \\\\nAnd some of the factors, for instance, what my residents tell \\\\nme about home insurance is, they ask things that people are \\\\nconfused about, like the use of credit scores to calculate \\\\ninsurance. Is that a practice that is increasing within the \\\\ninsurance industry, that is raising the cost of insurance on \\\\npeople who might be working class?\\\\n    Mr. Webel. I don&#x27;t know that credit score use is \\\\nincreasing. Mr. Gordon might know whether the companies are \\\\nusing them more or less, but that is a factor that is used. \\\\nThat is a factor that generally is overseen by the State \\\\nregulators that need to approve the factors that are being \\\\nused.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. No, I see it in the auto industry a lot where \\\\nnon-driving factors, like marital status and education level \\\\nand people&#x27;s credit scores, are weighed on top of it, and I \\\\nwill give you an example. The University of Michigan did a \\\\nstudy showing specifically that somebody with a DUI, driving \\\\nunder the influence, was paying 3 times less in auto insurance \\\\nrate, his insurance rate, versus somebody who had no DUI but \\\\nhad a lower credit score and was paying 3 times more, even \\\\nthough the other person has a DUI. I am looking at Mr. Gordon. \\\\nDo you have something to say about that?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Yes. Congresswoman, we have some studies we did \\\\nrecently that we would be happy to provide you, which show \\\\nthere is actually a very direct correlation between credit \\\\nscore and driving behavior.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. So, somebody who is poor is not a great driver?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. No. People who are poor do not necessarily have \\\\nlower credit scores.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. They don&#x27;t have access to credit. They pay more.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. No. There are lots of poor people who have good \\\\ncredit scores.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. So, what is the correlation between somebody \\\\nwith a lower credit score? And listen, this impacts all of our \\\\ndistricts, somebody with a lower credit score, how is that a \\\\nfactor in how much their car is valued, how far they drive, and \\\\nin what type of car? I am being serious here. Why does a credit \\\\nscore have to be weighed towards the cost of insurance?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Those are very good questions, and, again, we \\\\nare happy to give you some of our recent studies showing that \\\\nnow that we have telematics, we are actually monitoring direct \\\\nindividual driving behavior, and there is a very high \\\\ncorrelation between people who have lower credit scores, and \\\\nthere are lots of people who are wealthy with bad credit \\\\nscores, and poor people with good ones.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Yes, but the person with the higher credit score \\\\nis paying 3 times less.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. There&#x27;s a very strong correlation between lower \\\\ncredit scores and hard braking and hard acceleration, which are \\\\nshown by telematics to cause more-frequent accidents.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Mr. Gordon, you talked about scrap. Let me tell \\\\nyou, we looked at the scrap metal industry, which a lot of my \\\\ncolleagues actually benefit from. They are a special interest \\\\ngroup, very strong in each State. If we got rid of cash \\\\ntransactions with catalytic converters in the scrap industry, \\\\nbecause it is really hard for our law enforcement and others to \\\\ntrack them down, why aren&#x27;t we moving towards getting rid of \\\\ndirect cash transactions in the scrap metal industry?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. I don&#x27;t know the details on that, but I will \\\\ntell you this is an area for optimism, that a lot of the States \\\\nare making changes on catalytic converters.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. I was trying to get my State to do it.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Yes. It is making a big difference, and we \\\\nencourage the States to do more. We are finally seeing some \\\\nlight at the end of the tunnel in slowing down that catalytic \\\\nconverter theft.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Yes. Ms. Lewis, it has been something of a huge \\\\nissue in the State of Michigan, where I saw in my district \\\\nalone, in Western Wayne, in particular, Dearborn and some other \\\\nareas, where there are high amounts of flooding, there is \\\\nsewage just coming out of people&#x27;s basements, and it is because \\\\nwe had record rainfall. And my local mayors, these folks are \\\\ndifferent political backgrounds, are saying we should start \\\\nlooking at some of those risks and looking at how we support \\\\ncommunities, especially working-class communities, that \\\\nliterally cannot subsidize for the climate risk that again, the \\\\nclimate crisis that we are living in. Can you talk about the \\\\nfact that climate risk----\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. Definitely, I was a personal victim of that in \\\\nDecember of 2022. My basement was flooded with 5 feet of sewage \\\\nand untreated stormwater due to rain, not a flood, but rain. My \\\\ninsurance company declined the coverage because I didn&#x27;t have \\\\nsewage backup coverage, which I didn&#x27;t know I needed. I was \\\\ntechnically homeless for 7 months.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. I am so sorry you went through that, but this \\\\nhas a real-life impact. And Mr. Chairman, I would love to have \\\\nmore conversations about the use of various factors, like \\\\nmarital status, education level, and credit score, in the \\\\ncalculation of insurance rates in our country.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. De La \\\\nCruz, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding \\\\ntoday&#x27;s hearing. Insurance and financial services is something \\\\nnear and dear to my heart, as I have spent over 20 years in \\\\nthis industry. I actually understand, because I have worked in \\\\nthat industry and owned an insurance agency, how marital status \\\\nand credit reporting do affect and can be a factor in what \\\\npeople pay for their insurance costs. That being said, in the \\\\ncounty of Hidalgo, where it is 90-percent Hispanic, we see \\\\nvaried rates, insurance prices based on risk, and let&#x27;s just go \\\\nto the mere definition of, ``insurance.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Gordon, what is the definition of, ``insurance?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Insurance is, again, ultimately providing \\\\nprotection for individuals, protecting them from risk.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. So if there is a higher risk, that means \\\\nthere is a higher premium, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. That is correct, and, in fact, every single \\\\nState prohibits insurance from being, ``unfairly \\\\ndiscriminatory,&#x27;&#x27; and insurers are closely examined on that. \\\\nAnd what, ``unfairly discriminatory,&#x27;&#x27; has always meant is when \\\\nyou don&#x27;t charge based on the risk, so insurers are required \\\\nto, based on individual risk.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. So, it is not based on your ethnicity? It \\\\nis based on your risk?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Correct.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. Okay. What we keep hearing over and over \\\\nagain that has been alluded to was that it is based on \\\\nethnicity. If you are of a minority, in my case, 90 percent \\\\nHispanic, then you just have higher premiums. Would that be a \\\\ncorrect statement?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. No, and the regulators would never allow that. \\\\nWe have actually published very extensive studies that we have \\\\npresented to the regulators on this, examining years of data on \\\\nauto insurance, showing that there is no unfair discrimination. \\\\nIn fact, it really boils down to place, not race. When you have \\\\nurban areas with high traffic density, you have more accidents.\\\\n    There may be some historical racism that has led to \\\\nminority groups disproportionately living in those urban areas, \\\\nbut when you control for the vehicle density in the urban \\\\nareas, most of that disappears. And again, we are heavily \\\\nregulated by the States on this issue and we have reams of data \\\\nshowing that those neighborhoods are not being charged more for \\\\ntheir risk. It is not a racial issue. We are not allowed to use \\\\nrace as a rating factor.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. Wow. What I am hearing is that ethnicity \\\\nhas nothing to do with the rates, that it is about place, not \\\\nrace?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Correct.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. And what I would like to know is, because \\\\nit is about place, not race, that means if you live in an area \\\\nwhere there are high uninsured vehicles, then you are probably \\\\ngoing to pay more for your car insurance than in a place that \\\\nis different?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Correct.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. In Hidalgo County, we are, again, 90-\\\\npercent Hispanic, and we have a large population of automobile \\\\nowners who come from Mexico and do not have insurance. Thus, it \\\\nis not because we are Hispanic that we pay more. It is because \\\\nthere are a high number of vehicles on the roads that do not \\\\nhave insurance. Would that be a fair assessment?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Yes, that is fair. It is accurate. And also, I \\\\nwould note that Texas regulators are also very, very robust \\\\nregulators, and keeping an eye on that.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. State-level regulators, correct? And would \\\\nyou say that the State regulators take pride in their job and \\\\ndo a thorough job?\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. So, they take pride in making sure that the \\\\nState laws are being followed?\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. And those same State regulators would make \\\\nsure that insurance was based on risk and not ethnicity?\\\\n    Ms. Arnold. Correct.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Congresswoman, if I may, this is something the \\\\nState regulators are working on extensively with us. I think \\\\nCommissioner Arnold noted they are working on guidance on AI. \\\\nWe have been having extensive conversations as an industry with \\\\nthe regulators on testing, so there is a lot of oversight and \\\\nwork in this area.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentlewoman&#x27;s time has been yielded \\\\nback. The gentlewoman from Colorado, Ms. Pettersen, is now \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Pettersen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all \\\\nfor being here today. I really appreciate your time and \\\\nexpertise.\\\\n    Ms. Lewis, I wanted to know if you would like to add \\\\nanything to the previous line of questioning? I know you have a \\\\nlot of experience around underwriting and that process around \\\\nrace as a factor in premium costs.\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. Yes, I would like to add that I have never seen \\\\na situation nor have I had my friends who were underwriters not \\\\ntalk about race being a factor when it comes to insurance. And \\\\nI am just very, very concerned with anyone who would think that \\\\nrace is not a factor, because we all know that race is a \\\\nfactor. In the insurance industry, you have underwriters, you \\\\nhave loss control people who are the inspectors, and these \\\\npeople go out and openly talk about those people and how they \\\\nare not going to be insured or how they are going to pay more. \\\\nThe underwriter subjectively debits and increases the cost of \\\\ntheir insurance just because of who they are.\\\\n    I am also very concerned about credit being used to \\\\ndetermine insurance rates because that is not a factor. Credit \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t determine whether or not I am going to get into an \\\\naccident. Credit doesn&#x27;t determine how I drive. What does \\\\ndetermine a lot in urban areas is those people who live in the \\\\nsuburbs, who drive to the city every single day to come to \\\\nwork. Nobody thinks about those statistics. And I would like to \\\\nhave someone tell me, provide a study about all those cars that \\\\ncome into the urban areas, because even though people do drive \\\\ncars in urban areas, most people in urban areas take public \\\\ntransit. Thank you.\\\\n    Ms. Pettersen. Thank you for highlighting that today. I had \\\\nno idea that this was a factor in actually being insured, so I \\\\nreally appreciate that, and I look forward to following up on \\\\nthat.\\\\n    This is a very important hearing for my State, and a \\\\ncritical issue for Colorado. We don&#x27;t even have a wildfire \\\\n``season&#x27;&#x27; anymore; with the changing climate, we are \\\\nconstantly under threat of wildfires. In communities throughout \\\\nmy district, I have people who are reaching out that, \\\\nunfortunately, are unable to buy homes because they can&#x27;t prove \\\\nthat they are able to be insured. We have insurance companies \\\\npulling out of markets because the risk is so unpredictable. \\\\nAnd I guess, more broadly, when I met with people representing \\\\ninsurance companies recently, they talked about how, right now, \\\\nwe are facing kind of a perfect storm.\\\\n    We went through the pandemic. We had the economic fallout \\\\nbecause of the pandemic and because the supply chain was \\\\ndecimated. We had inflation, rising costs, and one of the \\\\nbiggest factors in that is our workforce and inability to hire, \\\\nwhich of course, affects all of us, especially in the \\\\nconstruction industry. Everywhere that I go, no matter who I am \\\\ntalking to, even if it is insurance representatives, we talk \\\\nabout legal pathways and how critical that is to addressing the \\\\nworkforce shortage for our current needs and the future needs \\\\nof our country. We are also facing increased risk because of \\\\nthe climate crisis, and that absolutely affects Colorado. And I \\\\nthink not only about how complicated our current situation is, \\\\nbut what is going to be happening in the future if we don&#x27;t \\\\nwork together to address and help support communities like \\\\nmine.\\\\n    I just want to broadly talk about what we should be \\\\nthinking about in Congress--and I am almost out of time \\\\nalready--about how to address this issue, how to use AI to \\\\nbuild more sustainable, resilient communities and development \\\\nrecommendations, and how we work together to take what we have \\\\nlearned around flood insurance, to bring wildfire insurance to \\\\nhelp support communities, but also learning from the lessons of \\\\nthings that have gone wrong there. I know I am almost out of \\\\ntime, but if anyone would like to comment?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Congresswoman, if I may, just because you \\\\ntouched on one of my favorite passions, which is how important \\\\nAI is going to be to help us solve some of those workforce \\\\nconstraints you are talking about, with fewer and fewer people \\\\nin the workforce trending over time, the only solution for our \\\\nindustry is to use AI, for example, drones after disaster hits, \\\\nto more efficiently and quickly find out where the damages have \\\\noccurred.\\\\n    Now, with a lot of companies, you can use your iPhone to \\\\ntake a picture of your auto accident and send that in, and the \\\\nAI will quickly determine which group of humans needs to make a \\\\nfinal decision, but it helps triage that. We are not going to \\\\nhave enough labor in the future for our insurance needs if we \\\\ndon&#x27;t leverage AI, with appropriate regulator supervision, of \\\\ncourse.\\\\n    Ms. Pettersen. Great. I look forward to a longer \\\\nconversation soon.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentlewoman from Indiana, Mrs. \\\\nHouchin, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you, Chairman Davidson, and Ranking \\\\nMember Cleaver. And thanks to the witnesses for your testimony.\\\\n    As you are all well aware, the insurance industry impacts \\\\nall Americans regardless of income, location, or stage in life. \\\\nFrom first-time homebuyers who want to feel secure in their \\\\npurchase, to empty nesters saving for retirement, to retirees \\\\nthemselves, Americans want options that provide the protection \\\\nthey need while also being affordable and within their means.\\\\n    Under recent stresses in the rise of inflation, it has \\\\nbecome significantly more difficult throughout the country, \\\\nincluding in my district. Recent surveys have found that \\\\nemployers and workers have seen health insurance costs jump 7 \\\\npercent in the last year, car insurance costs jump an average \\\\nof 17 percent nationwide, and homeowners insurance jump 21 \\\\npercent. With inflation taking a toll on Americans&#x27; pocketbooks \\\\nin all sectors, increases in insurance costs have become \\\\nparticularly extreme. So, thank you for coming to talk to us \\\\ntoday about this topic.\\\\n    We know the problem. I would like to focus my limited time \\\\non what Congress can do or specifically should not do in \\\\nresponse to rising costs.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon, you have emphasized the importance of better \\\\nland use planning as a way to reduce the risk and impact of \\\\nnatural disasters such as floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and \\\\nearthquakes on the property and casualty insurance industry. I \\\\nalso understand the current land use planning practices in the \\\\nUnited States are often inadequate, inconsistent, and \\\\nineffective, and have led my constituents in Indiana to \\\\neffectively subsidize those who build dangerously on the coast. \\\\nCould you expand on why land use planning is so crucial for the \\\\nresilience and sustainability of the insurance sector and the \\\\ncommunities it serves? And could you explain why we have gotten \\\\nit so wrong up until this point?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. What we have now seen is the number-one cost \\\\ndriver for the insurance rates has been people moving into \\\\nhigh-climate-risk regions, and sometimes, some of the \\\\ngovernment policies not only subsidize that, but ultimately, \\\\nthey mask the true environmental costs. I think my colleague, \\\\nMr. Nutter, mentioned that we have seen roughly an annual 5 \\\\npercent to 7 percent annual increase in natural disaster \\\\nlosses, largely because of those movements.\\\\n    We are not taking into account when people buy a home, what \\\\nis the long-term cost going to be of insurance living in a \\\\ncoastal area, or living in the wildland urban interface. And \\\\nthen, we are not doing the land use management, things like \\\\ncontrolled burns, like we used to do as a society to make sure \\\\nwe don&#x27;t have more and more wildfires. And we are just now \\\\ndeveloping--and this is really one of the most exciting parts \\\\nof the industry--some very new fire safety standards, how you \\\\nbuild defensive space around your house, and you need \\\\ncommunities to do that to protect each other. There is a lot of \\\\nwork in this area, and there is a lot of opportunity for \\\\npolicymakers to get better building codes, get better land use \\\\nmanagement, and get better mitigation into society.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. And I want to focus specifically \\\\non subsidies as a means to address the issue of rising \\\\ninsurance costs. You discussed in your written testimony the \\\\ndeath spiral that subsidies can create in markets. Do subsidies \\\\ncause rates to increase to rate payers? Could that, in turn, \\\\nresult in more individuals needing to access a subsidy until a \\\\nprivate market is replaced almost entirely by a public or \\\\nlargely subsidized market at a higher and higher cost to other \\\\nrate payers? Is this the death spiral that you discussed?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. That is exactly the death spiral, and, in fact, \\\\nwe saw this in Florida after Hurricane Andrew. They tried rate \\\\nsuppression, and you went from the vast majority, 94 percent, \\\\nof the homeowners&#x27; policies written by national insurers, to, \\\\nafter several years, only 18 percent. Think of how many \\\\nnational carriers abandoned Florida because of the rate \\\\nsuppression.\\\\n    That is what we are seeing in California. California also \\\\nhas a residual market that says all those people who aren&#x27;t \\\\ngetting coverage in the admitted market, go to the residual \\\\nmarket, but the excess losses have to get paid back by the \\\\ninsurers with no recourse. So, it is like musical chairs, where \\\\nthere are fewer and fewer insurers left holding a bigger and \\\\nbigger bag of exposures.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. And, Mr. Nutter, you talked about \\\\nwhat Congress should not do. I appreciate that you clearly \\\\nstate Congress should not create a new Federal property \\\\nreinsurance program to displace the role of States. I agree. \\\\nCan you discuss why it is so important that Congress not create \\\\na new program?\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. Thank you for the question. Effectively, it \\\\nwould put Congress in the business of regulating or managing \\\\nproperty markets at the State level where, in fact, you have \\\\nsuch different State perils, legal environments, and regulatory \\\\nphilosophies, that it really is going to be counterproductive, \\\\nif you will, and concentrates risk such that taxpayers across \\\\nthe country will subsidize high-risk people from low-risk \\\\nareas.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. The gentleman from Nevada, \\\\nMr. Horsford, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you to \\\\nthe chairman and the ranking member. I am glad that we are \\\\nfinally getting back to work here in the House, and I \\\\nappreciate our witnesses for taking the time to be here.\\\\n    We are here to discuss an issue that is undoubtedly \\\\nimportant, and I certainly agree that we should take a serious \\\\nlook at solutions to mitigate the alarming increases recently \\\\nin insurance costs. However, based on the legislation notice \\\\nfor this hearing, I believe that we should be focused on \\\\ndealing with the concurrent and interconnected crises that face \\\\nour Congress today instead of spending our time debating the \\\\nexistence of the Federal Insurance Office. My constituents \\\\ndeserve to have a Congress that works for them, and right now, \\\\nthey are desperate for solutions to the affordable housing \\\\ncrisis that is gripping our State and the nation.\\\\n    During a time of continued elevated housing costs, with the \\\\naverage household spending over 30 percent of their income on \\\\nmortgage or rent, and a shortage of nearly 6.5 million homes, \\\\nthe ability to make ends meet and keep a roof over their heads \\\\nis slipping away from countless families across the country. \\\\nAnd yet, we cannot advance any meaningful housing policy \\\\nbecause we still have had zero hearings on affordable housing \\\\nin this committee this Congress. Now that the House Floor has \\\\nfinally been reopened for legislative business and we are \\\\nfinally able to get back to doing the people&#x27;s work, I hope \\\\nthat this subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Housing, will adopt \\\\na renewed focus on how we can promote sustainable and \\\\naffordable housing for everyone.\\\\n    All of this chaos must be considered within context, and, \\\\nunfortunately, due to the complete paralysis that this House \\\\nfound itself in, we now have only 15 days to avert a needless \\\\ngovernment shutdown. Given what we face as a nation, a shutdown \\\\nat this time should not even be an option, and we are quickly \\\\nrunning out of time to avert yet another crisis.\\\\n    We have continued to see depressed home sales volume this \\\\nyear, and my colleagues&#x27; inability to provide long-term funding \\\\nfor our government agencies will only exacerbate this issue in \\\\nthe communities that cannot afford to lose financing or pay \\\\nfees to push back their closing. If we want to examine factors \\\\nin the high cost of insurance, then we must seriously consider \\\\nthat in the event of a shutdown, property owners could be \\\\nsubject to force-placed insurance policies by their mortgage \\\\nservicers, which has historically been even more costly than \\\\ninsurance obtained in the marketplace.\\\\n    Ms. Lewis, unfortunately, we know that these impacts will \\\\nnot be borne equitably across socioeconomic lines and that \\\\ncommunities of color will inevitably be hit the hardest. Could \\\\nyou explain briefly the longer-term impacts that even a short-\\\\nterm shutdown could have on low- and moderate-income \\\\ncommunities that depend on the National Flood Insurance \\\\nProgram?\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. I will try to explain. I am sorry for my \\\\nhoarseness. Even a short-term delay would affect low-income \\\\ncommunities and communities of color because they don&#x27;t have \\\\nthe reserves to sustain them if they don&#x27;t get immediate \\\\nrelief, and that is a serious problem that is pervasive \\\\nthroughout the entire community.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Thank you. Not only the impacts of a \\\\ncatastrophic lapse, but also the underlying cost will not fall \\\\non all of our communities equally. This, unfortunately, remains \\\\ntrue for the challenges associated with the ever-present \\\\neffects of climate change. While this may be difficult for some \\\\nof my colleagues to admit, we can no longer ignore the \\\\nincreasing frequency and severity of natural disasters. As you \\\\nmay have heard, in a normal year, between 1980 to 2022, the \\\\nUnited States was expected to face approximately 8 disasters \\\\nwith losses exceeding $1 billion. We have already been struck \\\\nby 24 such disasters thus far in 2023 alone, totaling over $67 \\\\nbillion of combined losses.\\\\n    Ms. Lewis, as we continue to see rising insurance rates in \\\\nlight of the increased risk of natural disaster events, Federal \\\\nprograms focused on mitigation are also important. Can you \\\\nexplain the impact to constituents in this regard?\\\\n    Ms. Lewis. Oh definitely, it is important. I think at the \\\\nend of the day, the first thing we should do is eliminate the \\\\nrisk. Stop constructing houses and schools in flood zones. Make \\\\nsure that building codes are up to the standards where they can \\\\nwithstand hurricanes and floods. We aren&#x27;t doing that, and we \\\\nneed to do that.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Thank you for your response. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The gentlewoman from California, Mrs. \\\\nKim, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Thank you, Chairman Davidson, for letting me \\\\nwaive on to this very timely and important hearing, and I want \\\\nto thank our witnesses for being with us today. I represent \\\\nCalifornia, and unfortunately, in my home State of California, \\\\nthere are misguided policies from Sacramento and the State&#x27;s \\\\ninsurance commissioners. Those policies have recently forced \\\\nmajor insurers to exit the California insurance market. As a \\\\nresult, my office has received numerous phone calls and \\\\nmessages saying that the cost of insuring homes is simply \\\\nunbearable and unaffordable. Less competition and less players \\\\nin the insurance market is pushing premiums up and forcing \\\\npeople into California&#x27;s FAIR Plan, which is more costly than \\\\nprivate plans and does not provide comprehensive coverage.\\\\n    Mr. Gordon, I want to ask you about California Insurance \\\\nCommissioner Lara. He said recently that he will continue to \\\\npartner with all those who want to work toward real solutions. \\\\nCan you update the committee on any new agreements made between \\\\nthe State of California and stakeholders since Mr. Lara&#x27;s \\\\nannouncement regarding policy changes to State insurance \\\\npolicy?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. There is a very strong effort by the California \\\\nlegislature to create some fixes, which fell apart at the last \\\\nminute due to their effort to add more mandates and \\\\nprohibitions on nonrenewals. A lot of the problems, frankly, \\\\nare created at the regulatory levels. I mentioned going 30 \\\\nmonths without approving a single private passenger auto rate \\\\nincrease at a time of record inflation. So, I think the \\\\nGovernor and the Commissioner now recognize that there needs to \\\\nbe fixes. They have both committed to doing it, although some \\\\nof those fixes are going to take a while. They are targeting \\\\nthe end of 2024 to get some of those new and improved \\\\nregulations in place, meaning they would take effect in 2025. \\\\nThat is a long time in a deteriorating marketplace to get fixes \\\\nin place.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Yes. You are talking about the 35-year-old \\\\nregulatory framework, right? And obviously, we agree it needs \\\\nto be acted upon and upgraded because my fear is that, since it \\\\nis taking too long, even though Commissioner Lara is saying all \\\\nthese policy recommendations, the next insurance commissioner \\\\ncould rescind policy changes. So, we do agree that there needs \\\\nto be a legislative fix.\\\\n    But another problem that we are seeing in the State of \\\\nCalifornia is the broken FAIR Plan, which, as you mentioned in \\\\nyour testimony, already has a large deficit. Can you describe \\\\nthe FAIR Plan&#x27;s assessment process and how it ultimately \\\\nincreases prices for households who buy insurance in the \\\\nprivate market?\\\\n    Mr. Gordon. Yes. The FAIR Plan is horribly underfunded, as \\\\nmost government programs ultimately tend to be, particularly \\\\nfor insurance. And for any excess losses that the FAIR Plan \\\\nhas, there is a whole layer of assessments that go to private \\\\ninsurers and they are not allowed any mechanism to recoup that. \\\\nThat was something in the legislative process they knew needs \\\\nto be fixed. So, if there is a big wildfire in California, most \\\\nhigh-risk areas are areas with a disproportionate concentration \\\\nof FAIR Plan policyholders, which means the private insurers \\\\nwho haven&#x27;t withdrawn from the market are going to get left \\\\nwith a bigger and bigger tab.\\\\n    And that is spreading those costs because insurers have to \\\\nmake sure they are collecting enough money to cover all of \\\\nthose additional expected liabilities and exposures, so those \\\\nwho are staying in California have to collect more and more for \\\\nthat exposure. That is a ticking time bomb that I know the \\\\nlegislature and the commissioner are hoping to fix.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Thank you for mentioning that because again, I \\\\nrepresent a community that is very wildfire-prone, and we need \\\\nto do something about it. Obviously, California needs to do \\\\nsomething more to mitigate those wildfires with the active \\\\nmanagement tools, so thank you for mentioning that.\\\\n    Mr. Nutter, you said something very interesting in your \\\\noral statement, that insurers are not required to buy \\\\nreinsurance, yet they do it. So why do they do it, and how is \\\\nCalifornia&#x27;s Prop 103 impacting the reinsurance market that we \\\\ntalked about?\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. Yes. Thank you for the question. They buy \\\\nreinsurance largely to manage where they have a significant \\\\nconcentration of upheaval, in your case wildfires, or where the \\\\ncapital support for the company is enhanced by the role that \\\\nreinsurance plays. The issue that I would highlight for Prop \\\\n103 that you are referring to is largely that it has caused the \\\\nInsurance Department not to take into consideration the future \\\\nrisk associated with that and to look at solutions, perhaps \\\\ncommunity-based solutions, that would find both mitigation and \\\\nfinancial recovery as part of that.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Thank you. My time is up.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. The time has expired. Since it is \\\\nprobably his last appearance before our committee, I did want \\\\nto take a moment to acknowledge that Frank Nutter will be \\\\nretiring from RAA on December 31st, after 32 years as \\\\npresident. During his tenure, RAA has grown into the leading \\\\nvoice for the reinsurance industry in the United States, and \\\\nthat is quite an accomplishment for anyone, particularly for \\\\nsomeone from his humble beginnings in West Virginia. But it is \\\\nnot even his most important contribution. Before he came to \\\\nRAA, Frank was also an officer in the United States Navy, and \\\\nserved in Vietnam. Thank you, sir. We applaud you for your \\\\nservice to our country and for your leadership at RAA. We wish \\\\nyou well in your well-earned retirement.\\\\n    Mr. Nutter. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for that. It \\\\nhas always been an honor to appear before the committee today \\\\nand so many other times, and an honor to represent this \\\\nindustry. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Davidson. Thank you. I would like to thank all of \\\\nour witnesses for their testimony today.\\\\n    The Chair notes that some Members may have additional \\\\nquestions for this panel, which they may wish to submit in \\\\nwriting. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open \\\\nfor 5 legislative days for Members to submit written questions \\\\nto these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. \\\\nAlso, without objection, Members will have 5 legislative days \\\\nto submit extraneous materials to the Chair for inclusion in \\\\nthe record.\\\\n    This hearing is now adjourned.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 4:11 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\\\\n\\\\n                            A P P E N D I X\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                            November 2, 2023\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\"", "\"{\\\"link\\\": \\\"https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC73157/text\\\", \\\"date\\\": \\\"07/13/2023\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"OVERSIGHT OF THE PROXY ADVISORY INDUSTRY\\\", \\\"id\\\": 73157, \\\"committee\\\": \\\"Financial Services\\\", \\\"transcript\\\": \\\"[House Hearing, 118 Congress]\\\\n[From the U.S. Government Publishing Office]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                         OVERSIGHT OF THE PROXY\\\\n                           ADVISORY INDUSTRY\\\\n\\\\n=======================================================================\\\\n\\\\n                                HEARING\\\\n\\\\n                               BEFORE THE\\\\n\\\\n                       SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT\\\\n                           AND INVESTIGATIONS\\\\n\\\\n                                 OF THE\\\\n\\\\n                    COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES\\\\n\\\\n                     U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\\\\n\\\\n                    ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEENTH CONGRESS\\\\n\\\\n                             FIRST SESSION\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                             JULY 13, 2023\\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n       Printed for the use of the Committee on Financial Services\\\\n\\\\n                           Serial No. 118-39\\\\n                           \\\\n\\\\n                  [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n                  \\\\n                               __________\\\\n\\\\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE\\\\n                    \\\\n53-378 PDF                WASHINGTON : 2024                     \\\\n                  \\\\n\\\\n                 HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES\\\\n\\\\n               PATRICK McHENRY, North Carolina, Chairman\\\\n\\\\nFRANK D.

Bill Huizenga \\\\n[chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.\\\\n    Members present: Representatives Huizenga, Sessions, \\\\nWagner, Rose, Meuser, Ogles; Green, Horsford, Tlaib, Garcia, \\\\nand Williams of Georgia.\\\\n    Ex officio present: Representative Waters.\\\\n    Also present: Representatives Steil and Sherman.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The Subcommittee on Oversight and \\\\nInvestigations will come to order.\\\\n    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a \\\\nrecess of the subcommittee at any time.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s hearing is entitled, ``Oversight of the Proxy \\\\nAdvisory Industry.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I now recognize myself for 4 minutes to give an opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal, Mr. Friedman, I appreciate you appearing \\\\nbefore the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee this \\\\nafternoon. I believe this is the first time that your firms \\\\nhave testified before our committee, so congratulations.\\\\n    I would like to start by addressing an argument made \\\\nyesterday by some friends on the other side of the aisle that \\\\nRepublicans are interfering with free market principles and \\\\nthat any discussion of ESG--environmental, social, and \\\\ngovernance--is a threat to capitalism. That could not be \\\\nfurther from the truth. We are holding these hearings to, in \\\\nfact, defend capitalism and keep social policies out of the \\\\nboardroom. Social policies should be debated in Congress, which \\\\nwe do often and robustly, and in State capitals, but not \\\\narbitrarily decided by third parties.\\\\n    Now, to the topic at hand. Currently, proxy advisory firms \\\\nplay an outsized role in our capital markets. And as the Biden \\\\nAdministration continues to pursue ESG-related policies through \\\\nregulation and rulemaking, often bypassing Congress, their \\\\ninfluence has grown. Recent data suggests that on average, a \\\\nrecommendation from ISS or Glass Lewis can swing a shareholder \\\\nproposal vote by as much as 30 percent. You are very powerful.\\\\n    Today, you will hear from our witnesses that the proxy \\\\nadvisory industry provides sound independent recommendations to \\\\ninvestors in order to maximize shareholder value. In reality, \\\\nproxy advisory firms have hijacked the shareholder process, \\\\nbecoming the de facto standard setters for corporate governance \\\\npolicies in the United States, and many questions remain.\\\\n    Today, the subcommittee will seek to understand what \\\\nmetrics proxy advisory firms use to measure the impact of \\\\nenvironmental, social, and governance policies, and how they \\\\nmaximize the long-term value. In addition, we will explore \\\\nwhether the proxy advisory firms have sufficient oversight and \\\\ntransparency to give shareholders confidence that the \\\\nrecommendations being provided are actually free from political \\\\nand social influence. Finally, the subcommittee hopes to \\\\nidentify the factors used by the proxy advisory firms when \\\\nmaking voting recommendations.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal, Mr. Friedman, in the past, your firms have \\\\ndeclined to disclose your historical data and how you formulate \\\\nyour voting policies and recommendations. Transparency ensures \\\\naccuracy and accountability. We have to live that every day up \\\\nhere, and that is the only way that your firms can promote a \\\\nfair and reliable proxy process, and, of course, under the \\\\nchairmanship of Gary Gensler, the SEC has injected themselves \\\\ninto the process, which should be a surprise to no one.\\\\n    Recent actions taken by the SEC have made it nearly \\\\nimpossible for companies to defend themselves against ESG \\\\nproposals, which have grown to over 60 percent of all \\\\nshareholder proposals in 2023. The simple truth is this: ISS \\\\nand Glass Lewis seem to bear none of the consequences their \\\\nrecommendations have on companies and, in my opinion, operate \\\\nwithout sufficient transparency.\\\\n    Ultimately, both ISS and Glass Lewis really don&#x27;t answer to \\\\nshareholders or act in a fiduciary manner with a responsibility \\\\nto maximize returns on the investments of retail investors. \\\\nPrioritizing political policies over sound economic analysis \\\\nundermines the fundamental purpose of the proxy voting system.\\\\n    I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today, \\\\nand I yield back the balance of my time.\\\\n    And I will now recognize the ranking member of the \\\\nsubcommittee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 4 \\\\nminutes for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the \\\\nwitnesses for appearing today as well.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, the title of this hearing is, ``Oversight of \\\\nthe Proxy Advisory Industry.&#x27;&#x27; However, I believe a better \\\\ntitle would be, ``Republican Overreach into the Proxy Advisory \\\\nIndustry as a Guise to Promote Climate Change Denial, to \\\\nPromote the End of Diversity and Inclusion Programs, as Well as \\\\nto Promote Overreach Into Corporate Governance.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    By way of example, Republicans are using proxy advisory \\\\noversight as a guise to engage in climate change denial at a \\\\ntime when major insurance companies are leaving Florida and \\\\nCalifornia due to the cost of doing business related to climate \\\\nchange.\\\\n    Oversight is being used as a guise to end lawful, socially-\\\\nacceptable corporate diversity and inclusion programs, as \\\\nevidenced by the fact that my Republican colleagues in \\\\nleadership have ended the Financial Services Committee&#x27;s \\\\nSubcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion at a time when it is \\\\nstill needed to encourage diversity in the financial services \\\\nindustry. This is further evidenced by the fact that my \\\\nRepublican colleagues continue to seat all White males as panel \\\\nwitnesses when there are women and people of color who are \\\\ncapable, competent, and qualified to testify.\\\\n    Oversight of the proxy advisory industry is about an \\\\noverreach into corporate governance to prevent shareholders who \\\\nare owners from having their policy opinions become policy \\\\nafter all shareholder owners have had an opportunity to vote. \\\\nOversight of the proxy advisory industry is little more than \\\\noverreach as a means to hold back valuable climate change \\\\npolicies, roll back diversity and inclusion efforts, and take \\\\nback the right of shareholder owners to have a voice in \\\\ncorporate governance. Sadly, too many of my Republican \\\\ncolleagues are marching to the beat of a rollback, take-back, \\\\ndiscombobulated drummer at a time when our country needs to \\\\nmarch forward. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman yields back. With that, \\\\nthe gentleman from Tennessee, the Vice Chair of the \\\\nsubcommittee, Mr. Rose, is recognized for 1 minute.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you, Chairman Huizenga. Since 2003, \\\\nelements of the Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s regulatory \\\\nregime have acted to entrench investment advisers&#x27; reliance on \\\\nand perhaps even the need for proxy advisory firms. Our \\\\nwitnesses today: Glass Lewis, a for-profit company owned by a \\\\nCanadian private equity firm and a Canadian businessman; and \\\\nISS, a majority German-owned for-profit company, are largely \\\\nunregulated and have significant control over shareholder \\\\nvoting in U.S. capital markets. The rise of proxy advisory \\\\nfirms and the outsized influence they wield have real \\\\nconsequences for investors, the vast majority of whom are \\\\ninterested in maximizing returns, not on identity politics or \\\\nstudying the weather.\\\\n    I am interested in hearing from our witnesses today about \\\\ntheir voting policies and patterns, their conflicts of \\\\ninterest, and whether their recommendations are in the best \\\\ninterests of Main Street investors. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, \\\\nand I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. We will now turn to our witnesses today: \\\\nMr. Steven Friedman, the general counsel at Institutional \\\\nShareholder Services (ISS); Mr. Eric Shostal, the senior vice \\\\npresident of research and engagement at Glass Lewis; and \\\\nProfessor Shivaram Rajgopal, the Kester and Byrnes Professor of \\\\nAccounting and Auditing at Columbia Business School, whom I \\\\nbelieve was in front of our Capital Markets Subcommittee just \\\\nlast year.\\\\n    We thank you for taking the time to be here. You will each \\\\nbe recognized for 5 minutes to give an oral presentation of \\\\nyour testimony, and without objection, your written statements \\\\nwill be made a part of the record.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your \\\\ntestimony.\\\\n\\\\n STATEMENT OF STEVEN FRIEDMAN, GENERAL COUNSEL, INSTITUTIONAL \\\\n                   SHAREHOLDER SERVICES (ISS)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Chairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Green, and \\\\ndistinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the \\\\ninvitation to testify today on behalf of Institutional \\\\nShareholder Services, also known as ISS. My name is Steven \\\\nFriedman, and I am ISS&#x27;s general counsel. I have worked for ISS \\\\nfor nearly 20 years, having originally joined the company in \\\\nSeptember 2003, with a brief break in my tenure in the early \\\\n2010s.\\\\n    Cognizant of the interest this subcommittee has shown on \\\\nthis topic, and also, recently-proposed legislation to reform \\\\nthe proxy advisory industry, I hope my testimony today \\\\ncontributes to a constructive and fact-based discussion about \\\\nproxy advisers by: number one, explaining ISS&#x27;s important, but \\\\nlimited, role in the proxy voting process; number two, \\\\ndescribing how ISS is currently regulated in the United States \\\\nand our responsibilities as a fiduciary to our institutional \\\\ninvestor clients; and number three, conveying the facts about \\\\nthe work that ISS has been privileged to do in serving our \\\\ninstitutional investor clients since our founding over 35 years \\\\nago.\\\\n    Today, ISS is a leading provider of corporate governance \\\\nand investment research, data, and analytics to the financial \\\\nmarket participants around the globe. As was the case in our \\\\nfounding in 1985, proxy advisers remain a market-based solution \\\\nto common proxy voting challenges that are faced by \\\\ninstitutional investors. We have seen market forces at work and \\\\nentrants come and go, including, most recently, the launch of a \\\\nnew proxy advisory service by a self-described anti-ESG asset \\\\nmanagement firm.\\\\n    As part of our core offerings, ISS provides institutional \\\\ninvestors with objective, timely, and expert proxy research and \\\\nvote recommendations based on the proxy voting policies \\\\nselected by the clients. In many cases, our institutional \\\\ninvestor clients develop custom policies that reflect their \\\\nindividual investment objectives and strategies and their own \\\\napproaches to capital stewardship.\\\\n    In fact, during Calendar Year 2022, approximately 80 \\\\npercent of the shares that were processed by ISS on behalf of \\\\nour clients were linked to a client&#x27;s custom policy. For \\\\nclients who choose not to use a custom policy, ISS offers a \\\\nrange of proxy voting policy options, including what we call a \\\\nbenchmark voting policy, as well as a range of specialty voting \\\\npolicies. By offering this range of options, ISS empowers our \\\\nclients to exercise their rights as shareholders in accordance \\\\nwith their own investment parameters and risk return \\\\nassessments.\\\\n    Put simply, ISS and other proxy advisers play an important, \\\\nbut narrow, role in the proxy voting process. It is the client \\\\nwho creates or selects the voting policies and guidelines which \\\\nreflect their own fiduciary obligations and investment \\\\nstrategies. Our job is to synthesize data, analyze proxy \\\\nstatements, and formulate vote recommendations that flow from \\\\nthe client&#x27;s chosen policies and guidelines. Proxy voting is a \\\\nform of investment advice. ISS is a registered investment \\\\nadviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. This statute \\\\nand related rules provide a mature and comprehensive regulatory \\\\nregime that covers virtually every aspect in our business and \\\\nthat effectively addresses transparency, accountability, \\\\naccuracy, and conflict mitigation in the proxy advisory system.\\\\n    Our fiduciary duties follow the contours of our \\\\nrelationship with our clients, so it is important to understand \\\\nwhat those relationships entail and what they don&#x27;t entail. ISS \\\\ndoes not choose the ballot or agenda items upon which we render \\\\nadvice. ISS provides our services only to clients who have \\\\nhired us to do so. And then, we analyze only the companies and \\\\nthe issues that are designated by our clients in accordance \\\\nwith their voting policies and their selected guidelines. The \\\\nvoting decision for each resolution at a company meeting is the \\\\nresponsibility of the company&#x27;s shareholders.\\\\n    Our business model rests on factual accuracy. Our \\\\nincentives are to ensure that our investor clients have access \\\\nto accurate information, and thus, our incentives are aligned \\\\nwith the interests of both institutional investors and the \\\\ncompanies and the issuers that we cover. Our record of accuracy \\\\nis one of which we are proud. The 2016 GAO report concluded \\\\nsimilarly, and the congressional and SEC records are replete \\\\nwith commentary from investors who affirm that conclusion.\\\\n    Our clientele is not monolithic, and accordingly, neither \\\\nare our services. Investors have different investment \\\\nstrategies, risk tolerances, and time horizons. Even when \\\\ninvestors&#x27; ultimate objectives are the same, the investment \\\\nstrategies they pursue to achieve those objectives may differ.\\\\n    And even when they pursue the same investment strategy, \\\\ninvestors often have different views on the relevance of \\\\nspecific information to the risk-return analyses, then \\\\ndifferent ways of assessing how proxy voting serves their \\\\ninvestment goals. This includes the extent to which \\\\nenvironmental, social, or governance factors affect financial \\\\nreturns, and how such considerations align with their \\\\nunderlying goals and mandates.\\\\n    This diverse mix of investment approaches is a hallmark of \\\\nour capital markets and makes them robust. We are proud to \\\\nserve our investor clients in a prudent, open, and honest \\\\nmanner, consistent with our duties. And with that, I thank you \\\\nagain, for the opportunity to testify today.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Friedman can be found on \\\\npage 34 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Thank you. I appreciate that.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your \\\\noral remarks.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF ERIC SHOSTAL, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, RESEARCH AND \\\\n                    ENGAGEMENT, GLASS LEWIS\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Thank you, Chairman Huizenga, Ranking Member \\\\nGreen, and members of the subcommittee. I appreciate the \\\\nopportunity to testify here today on behalf of Glass Lewis. My \\\\nname is Eric Shostal and I am the senior vice president for \\\\nresearch and engagement.\\\\n    Glass Lewis was founded in 2003 to provide competition in \\\\nproxy research in the voting industry. We are proud to have \\\\ngrown to become a company that now serves over 1,300 \\\\ninstitutional investors globally. Glass Lewis is not a \\\\npolitical or an advocacy organization. We are a business that \\\\nhelps our clients, sophisticated institutions that own and \\\\nmanage shares and companies, to make voting decisions in an \\\\nefficient and effective manner. Glass Lewis is committed to \\\\nadhering, at all times, to a high standard associated with our \\\\nfiduciary duty for institutional investor clients.\\\\n    Proxy voting is a means by which shareholders have a say in \\\\nthe companies they own. It is a fundamental, longstanding part \\\\nof the system of corporate law that has served this country so \\\\nwell. No one is required to hire a proxy advisory firm. \\\\nInstitutional investors often do so because it makes more sense \\\\nfor them to outsource the task of reading and analyzing the \\\\nproxy statements of potentially thousands of companies they are \\\\nasked to vote on each year. This, of course, lowers costs, \\\\nwhile allowing them to be prudent stewards and mitigate risks \\\\nto their beneficiaries and clients who may be pension plan \\\\nparticipants or retail investors saving for college or \\\\nretirement.\\\\n    I came to Glass Lewis to lead its research efforts about 3 \\\\nyears ago after spending part of my career as a stewardship \\\\nprofessional on the institutional investor side. Serving as the \\\\nhead of the research team at Glass Lewis has been an \\\\nextraordinary privilege. I work alongside some of the most \\\\nhardworking, experienced, and talented colleagues I have come \\\\nacross in my nearly 20 years in corporate governance, and \\\\nhaving just completed my third proxy season in this role, I am \\\\ntruly in awe of their skill, their work ethic, and their \\\\ndedication to our mission.\\\\n    This past year, I have seen an organized campaign to push \\\\nback on shareholder votes on environmental, social, and, to a \\\\nlesser extent, corporate governance shareholder proposals. And \\\\nto be clear, we do not file shareholder proposals, and we have \\\\nno control over what types of proposals shareholders submit, \\\\nnor do we decide which proposals go to a vote. That is a \\\\nprocess, as you know, that is governed by the SEC, which has \\\\nallowed more, what we call, ``E&amp;S proposals,&#x27;&#x27; onto company \\\\nballots in recent years.\\\\n    Even with this recent increase, however, shareholder \\\\nproposals represent about 1.3 percent of the proposals we \\\\nprovide voting research and analysis on each year. A subset of \\\\nthese relate to E&amp;S issues. In recent years, Glass Lewis \\\\nbenchmark policy has supported about 40 percent to 50 percent \\\\nof such proposals. Why do we support these proposals? We do so \\\\nbecause many of our clients see these issues as material risk \\\\nfactors, factors that need to be considered as a prudent \\\\nfiduciary to mitigate risk and to promote the long-term \\\\neconomic interests of shareholders.\\\\n    As a State treasurer explained at a recent House hearing, \\\\n``This approach is backed by academic research, but it is also \\\\ncommon sense.&#x27;&#x27; Companies that value their workers have less \\\\nturnover and higher productivity. Companies that build strong \\\\ngovernance structures will be more resilient and valuable over \\\\nthe long term. Companies that prepare for changing weather \\\\npatterns and changing market demands will be better protected \\\\nfrom physical and transition risks.\\\\n    Consistent with this, our benchmark policy clearly \\\\nexplains, ``Glass Lewis evaluates all environmental and social \\\\nissues through a lens of long-term shareholder value, not \\\\npolitics, not wokeness, but shareholder value.&#x27;&#x27; Our benchmark \\\\npolicy and our record of recommendations under it are simply \\\\nnot consistent with the claims that we are doing this to \\\\nfurther some environmental or social agenda.\\\\n    At the same time, I do want to emphasize that much of our \\\\ncurrent debate rests on the basic misunderstanding about how \\\\nproxy advisers work and what our benchmark policy is. No Glass \\\\nLewis client is required to vote under our benchmark policy, \\\\nand most, in fact, do not do so. Our benchmark policy is just \\\\none voting option our clients can choose. Because our clients \\\\ndo not all have the same investment strategies or views on \\\\nproxy voting issues, Glass Lewis offers clients a menu of \\\\nvoting options from a climate policy, to a Catholic policy that \\\\nreflects the unique fiduciary responsibilities of the Catholic \\\\ninstitutions, to a corporate governance-focused policy for \\\\nshareholders that are more skeptical of material E&amp;S issues. In \\\\nfact, most of our clients see our custom voting policy that \\\\naligns with their votes and their own views in investment \\\\nstrategies. Our role is to provide objective research to help \\\\nour clients vote as they see fit. We take this responsibility \\\\nvery seriously, and we are proud of the work that we do on \\\\nbehalf of our clients.\\\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today. I \\\\nwould be happy to answer any of your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Shostal can be found on page \\\\n48 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Thank you. I appreciate that.\\\\n    And Professor Rajgopal, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF SHIVARAM RAJGOPAL, ROY BERNARD KESTER AND T.W. \\\\n     BYRNES PROFESSOR OF ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING, COLUMBIA \\\\n             UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Thank you. Thank you to Subcommittee Chair \\\\nHuizenga, Ranking Member Green, and the other members of the \\\\nsubcommittee for the opportunity to testify before you today on \\\\na topic of utmost importance: The state of U.S. corporate \\\\ngovernance and the role that proxy advisers play in that \\\\ndebate. My name is Shiva Rajgopal, and I am the Kester and \\\\nByrnes Professor of Accounting and Auditing at Columbia \\\\nBusiness School. It is an absolute honor and a treat to be \\\\nhere.\\\\n    Virtually every testimony that I have seen and read from \\\\nthe opponents of ESG and proxy advisers appears to assume four \\\\nthings: management always works to maximize shareholder value; \\\\nmanagement&#x27;s decision horizons are perfectly aligned with the \\\\nshareholder&#x27;s investment horizon; management knows who its \\\\nshareholders are and what they actually want; and managerial \\\\naccountability to its capital providers is as good as it can \\\\never be and all is well with the world.\\\\n    Now, I have substantial doubts about each of these \\\\npremises. The state of U.S. corporate governance is not as \\\\nperfect as assumed for several reasons. In any company that \\\\nisn&#x27;t a stock index of note--let&#x27;s say, the S&amp;P 500 or the \\\\nRussell 1000 or 3000--a large portion of the equity is held by \\\\npassive asset managers who may not have the time or the \\\\nincentives to understand the idiosyncratic governance-related \\\\nproblems of each company they vote on. CEO pay, on average, \\\\nstill does not track performance, in my view, despite vigorous \\\\nassertions to the contrary by management.\\\\n    I will just cite three examples. First, most CEO pay in the \\\\nU.S. follows the so-called competitive pay policy model that \\\\ngives CEOs more shares when the stock price is low, and vice \\\\nversa, so that policy severs the link between CEO pay and \\\\nperformance. Second, CEO pay over the tenures is barely \\\\ndifferent for underperforming firms relative to the others. \\\\nFinally, in around a third of the companies that we looked at, \\\\nmanagers got equity at discounted prices even when they \\\\ndestroyed shareholder value. Observable characteristics of \\\\nboards increasingly look homogenous or similar on account of \\\\nregulations, perhaps proxy advisory guidelines, and social \\\\nnorms. What boards actually do in the boardroom is unobservable \\\\nto outsiders, and the consequences of their poor decision-\\\\nmaking may not be obvious for years.\\\\n    So, what is to be done with the topic at hand, proxy \\\\nadvisers? Proxy advisers are certainly not perfect by any \\\\nmeans, so let me start with my concerns. We currently \\\\neffectively have a duopoly of two agencies, and we need to find \\\\nways to get others to enter the space. It is unclear whether \\\\nthey have adequate staff to monitor governance issues or 4,000 \\\\nstocks trading in the U.S. and many more overseas. Whether \\\\ntheir consulting business subsidizes the advice business is \\\\nalso unclear, and for my taste, I think proxy advisers are \\\\nstill more deferential to management than warranted.\\\\n    But having said that, I support some initial regulations, \\\\nsuch as asking them to register with the SEC. Recent SEC \\\\nrulemaking already requires more detailed and standardized \\\\nconflict of interest disclosures for ISS and Glass Lewis. ISS, \\\\nas you heard, is already registered with the SEC, and I believe \\\\nGlass Lewis is not, but I suggest caution beyond that point.\\\\n    If you hobble proxy advisers too much, the feeble health of \\\\nshareholder democracy will simply suffer a body blow. Some \\\\ninstitutions will simply opt out of voting on proxy proposals, \\\\nmaking management even less accountable. This could further \\\\nexacerbate highly-concerning trends in executive compensation, \\\\nwhich proxy advisers, to their credit, have helped to address \\\\nby curbing egregious pay packages and highly-compromised board \\\\nstructures.\\\\n    Hence, I oppose provisions that simply add more costs to \\\\ninstitutional investors monitoring management, including those \\\\nthat ask for an appointment of an ombudsman management suing a \\\\nproxy adviser, singling out ESG funds or ESG proposals for \\\\nspecial punitive treatment, or provisions that make it harder \\\\nto table repeat proposals or those that require advisers to \\\\nseek management input on adviser recommendations. We must \\\\nremember that proxy advisers are paid for by the customers they \\\\nserve: the institutional investors. And as far as I can tell, \\\\nthe paying customers are not the ones asking for more \\\\nregulation of proxy advisers, so enabling and facilitating \\\\nefficient shareholder engagement is a market-based solution to \\\\na market-derived demand for enforcing managerial \\\\naccountability.\\\\n    In closing, I would reiterate that any bill that makes \\\\nproxy advisory services or voting more onerous is a step \\\\nbackward in seeking accountability from corporate managers, \\\\nwhich ultimately, eventually, helps us, the retail investors. A \\\\nreasonable compromise is to take a few regulatory steps in \\\\nterms of registration, and maybe support oversight by the SEC \\\\nand institutional investors to encourage continued improvement \\\\nin the quality and the accountability of proxy advisers.\\\\n    The state of U.S. corporate governance is not as rosy as \\\\noften projected. Anything that interferes with shareholder \\\\ndemocracy obstructs the ability of institutions to seek \\\\ncorporate accountability, which, in turn, hurts the pocketbooks \\\\nof retail investors and retirees investments. Thank you. I am \\\\nlooking forward to answering your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Professor Rajgopal can be found \\\\non page 45 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    We will now turn to Member questions, and the Chair \\\\nrecognizes himself for 5 minutes.\\\\n    I do want to say thanks again to our witnesses for \\\\nappearing here today. I will note to the staff to add, \\\\n``climate denier,&#x27;&#x27; to the list of fantasy accusations. I will \\\\nalso note that I am one of the founding members of the \\\\nConservative Climate Caucus, which is pursuing free market \\\\nsolutions rather than just simply government cudgels to address \\\\nany climate issues.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman, in your testimony you referenced ISS&#x27;s custom \\\\nvoting policies. I would like to better understand ISS&#x27;s \\\\nprocess for customizing these policies. In general, how similar \\\\nare the custom policies to the benchmark policies?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, thank you for that question. The \\\\nanswer is that it really depends on the client and what their \\\\ninterests are, and that really is our focal point.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Are those custom policies similar to \\\\neach other? We are only able to see on your website a few of \\\\nthose policies, and none of them are custom.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Right. The custom policies belong to our \\\\nclients, and they are, as the name implies, customized to them. \\\\nThe range of customization really is a function of how each \\\\nclient looks.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Just help me understand, is there a menu \\\\nof options for investors to choose from? Again, that is not on \\\\nyour website, so obviously, somebody has to contact you.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Sure. And we have folks, a custom analyst \\\\nteam that works with clients to understand where their focal \\\\npoints are. The issues that really get addressed in any policy, \\\\nultimately, are the issues that show up on the ballot.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Okay. I am reminded of the saying of \\\\nHenry Ford regarding the Model T, which is, ``You can have any \\\\ncolor you want as long as it is black.&#x27;&#x27; I guess we are trying \\\\nto understand whether there actually are choices and options in \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal, let me turn to you. In 2022, Glass Lewis based \\\\nits recommendations in part on whether a company is adequately \\\\npursuing, ``broader goals,&#x27;&#x27; defined as, ``net zero emission \\\\ngoals.&#x27;&#x27; What financial or economic analysis did Glass Lewis \\\\nundertake before including this in its recommendations?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Thank you, Chairman Huizinga. If you could \\\\nclarify, is that the statement from our policy?\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Yes, I believe that it is.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. I would clarify that a lot of the discussions \\\\nthat we provide are clarifications in terms of our thinking \\\\naround how a board should be responding to climate risk, and \\\\nreally, we look at kind of a range of options. How does the \\\\nboard oversee climate risk? For example, what sort of goals and \\\\ntarget----\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. So, materiality may not necessarily be \\\\npart of it?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. No, it actually is a part of it, if I may, \\\\nactually, absolutely, it does because one of the points that we \\\\nlook at is, for example, does a company set greenhouse gas \\\\ngoals targets? I think a lot of what we have talked about are \\\\nScope 3 emissions, and there are costs associated with those, \\\\nand we speak to those.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. I am going to move on somewhat, but I \\\\nwould like to talk through a specific example. This year, ISS \\\\nsupported a shareholder proposal that Toyota disclose its \\\\nlobbying related to climate change. This was brought by a \\\\nDanish firm and some other environmental groups out of Europe. \\\\nGlass Lewis did not recommend support for this proposal.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman, can you walk me through very quickly the \\\\neconomic analysis ISS performed to conclude that having Toyota \\\\ndisclose its climate-related lobbying was in the economic \\\\ninterests of the company and its shareholders?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, I am not familiar with the \\\\nparticulars of that example that you are citing, but again----\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. That is fine. That is an acceptable \\\\nanswer.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal, are you able to explain your company&#x27;s \\\\nanalysis in reaching a very different conclusion?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Yes. I think it is quite simple. So many of \\\\nthese issues are governance principles, and when we think about \\\\npolitical spending or lobbying shareholder proposals, it is \\\\nabout good governance. Is the company managing well its \\\\napproach to political spending? We are completely agnostic as \\\\nto how a company spends its money, absolutely, but it is about \\\\ntransparent----\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Was there economic analysis done?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. On a lot of the issues that we provide \\\\nrecommendations on, for example, how many meetings a director \\\\nattends, there may not be an economic analysis.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Coming from Michigan, I know the car \\\\nindustry pretty well, and there is a huge debate within the \\\\nauto industry about hybrids versus electric vehicles (EVs). And \\\\nmany people believe that Toyota--this was viewed as a \\\\npunishment for them not being aggressive enough in EVs because \\\\nthey believe strongly in hybrid, and they believe that is \\\\nactually the wave of the future. Again, I am concerned that the \\\\neconomic analysis of this is where we are losing so much of the \\\\nimpact of where this is going and these types of things that \\\\nlead many of us to conclude that it is political policy or \\\\nsocial policy that drives it rather than economic analysis.\\\\n    My time has expired. With that, per his tradition, the \\\\nranking member will pass his initial time off to the gentleman \\\\nfrom Nevada, Mr. Horsford, who is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the \\\\nranking member. I would just argue that social policy is \\\\neconomic policy. It is a business imperative. It is a reality. \\\\nWe are sitting here having a hearing, and it is a hearing on \\\\nenvironmental sustainable governance, but it is really about \\\\nanti-ESG. And I just really find it astounding that this is \\\\nwhat we are spending our time on as a committee, when our \\\\nconstituents want to know about so many other important issues \\\\nthat we are not addressing.\\\\n    The rights of shareholders to take a vested interest in the \\\\ncompanies they invest in are intrinsic to the idea of partial \\\\nownership. If we are going to begin to limit the ability of \\\\nshareholders to affect the corporations they own, then are they \\\\ntruly owners? During the shareholder voting season, investors \\\\nshould be able to focus on whatever values they decide. I don&#x27;t \\\\nbelieve that these proxy advisory firms are handing down edicts \\\\nfrom on high, and, frankly, I don&#x27;t believe the government \\\\nshould be either. If the shareholder believes the value set is \\\\ncrucial to the financial health of their company, then why \\\\nshould we prevent them from obtaining that information?\\\\n    Those types of short-sighted attempts to limit disclosures \\\\nwill actually prevent investors from making informed decisions, \\\\neconomic decisions, business-imperative decisions. One of the \\\\nstarkest examples of information with a direct relationship to \\\\nrisk turns on equity is a company&#x27;s diversity. Every day, our \\\\ncountry grows more diverse, and it is about time that the C-\\\\nsuites and our boardrooms in corporate America caught up to the \\\\ncountry with which they hope to conduct business. I would say \\\\nthat this is a noble goal in its own right. It is also simply \\\\ngood business.\\\\n    I have worked with corporate America on diversity/equity \\\\ninitiatives promoting workforce. I ran the largest job training \\\\nprogram in the State of Nevada for 10 years before I came to \\\\nCongress, in partnership with all the major hotels in Las Vegas \\\\nand the biggest union. I know the importance of diversity. It \\\\nis a strength.\\\\n    And yet this Congress, led by Speaker McCarthy and those on \\\\nthe other side, are choosing to use it as a wedge issue and not \\\\nan asset. When businesses all across the country were suffering \\\\nduring the pandemic, the research institute, BoardReady, found \\\\nthat companies with diverse boards grew by 4 percent. Unlike \\\\nevery other cohort that could be assembled, these companies \\\\nactually came out of that turbulent time stronger than before.\\\\n    Professor Rajgopal, I would like to take a moment to \\\\nexamine the link between diversity, equity, and inclusion \\\\nefforts and financial performance. In your experience, do you \\\\nthink that these companies are stronger because they have \\\\ndiverse leadership, or do you think these strong companies have \\\\ndiverse leadership because they understand the financial \\\\nbenefits of expanding the lived experience of their C-suites?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Congressman, the way the----\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Rather quickly, because I only get a few \\\\nminutes every time I am on this panel.\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Yes. I would say yes, and the link is through \\\\ncorporate culture, and corporate culture has been shown to \\\\naffect all kinds of good things about a company: innovation, \\\\nproductivity, compliance, ethical behavior, and performance in \\\\ngeneral.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. For investors, does that distinction matter?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Certainly, it does. The state of corporate \\\\nculture is probably one of the biggest unrecognized off-balance \\\\nsheet assets, I would say.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. And why would it be material to an asset \\\\nmanager to examine the human capital of a company prior to \\\\ninvesting in them?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. I know several hedge funds that actually make \\\\na lot of money filtering on corporate culture, so clearly, it \\\\nis material to at least those hedge funds.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Mr. Friedman, does ISS make the final \\\\ndecision on how a shareholder votes on a proposal, or are your \\\\nrecommendations nonbinding?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. They are. The clients control their vote.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Could you discuss in depth how investors are \\\\neven able to tailor the recommendations they receive from your \\\\nbenchmark policy?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Yes. Congressman, thank you. Conceptually, \\\\nthe ability to customize, to take a view on any particular \\\\nissue that shows up on the ballot, really is the free choice of \\\\nthe client, and they can look at issues such as----\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Free choice of the client, of the investor, \\\\nor of the shareholder?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. And we are having a hearing that would do \\\\nwhat? Attempt to take that free choice away from the party that \\\\nclaims to be a ballot free to vote.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Sessions, \\\\nis recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and to our \\\\nwitnesses, I want to thank you for taking the time to be with \\\\nus here today.\\\\n    I would like to reference back to yesterday, to a hearing \\\\nof the full Financial Services Committee, where Ted Allen, the \\\\nvice president of policy and advocacy for the Society of \\\\nCorporate Governance, stated that the Society conducted a \\\\nmember survey in 2019 and found that 42 percent of its members \\\\nreported or noticed errors in the research of the proxy firms \\\\nthat served those companies. What would each of you say to \\\\nthat?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Thank you, Congressman, for the question.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Yes, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. I would say that I am not familiar with that \\\\nparticular study, but I can say that the statistic that was \\\\ncited does not reconcile with the work and the assessments we \\\\ndo, because we do look at errors. As I said earlier, what is \\\\ncritical is getting it right. That is what our clients who \\\\nare----\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. So it is not material to you, sir?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Thank you for the question, Mr. Sessions. I am \\\\nactually struck by that because we are actually members of the \\\\nSociety of Corporate Governance, and as you know, we welcome \\\\nengagement with them, so we would be very happy to hear more \\\\nabout that. And I would say that it is actually not consistent \\\\nat all with what we are considering----\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Not consistent with your----\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. With what we are hearing back from the \\\\ncorporates. We engage with over 1,000 corporates a year, and we \\\\ndo not get that level of feedback.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Thank you.\\\\n    Professor, do you have a feeling about this statement?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Yes. In my experience, it is probably a \\\\nhandful, less than 1 percent. Are these errors or are these \\\\ndifferences of opinion?\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Thank you. The first two gentlemen, please, \\\\nwho represent companies, are your results audited by any \\\\noutside firms?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. The results of the reports themselves?\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Your work.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. There is not an audit of our proxy research--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. So, no outside firm audits your work?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. That is correct, not in the traditional sense \\\\nwhen you do have, what we call it a----\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Let the record reflect that there is no audit \\\\nof your work, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. On an individual basis, as you know, the \\\\nseason is so compressed, it would be nearly unworkable to audit \\\\nevery proxy paper. But I will say that we are members of the \\\\nBest Practice Principles----\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. I&#x27;m sorry. If you can go back just for a \\\\nsecond?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. I&#x27;m sorry?\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Go back. Your microphone cracked for a \\\\nminute. If you could please say that again. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. It would be unworkable to review every single \\\\nproxy paper, given the condensed proxy season. As you know, \\\\nover 3 months, we have to evaluate about 4,000 companies. But I \\\\nwould say that we are audited in the context that we are \\\\nmembers of the Best Practice Principles for Shareholder Voting \\\\nResearch, so there is an independent oversight in----\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. I am in no way offering any observations \\\\nabout it. I just simply ask questions, and your response that \\\\nyou have given me, both of you, is that neither of your firms \\\\nare audited by any outside firm. I would like to say that you \\\\nbeing here today is important for us to ask questions, and I \\\\nappreciate the chairman for bringing you here. But I think that \\\\nthe sensitivity related to these--I am going to send you both a \\\\ncopy of the presentations that were made yesterday so that it \\\\nwill allow you an opportunity to see what this committee has \\\\nbeen told and provided, which would include amounts of times \\\\nand numbers of people who provide feedback on proxies, and I \\\\nthink that it is very important for us to pay attention.\\\\n    This is voting is what it is, and it is corporate \\\\ngovernance at its very essence. And I am delighted that our \\\\nyoung chairman has taken the time to have you here today. I \\\\nwill send you a letter in the next week or so, and I would ask \\\\nthat you respond back to it on your viewpoints about the \\\\nfindings that we were provided yesterday.\\\\n    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Will the gentleman yield?\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. I will yield.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Briefly. Okay. I appreciate that. I did \\\\nhave one other quick example; I cut myself off with my time \\\\nwhen we were talking about Toyota, but we have also seen \\\\nsimilar conflicts between Glass Lewis and ISS regarding \\\\nshareholder proposals at Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, \\\\nPhillips 66, and Equinor, and that is the type of thing we need \\\\nto dig into.\\\\n    The time has expired. And with that, the Chair recognizes \\\\nthe ranking member of the full Financial Services Committee, \\\\nthe gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. Professor Rajgopal, it has \\\\nbeen suggested that proxy advisers are puppet masters \\\\ncontrolling how asset managers or institutional investors vote \\\\nthe shares. It has also been suggested that proxy advisers have \\\\nundue influence on shareholder engagement. What are your views \\\\non this? Are the investor clients or proxy advisers required to \\\\nfollow proxy adviser recommendations?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. No, because in my experience, most of the big \\\\ninstitutional investors, and even the medium-sized ones, have \\\\ntheir own research teams. So, they probably use input that \\\\nthese two gentlemen&#x27;s firms give them, but they don&#x27;t \\\\nnecessarily mechanically follow some of that work.\\\\n    And if I may, I think there is an issue with correlation \\\\nand causation. Let&#x27;s say you are a doctor and you think I \\\\nshould lose weight, and you think this based on blood tests and \\\\nwhatever. I know what I eat, and I know I don&#x27;t exercise, and I \\\\nknow I need to lose weight. Is that mechanical voting? So, if \\\\nyou just look at the data, it looks like you are asking me to \\\\nlose weight, and I have come to the conclusion that I should \\\\nlose weight, but this is just correlation; it may not be \\\\ncausation.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. You and I discussed this \\\\nyesterday at the roundtable I held, and I want to visit this \\\\nissue again for the record. As you know, the SEC&#x27;s proposed \\\\nclimate risk disclosure rule applies to only publicly-listed \\\\ncompanies. Would you comment on the benefits of extending these \\\\ndisclosure requirements to other similarly-situated companies, \\\\nlike privately-held operating companies or companies that are \\\\nowned by private equity firms? How would such disclosure inform \\\\nand benefit the investors in those companies?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. If high-emission companies are seen as bad by \\\\npublic investors, this opens up, as we discussed in the \\\\ntechnical jargon, a market for arbitrage. These assets \\\\neffectively get sold to private owners, and then, they \\\\neffectively escape the reporting system. We do have the EPA, \\\\nwhich does a little bit along these dimensions, but not enough.\\\\n    And if I may talk a little bit about private equity in \\\\ngeneral, there is good private equity and there is bad private \\\\nequity. Good private equity makes money by squeezing out \\\\noperational efficiencies, and that is fantastic. We want good \\\\nallocation of resources. Bad private equity makes money by \\\\nsocializing costs--financial engineering, sale, lease backs, \\\\ndividend recaps--and we need to know which is which. And right \\\\nnow, we have none of that information, because this is \\\\ncompletely opaque, so some disclosure would help.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you. I would like to end my questions by \\\\nasking you to discuss the benefits of competition in our \\\\ncapital markets and the need to mitigate or eliminate conflicts \\\\nof interest. Some have argued that we need more perspectives on \\\\nproxy votes, that the proxy advisory industry isn&#x27;t \\\\nsufficiently competitive, and that there are some needed fixes \\\\nto ensure conflicts of interests are mitigated when proxy \\\\nadvisory firms offer consultant services to corporate \\\\nmanagement. Are these real risks?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. I haven&#x27;t seen the financial statements, so I \\\\ndon&#x27;t know whether the conflict of interest issue is real or \\\\nnot, but we have historical precedent. Let&#x27;s not forget the \\\\naudit industry, remember under Sarbanes-Oxley, was actually \\\\nrequired to decouple consulting and auditing. So, it is \\\\ntheoretically possible, hence, my statement earlier that we \\\\nshould probably look for some disclosures along those line.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Are reforms needed in this space?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Say it again?\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Reforms, are they needed?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Yes. I think the Clayton SEC did put in \\\\nsomething about standardized conflict-of-interest rules, so \\\\nmaybe we should look at those disclosures. Maybe that is enough \\\\nfor now, but at least we need to have a conversation about that \\\\nfor sure, yes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. I guess further, how do we ensure that we don&#x27;t \\\\nbreak what is working for our markets?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. No, I agree. Hence, I said that the state of \\\\nU.S. governance is not as rosy as it looks, and you might \\\\neffectively cut off your nose to spite your face. The bigger \\\\nproblem is the state of corporate accountability. We can fix \\\\nproxy advisers here and there, tweak a little bit, but let&#x27;s \\\\nnot forget the bigger issue. This should be a hearing about the \\\\nstate of U.S. corporate governance, in my view.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentlelady yields back. The \\\\ngentlewoman from Missouri, Mrs. Wagner, who is also the Chair \\\\nof our Capital Markets Subcommittee, is recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Mr. Chairman, \\\\nmuch like you did, I would like to start part of my questioning \\\\nby setting the record straight. We have heard many, many \\\\nerroneous accusations over the past 2 days from my friends on \\\\nthe other side of the aisle that we are somehow seeking to \\\\nthwart the free market and upend capitalism. That is \\\\ncategorically false, Mr. Chairman. What we are seeking is more \\\\naccountability and transparency in the proxy process by the \\\\nduopoly of proxy advisory firms testifying before us today.\\\\n    It was, I will remind everyone, a Republican President, \\\\nTeddy Roosevelt, who was made famous from trust busting, so it \\\\nis definitely in line with free market capitalism to stop \\\\nmonopolies and duopolies created by the administrative state. \\\\nAs one of our witnesses in yesterday&#x27;s hearing, Mr. Zycher, I \\\\nthink, so eloquently stated, ``The issue is whether regulatory \\\\nagencies should be creating conditions in which they are forced \\\\nto accept the recommendation of proxy advisory firms. The SEC \\\\nhas promulgated regulations, which has led to an environment in \\\\nwhich firms are forced to use proxy advisers, they are forced \\\\nto adopt the recommendations of proxy advisers, and proxy \\\\nadvisers have no responsibilities in a fiduciary sense.&#x27;&#x27; This, \\\\nMr. Chairman, is a question that this committee must consider.\\\\n    Now, my question is to Mr. Shostal. After looking through \\\\nyour website, it is difficult to tell how Glass Lewis develops \\\\nits policies and procedures to formulate its voting guidelines. \\\\nIs there a particular reason why your firm does not disclose \\\\nyour historical recommendation data or how you formulate voting \\\\npolicies? What engagement does Glass Lewis undertake with \\\\ncompanies that are the subject of its proxy voting \\\\nrecommendations?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Thank you for your question. I appreciate it. \\\\nWe could talk for 10 minutes about this. I will try to be \\\\nefficient.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. We do not have that, so quickly?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Exactly. We will rappel our transparency \\\\naround our process for voting guidelines first. We have, first \\\\nof all, 43 regional voting guidelines globally to reflect----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. You have no historical data, sir. None. You \\\\ndon&#x27;t talk about how you formulate your policies.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Actually, I will correct the record that we \\\\ndo, and we provide seasoned reviews. The team is now creating \\\\nseasoned reviews for the U.S. market, and there are historical \\\\ndata points on how we voted and how the market responded in \\\\nterms of shareholder results.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. But it is not how you got your recommendation \\\\nof your data. How do you engage with the subject of your proxy \\\\nvoting recommendations?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. The data is available for our clients who \\\\nchoose to procure it, but we aggregate it because our clients \\\\nwant to know what the voting trends are, and I would be happy \\\\nto share it with the subcommittee.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Okay. Moving on, Mr. Friedman, ISS conducted \\\\nclimate surveys of institutional and corporate use issuers in \\\\nboth 2021 and 2022. Those surveys yielded a total of 329 \\\\nrespondents and 417 respondents, respectively. There are over \\\\n4,000 issuers in the United States. Do you believe that the few \\\\nhundred respondents to your survey represents a meaningful \\\\namount of data to develop your voting guidelines?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congresswoman, the process by which we \\\\ndevelop our policies and those guidelines really is open and \\\\ninclusive. We do make that survey as well.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. But it is very miniscule, sir, very small, \\\\nbecause it seems to me that you are not collecting nearly \\\\nenough input or information. Tell me, how does ISS formulate \\\\nthe survey questions it asks?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. First of all, we are looking at what new \\\\nissues may be coming up in the market in terms of new corporate \\\\ngovernance issues or issues that may show up on the ballot in \\\\nthe next season. To get an understanding of how the market as a \\\\nwhole, are institutional investors----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Okay. What engagement does ISS undertake with \\\\ncompanies that are the subject of its proxy voting \\\\nrecommendations?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. We have processes to engage with corporations \\\\nboth during season and outside of season, and our research \\\\nteam----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Well, they don&#x27;t think so. From what I can \\\\ntell, ISS&#x27;s website tells companies to engage through its, \\\\n``Help Center.&#x27;&#x27; What type of engagements take place with the \\\\ncompanies and shareholder activists----\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Again, the process, Congresswoman----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. ----through the Help Center on a website that \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t even have data on it? Your own website tells companies \\\\nto engage through your Help Center. Do you ever proactively \\\\nreach out to companies to better understand the impact of \\\\nshareholder proposals prior to making recommendations, or does \\\\nit only use publicly-available information, for instance, that \\\\nis available on the company&#x27;s website?\\\\n    Now, I am out of time. I would like that question answered, \\\\nand I would like my prior questions answered, and I have more \\\\nto submit for the record, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Thank you. The gentlelady can submit \\\\nthat to the Chair, which we will pass along, and we anticipate \\\\ntimely responses to that.\\\\n    The gentlelady from Michigan, Ms. Tlaib, is now recognized \\\\nfor 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Thank you so much. Any time two firms control \\\\nmore than 90 percent of a market, concern is entirely \\\\nappropriate. We know that, but I do believe that targeted \\\\nreforms are necessary. But I want to talk about some of the \\\\nconcerns that get raised around the burden of shareholder \\\\nproposals on public companies. And so, to each witness, how \\\\nmany shareholder proposals do most companies receive annually? \\\\nI will start with you, Mr. Friedman.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Yes. Congresswoman, I apologize, I don&#x27;t have \\\\nthe exact number, but as I know Mr. Shostal mentioned in his \\\\nopening testimony, the percentage of shareholder proposals as a \\\\nfunction or as a percentage of the total number of ballot items \\\\nthat show up is extremely tiny. The bulk of the----\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Yes. As of 2019, most companies haven&#x27;t received \\\\nany shareholder proposals in a given year. Is that right, \\\\nProfessor? If a company does receive a shareholder proposal, \\\\nhow many do they normally receive?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Yes. Some old data maybe, but it gives you an \\\\nindication, I think 13 percent of the Russell 3000 companies \\\\ngot a proposal. That is once in 8 years, right, 1 divided by \\\\npoint-13. A lot of this relates to the very large caps, the \\\\nAmazons, and the Microsofts, and the Teslas. If you look at the \\\\nwhole gamut, it is pretty smart.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. How often are shareholder proposals binding on a \\\\ncompany? Does anybody know that?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Binding?\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Binding.\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Nothing is binding.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. It is completely advisory.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Now, I want to talk about some of the benefits \\\\nthat have resulted from shareholder proposals. In many cases, \\\\nshareholder proposals have helped establish what are now \\\\nconsidered industry best practices, such as independent board \\\\nleadership and annual elections for other directors.\\\\n    Professor, can you discuss some of the policies that are \\\\ntoday viewed as best practices, that were initially driven by \\\\nshareholder proposals?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Annual voting of directors, splitting the \\\\nboard, Chair of the board, and the CEO, which is still highly \\\\ncontentious, comes up every year in most companies and doesn&#x27;t \\\\npass, and eventually, hopefully, will at some point. There are \\\\nmany, many, many, many proposals. For example, Wells Fargo, \\\\nthat is a classic case study. Actually, I think it was a New \\\\nYork pension fund. That said, we should have a clawback for all \\\\nkinds of problems with Wells Fargo. Eventually, Wells Fargo \\\\nblew up, so the idea that this was complete, nice, is, I think, \\\\noverstated.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Absolutely. Mr. Friedman, you touched on in your \\\\ntestimony, am I correct, that in an overwhelming majority of \\\\ncases, your company&#x27;s vote recommendations are based on your \\\\nclients&#x27; voting policies?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Yes, that the overwhelming majority of votes \\\\nare tied to a client custom policy as opposed to an ISS \\\\nproprietary policy. That is correct.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Yes. Again, there are constant concerns, and \\\\nwhat I am hearing is mind-boggling. You all are doing advisory \\\\nwork, but somehow you decide how their clients vote.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal, is it correct that your clients choose their \\\\nproxy voting policy, including possibly their own custom voting \\\\npolicies that you then use to make your voting recommendation, \\\\nsir?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Yes, absolutely. In our experience, a vast \\\\nmajority of our clients select a custom voting policy.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Moving beyond the content of specific \\\\nrecommendations, whether or not a client of a proxy adviser \\\\nactually follows the adviser&#x27;s recommendation and another \\\\nmatter entirely, Mr. Friedman, Mr. Shostal, do your clients \\\\nhave to follow your recommendations?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. No, they do not.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. That is right.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. No, they do not.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. How often do your clients follow through with \\\\nany of your recommendations? Is it simply automatic?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. It is not simply automatic, and, again, \\\\nrecognizing that the bulk of the shares are tied to a custom \\\\npolicy which the client has chosen. And even if it is an ISS \\\\nproprietary client policy that they have chosen, we would \\\\nexpect, generally, some alignment there. But they are not \\\\nobligated to, and there are certainly cases where they do \\\\ndiverge.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Professor, what do you think this hearing is \\\\nreally about? You can tell us. Go ahead.\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. To me, it should be about the state of U.S. \\\\ncorporate governance, and proxy advisers, as I said, are not \\\\nperfect.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. No. What do you think they are afraid of here, \\\\nshareholders that have information?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. The obvious answer is to go private.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. No, seriously, does anybody have any idea why? \\\\nWe are guessing here. I am really taken aback. There are no \\\\ntargeted reforms. There is no discussion as if shareholders \\\\ndon&#x27;t deserve information and guidance, and I don&#x27;t understand \\\\nwhat is going on here. Does anybody?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. If the contract is, give me your money and go \\\\naway, that doesn&#x27;t work here.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. It&#x27;s the same thing with tenants, ``Give us your \\\\nrent, and we don&#x27;t care about the condition of the place.&#x27;&#x27; It \\\\nis just absolutely mind-boggling. It really is. I am really \\\\ndisappointed that we are doing this. Thank you all for your \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Just for informational purposes, this \\\\nmorning&#x27;s hearing listed 20-some items of bills that were being \\\\nexplored regarding this issue.\\\\n    The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Rose, is now recognized \\\\nfor 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I would \\\\nlike to submit an article for the record written by Mr. \\\\nRajagopal expressing support for increased oversight of proxy \\\\nadvisory firms, including SEC registration and disclosure of \\\\nconflicts of interest.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Mr. Friedman, and Mr. Shostal, yes or no, do you \\\\nagree with Mr. Rajgopal that you should register with the SEC \\\\nand disclose conflicts of interest?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Proxy advice is already regulated by the SEC, \\\\nand we, on a global basis, have a range of policies from \\\\nconflicts practices.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. I will take that as a, ``yes,&#x27;&#x27; as well. Mr. \\\\nFriedman, I would like to discuss ISS&#x27;s board-aligned voting \\\\npolicy. I find its name strange, considering that the policy is \\\\nnot truly a vote with the board policy. The policy will only \\\\ndefer to the board on specific proposals so long as the board&#x27;s \\\\nposition supports what ISS perceives to be, ``adequate,&#x27;&#x27; ESG \\\\ndisclosure.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman, what metrics are used by ISS to determine \\\\nwhether an ESG proposal is adequate, and what is ISS&#x27;s \\\\ndefinition of, ``adequate?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, the framework that we use, \\\\nagain, and that borderline policy is one, and it is not \\\\nintended to be and I don&#x27;t think has been presented as one, \\\\nthat it will vote or support every single management \\\\nresolution. I think, frankly, if that was an approach that a \\\\nclient of ours wanted, which they certainly would be free to \\\\ntake, we probably would need a distinct policy. But we are \\\\nlooking at the facts and circumstances of every resolution that \\\\nshows up on the ballot and whether it is the borderline policy \\\\nor any of the other policies that we are applying on behalf of \\\\nthe client. The factors are laid out in those policies, and we \\\\napply those factors to the facts at hand, recognizing that \\\\nevery proposal is different, every company is different, and \\\\nreach your recommendation on that basis.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Okay. Mr. Friedman, ISS&#x27;s board-aligned policy \\\\nguidelines state that it is focused on the, ``creation and \\\\npreservation of economic value.&#x27;&#x27; Shouldn&#x27;t all policies for \\\\ninstitutional investors be focused on this?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Yes, and I believe that the policies are, but \\\\nI do think there can be a divergence of views amongst \\\\ninvestors, for a range of reasons, because of their own \\\\ninvestment strategies, time horizons, things that they think \\\\nare more or less important, that reasonable minds can disagree \\\\nwhen they make these assessment, and so that is the value. And \\\\nin our experience, our clients who are institutional investors, \\\\nsophisticated, who themselves have fiduciary duties, I think \\\\nthey are investing for value and voting based on value, but \\\\nwith recognizing how they assess it and think about it. There \\\\nis a diversity of thought there.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. And just to reiterate something you said there, \\\\nyour customers are institutional investors. Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Okay. Shifting to you, Mr. Shostal, why did Glass \\\\nLewis create the governance-focused policy?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. From our client feedback. In fact, it was \\\\ndeveloped with a number of red State pension funds when they, \\\\naround pecuniary issues, surfaced in the last 12 months. They \\\\ngave us feedback. We implemented a policy that they could start \\\\nusing and then further customize. It was a starting point so \\\\nthat a number of red States could leverage this thematic \\\\npolicy.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Okay. And, Mr. Friedman and Mr. Shostal, for both \\\\nof you, yes or no, doesn&#x27;t the existence of these other \\\\npolicies call into question the objectivity of the benchmark \\\\npolicies?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. I would love to get more context, but the \\\\nsimple answer is, no, it does not.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Could you repeat the question, please?\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Does the existence of these other policies call \\\\ninto question the objectivity of the benchmark policies?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Absolutely not. I think it reflects the free \\\\nmarket perspective that many investors have different \\\\nperspectives. We need to develop different policies. I think \\\\nthere is an overabundance of focus on benchmark policy, but, as \\\\nwe have said, it does not reflect the majority of our clients \\\\nthat are using custom voting policies.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Okay. Mr. Friedman, in the remaining seconds I \\\\nhave here, when issuing recommendations under your board-\\\\naligned voting policy, has ISS made any recommendations against \\\\nthe board of directors&#x27; position on ESG proposals?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. The answer is this policy is new, and I don&#x27;t \\\\nbelieve it evolved in----\\\\n    Mr. Rose. My time has expired. And if I could, I would like \\\\nto get both of your firms to answer that question for the \\\\nrecord. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. I will be happy to do so.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentlewoman from Georgia, Ms. \\\\nWilliams, is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank \\\\nyou to all of our witnesses for joining us today.\\\\n    My goal on this committee is to ensure that underserved and \\\\nunderrepresented communities have a strong advocate when it \\\\ncomes to issues that impact their economic mobility. As a \\\\nCongresswoman from Georgia&#x27;s 5th Congressional District, I \\\\nrepresent many large, profitable companies headquartered in my \\\\nhometown of Atlanta. Despite the success that these companies \\\\ncontinue to have, Atlanta still has the largest racial wealth \\\\ngap in the entire country. There are countless obstacles that \\\\nprevent people of color from building wealth, but a lack of \\\\nagency over their investments should never be one.\\\\n    Hardworking Americans, particularly marginalized \\\\nindividuals, deserve to have a say in the companies that they \\\\nare invested in. Shareholder proposals play an extremely \\\\nimportant role in allowing investors and marginalized people, \\\\nwho are not represented on corporate boards, to have a seat at \\\\nthe table. In fact, many common practices that improve \\\\ncorporate governance and increase profitability, like \\\\nindependent board leadership, board diversity, sustainability \\\\nreporting, and non-discrimination policies, came out of early \\\\nshareholder proposals. These policies are now widely considered \\\\nto be best practices and are hallmarks of well-run businesses.\\\\n    Proxy advisers are essential to make sure that shareholders \\\\nare fully equipped to vote based on their best interests and \\\\npriorities. And apparently, Republicans want shareholders to be \\\\nas uninformed as possible, concentrating companies&#x27; decision-\\\\nmaking power in the hands of a few board members and taking \\\\npower away from investors. Limiting the input of marginalized \\\\npeople by placing all of the power in the hands of those who \\\\nalready hold it is nothing new.\\\\n    Republicans in my home State of Georgia passed S.B. 202 in \\\\n2021, which preferences the type of voting by people they do \\\\nlike and limits the kinds of voting by people they don&#x27;t like. \\\\nThe implementation of S.B. 202 in Georgia caused the largest \\\\nracial turnout gap in decades, and now Republicans want to copy \\\\nand paste this nationally and across all industries. This \\\\nhearing is a prime example that they are trying to forcibly \\\\nlimit, once again, the voices of marginalized people, and \\\\ndirect the power to board members who share their policy \\\\npositions and views.\\\\n    As I mentioned before, shareholder proposals are a critical \\\\ntool used by investors and stakeholders, which raise material \\\\nissues for companies that can save money and improve company \\\\nperformance. They provide an opportunity for shareholders, \\\\nespecially those from marginalized communities who have \\\\nhistorically been shut out from corporate boards, to voice \\\\ntheir views, a fundamental right for anyone who buys stock in a \\\\ncompany.\\\\n    Professor Rajgopal, can you explain why shareholder \\\\nengagement is a fundamental right for investors?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. As I said earlier, the contract in governance \\\\nis that I give you money, capital, and what have you done for \\\\nme the next year or next quarter, and one of the ways to get \\\\nthat dialogue going is a shareholder proposal. If you actually \\\\nget rid of shareholder proposals, extreme things will happen. \\\\nEither the number of lawsuits will go up, or you will have \\\\nactivists, like Elliott and the others, banging on your door, \\\\nso this is not a bad compromise. This is some that we have \\\\nright now.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. And how do shareholder proposals \\\\nprovide an avenue to empower investors from marginalized \\\\ncommunities? Do they have the potential to impact the racial \\\\nwealth gap?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Maybe. One of the ideas here is the license \\\\nto operate, meaning, if you operate in a State or a \\\\nmunicipality implicitly, society gives you the license to go do \\\\nthat. Maybe that is the angle to motivate what you are saying.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman, you have been with ISS for nearly 20 years \\\\nand you cited in your testimony that ISS is a registered \\\\ninvestment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act (IAA). \\\\nThis means that you are required to render advice that is in \\\\nthe client&#x27;s best interest. One of the proposed discussion \\\\ndrafts would make changes to the IAA requiring a passive fund \\\\nto vote in accordance with instructions from the beneficial \\\\nowner, the issuer, or abstain from voting. How would this \\\\nproposal hurt oversight of corporate governance by investors?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congresswoman, I think ultimately, the \\\\ninvestors and whatever the nature of the investors, their \\\\nability to have the information they need and to vote in \\\\naccordance with what they believe is in the best interest of \\\\ntheir own beneficiaries, I think it is just critical. So, I \\\\nwould be concerned that anything that undermines that would be \\\\nproblematic for the investment community.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. And how will this proposal \\\\nsideline the interest of any investors from marginalized \\\\ncommunities whose hard-earned money is invested in such a fund?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congresswoman, I guess, respectfully, I \\\\nunderstand the question. It is not, I think, and sort of to the \\\\npoint of ISS&#x27;s role in what we do as being an information \\\\nagent, not one that we really have an organization.\\\\n    Ms. Williams of Georgia. And I am out of time, but I would \\\\nlove to follow up on this with answers in writing. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. I am going to request unanimous consent \\\\nto enter an article from The Wall Street Journal, I believe it \\\\nwas today, ``Cracking the Proxy Advisory Duopoly.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Without objection, I also will be submitting a request for \\\\nunanimous consent to enter a letter from the National \\\\nAssociation of Manufacturers, who testified earlier today in \\\\nthe Capital Markets Subcommittee, to the record, highlighting \\\\nthe proxy firms&#x27; continued conflicts of interest, propensity \\\\nfor errors, and unwillingness to engage with companies.\\\\n    Without objection, it is so ordered.\\\\n    And I request unanimous consent to enter a letter to the \\\\nrecord from the Business Roundtable, highlighting concerns \\\\nabout the influence proxy advisory firms wield in the \\\\nshareholder voting process.\\\\n    Without objection, it is so ordered.\\\\n    The gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, is recognized \\\\nfor 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate \\\\nit. Thank you as well to our witnesses for appearing today.\\\\n    Proxy voting has been very highlighted this week by this \\\\ncommittee and has proven to be an alarming situation. Proxy \\\\nadvisers, in theory, advise shareholders on how to vote and lay \\\\nout their options. However, proxy advisers have demonstrated a \\\\nbias aimed at furthering self-serving goals. Two firms, Glass \\\\nLewis and ISS, as we all know, make up about 95 percent of the \\\\nproxy advising and voting. They advocate for ESG mandates and \\\\nrequirements, then get paid to manage ESG integration in the \\\\ncompanies that they voted such mandates into, demonstrating \\\\nwhat appears to be a conflict of interest and not the interests \\\\nof shareholders to whom they provide such advice.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal, an Ernst &amp; Young report in March shows that \\\\nESG data provided generate revenues in excess of $1 billion \\\\nglobally in 2020. It is on the rise. In 2022, Glass Lewis \\\\nlaunched ESG scores and data in their proxy paper to further \\\\nhighlight ESG themes, all while Glass Lewis revenue comes from \\\\nits consulting with companies about how to manage their ESG \\\\nintegration.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Thank you for the question. We did launch ESG \\\\ndata points at the behest and request of our institutional \\\\ninvestor clients, who sought timely information of data that \\\\nwas collected at the time of the proxy statements release. Did \\\\na company evolve its DEI program? Did the company have a new \\\\nclimate action plan, for instance? We do not provide consulting \\\\nadvice.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. So, you don&#x27;t solicit those that you consulted \\\\ntowards ESG?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. No.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Okay. You are a proxy advisory, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. The data can be used, again, to the point of \\\\ncustom policy for clients who choose it.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Okay. So, one door does the advisement and the \\\\nother door across the hall does the sales?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. There is no advisement. As I have stated, \\\\nthere is no consulting on ESG. Glass Lewis does not do \\\\nconsulting on ESG. The clients have sought data points that are \\\\nactionable----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. You do the proxy voting, though?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. ----so that they can make voting decisions, \\\\nbut it is not used in the benchmark policy.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Okay. You are under oath, right?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. It is not used in the benchmark policy.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Okay. Well, that is contrary to the information \\\\nthat we have. You folks do the voting proxy----\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. It is informative. The ESG profile page is \\\\ninformative, but it is not used in the benchmark voting policy.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Okay. So, we are playing more games here. Those \\\\ncompanies that you serve as a proxy adviser for, you then \\\\nsolicit to manage their ESG integration?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. We don&#x27;t do any consulting. We scrape the data \\\\nfrom their proxy statements and their annual report at the time \\\\nof the solicitation period, and we build a profile page.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Okay. Glass Lewis specifically references the \\\\nfact that its proxy papers will include critical sustainability \\\\nmeasurements of global compact scores, ESG scores, and business \\\\ninvolvements. Glass Lewis is simultaneously selling ESG \\\\nproducts and providing proxy voting research and \\\\nrecommendations. So, everything I am reading here is totally \\\\nincorrect?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. The institutional investors can use that data \\\\nfor custom voting policy application, not benchmark policy.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. You don&#x27;t have to hide your business.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Let me further explain what they use it for. \\\\nThey also use it for engagement purposes, for example, if they \\\\nidentify a company that is a laggard, in their view, on climate \\\\ndisclosures----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. We will just have to dig into this further \\\\nalong the way.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman, is it standard practice for ISS Corporate \\\\nSolutions to solicit companies that receive the negative voting \\\\nrecommendation from ISS during the previous year? Just answer \\\\nthat question plain.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. It is not a standard practice----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. No?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. ----but ISS Corporate Solutions, which is a \\\\nsubsidiary of ISS----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Okay. Where do you get your revenue from?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Our revenue comes from a multitude of \\\\nbusiness lines----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Do you engage in proxy voting for those so-\\\\ncalled clients?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. To be clear, Congressman, we provide proxy \\\\nresearch and recommendations to institutional investors. We \\\\nhave a subsidiary entity, Corporate Solutions, which does work \\\\nand provides services.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. It is alarming that any business needs to dance \\\\naround what its standard practices are for its work, and its \\\\nadvisement, and its actions, and where its revenues come from. \\\\nThat is alarming, too.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, with respect----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman yields back. The \\\\ngentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Garcia, is recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize to the \\\\nwitnesses that I had to step out and I may have missed a couple \\\\nof questions, but I will try not to be repetitive of anything \\\\nyou have already been asked.\\\\n    First, I do want to thank you all for being here, and \\\\nresponding to some of our questions, and making your \\\\npresentations because I think that we can all agree that there \\\\nis some sort of proxy advisory form that is necessary. And I \\\\nwould love to work with my colleagues across the aisle on such \\\\nmeasures. However, Republicans are going about reforms, in my \\\\njudgment, in the wrong way today. It seems that, once again, \\\\nRepublicans are siding with Big Business and corporate \\\\nmanagement by attacking proxy advisers simply because they \\\\noffer advice and recommendations that may contradict corporate \\\\nmanagers&#x27; wishes.\\\\n    This hearing today is another example of what some of our \\\\nRepublicans are calling so-called anti-woke agenda, attacking \\\\nESG disclosures in anything that contradicts Big Business and \\\\ntheir wishes.\\\\n    If a proxy adviser offers a vote recommendation to a \\\\nshareholder that contradicts SEOs&#x27; wish list, it doesn&#x27;t \\\\nautomatically make it woke. In fact, I still can&#x27;t figure out \\\\nwhat, ``woke,&#x27;&#x27; really means. Let&#x27;s be clear: Proxy advisers \\\\nserve an important role in the market. They offer independent \\\\nadvice and analysis on shareholder proxy votes. Proxy advisers \\\\noften represent smaller investors, and they level the playing \\\\nfield for these investors who might not have the resources on \\\\ntheir own to extend extensively research every single \\\\nshareholder proposal up for a vote.\\\\n    I can tell you I have looked at some of these, and even as \\\\na lawyer, I can&#x27;t understand what they are saying. With that in \\\\nmind, I would like to proceed with some questions, and I want \\\\nto start with the professor. Professor, is it, ``Rajgopal?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. ``Raj,&#x27;&#x27; phonetic. Yes.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. I will call you, ``professor.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. That is good.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. You wouldn&#x27;t believe this, but some people \\\\nstill call me, ``Garcer,&#x27;&#x27; rather than, ``Garcia,&#x27;&#x27; so I am \\\\nsensitive about that. Do proxy advisers always recommend in \\\\nfavor of climate or social proposals?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. I would need to go look at the data, but I \\\\nwould assume not.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. You would assume not. So, this whole credit \\\\nglobal statement that is all that they are doing, and they are \\\\nharmful, and et cetera, doesn&#x27;t really stand up. Do you decide \\\\nwhich shareholder proposals come up for a vote as a proxy \\\\nadviser?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. I don&#x27;t think they do.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. You don&#x27;t think they do? What factors do you \\\\nthink they consider?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. They have qualitative data on the website, as \\\\nwas alluded to. Their models are proprietary, whatever math \\\\nthey do, so I am guessing they are looking at CEO compensation, \\\\nboard structure, and performance. Something along those lines \\\\nwould be the three big ones, I would say.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. So, it is not automatic that there will be a \\\\npart of anything related to the advancing an ESG or a, ``woke \\\\nagenda.&#x27;&#x27; They look at facts and their recommendations on \\\\neverything that they do, do they not?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. That is what I would do, and ESG is as \\\\npecuniary as anything else.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Okay. I really cannot read your nameplate, sir. \\\\nAre you the one with----\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Steven Friedman with ISS.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Right. The same question.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Mr. Shostal from Glass Lewis.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. The same question.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. I&#x27;m sorry, Congresswoman. Could you please \\\\nrepeat that?\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Right. The advisers don&#x27;t automatically \\\\nrecommend an ESG agenda or any, ``woke agenda.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. That is absolutely correct, and, in fact, we \\\\nhave multiple policies. On any particular issue, we may \\\\nactually recommend different opposing vote tracks to different \\\\nclients who have chosen different policies and different \\\\nperspectives and then, of course, the custom policies, where it \\\\nreally is exactly how the client thinks about that. That is a \\\\nlittle bit of a long answer, but the answer is that it&#x27;s simply \\\\nnot the case that we are supporting, that we are recommending \\\\nin favor of all so-called E&amp;S proposals.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. What criteria do you use before you make a \\\\nrecommendation?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Again, the criteria vary according to the \\\\ndifferent policies, but fundamentally, we are looking at sort \\\\nof materiality and looking at how things will impact the \\\\ncompany, and, again, really from the perspective of the \\\\nshareholders, and how they are thinking about those particular \\\\nissues, and how they choose to weigh them.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Mr. Chairman, if the last witness----\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Sorry, but the gentlelady&#x27;s----\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. No, I am asking if we could make sure that the \\\\nremaining witness submits his response in writing.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Submit the question to the Chair and we \\\\nwill pass that along.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Good. Thank you. Sorry about that; I ran out of \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. We are going to skip a couple of other \\\\nMembers on the Republican side and go to Mr. Sherman, who is \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Thank you. Yesterday and today seem to be a \\\\nRepublican-led attack on the free market system. Everybody who \\\\nbuys into a mutual fund can decide which mutual fund they go \\\\ninto, and if you think BlackRock votes its shares the wrong \\\\nway, go to State Street or Vanguard. I don&#x27;t have time to list \\\\nall of the choices. Then, each of these companies can go to \\\\nwhatever investment proxy advisory firm they want.\\\\n    Professor, are there particular barriers to entry that \\\\nprevent there being a wide variety of proxy advisory firms?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Not a legal one, but there might be economic \\\\nbarriers to entry. This is a low-margin business, so who wants \\\\nto enter, right? I don&#x27;t know whether it is a low-margin \\\\nbusiness, but I would hypothesize that if it is a low-margin \\\\nbusiness, perhaps, nobody wants to enter.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. I don&#x27;t know what would be a low-market--I \\\\ngive advice away for free, so I am in this market now. Free \\\\nadvice--how to vote any proxy, I just undercut the market. I \\\\nwill ask the other two witnesses, starting at the far right \\\\nthere, is there much of a barrier to entry to get into your \\\\nbusiness?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, we don&#x27;t see artificial barriers \\\\nto entry, and as I mentioned in my opening statement, there \\\\nactually is a new proxy advisory service.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. And Vivek Ramaswamy has created that. Is that \\\\ncorrect?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Is he known for being, ``woke?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. As I read about him, no, I believe he wrote a \\\\nbook on, ``anti-woke.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Professor, do you think Mr. Ramaswamy \\\\nqualifies as, ``woke?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Not at all. He is colorful, but not, \\\\n``woke.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. So, you can get advice from one side or the \\\\nother, you can invest in one mutual fund or another, and how \\\\nelse would these major firms go about deciding how to vote \\\\ntheir proxy? Go back into history. Was there a time when the \\\\nmajor mutual funds and pension funds would almost automatically \\\\njust vote the way management asked them to? Professor?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Yes, that is my understanding.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. I can see why the most powerful people in \\\\nAmerica would like it that way. These are the managements of \\\\nthe biggest companies, and they want the shareholders to be \\\\nhobbled and blinded and to rubber-stamp whatever they are \\\\ndoing. I will ask the witness who hasn&#x27;t responded to one of my \\\\nquestions, how else would these companies know how to vote if \\\\nthey didn&#x27;t get advice?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. To your point, it would be extremely costly \\\\nand ineffective for institutional investors, who specialize in \\\\ndeveloping investment products, to actually do the work of \\\\nanalyzing the thousands of agenda items.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Is there anything preventing someone from \\\\ncreating a mutual fund that only invests in fossil fuels or \\\\nalways votes for fossil fuels? Professor, is there anything \\\\nthat prevents you from creating the worst-sleep or not-woke \\\\nmutual fund?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Vivek has a fund called DRLL, which does \\\\nexactly what you are asking about--DRLL is the ticker symbol.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. They invest in fossil fuel, and they \\\\nconsistently vote for a non-Biden approach on these issues. So, \\\\nwe either have a system where investors get to do what they \\\\nwant with their own money or we have a system where government \\\\ntries to prevent that from happening in an effective way. And, \\\\nmy God, the anti-capitalist party is the party that was once \\\\nthe party of Ronald Reagan, who would be so embarrassed to be \\\\nhere today. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman \\\\nfrom Wisconsin, Mr. Steil, is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Thank you very much, Chairman Huizenga, for \\\\nholding today&#x27;s hearing and for waiving me on to the \\\\nsubcommittee.\\\\n    The proxy advisory industry has some pretty obvious \\\\nshortcomings, and Chairman Gensler&#x27;s efforts to shortcut \\\\ncritical safeguards are fueling an ongoing wave of social \\\\nactivism. I think it ultimately hurts American investors, \\\\nparticularly those concerned about their retirement income. It \\\\nis why we introduced pretty substantive legislation regarding \\\\nproxy advisers. The process would require proxy advisers to \\\\nmake important disclosures about methodology, staffing, and \\\\nconflicts of interest. It also gives companies the ability to \\\\ncorrect false or misleading statements, and alters and \\\\nrestricts the use of robo-voting. I think some of these are \\\\npretty commonsense reforms to improve an industry with immense \\\\npower over our economy and, in particular, Americans&#x27; \\\\nretirement savings.\\\\n    And before I start my questions, Mr. Chairman, I seek \\\\nunanimous consent to enter into the record: an editorial from \\\\nThe Wall Street Journal on this topic; a study by the Milken \\\\nInstitute; and two articles by Professor Rajgopal regarding my \\\\nlegislation.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. I would like to thank Professor Rajgopal for \\\\nsome of his supportive statements on my legislation. In your \\\\nanalysis, you wrote the following: ``Registration seems like a \\\\npretty good idea to me, partly because it is ironic that an \\\\nindustry devoted to assisting institutional investors govern \\\\ncompanies is itself highly opaque and unregulated.&#x27;&#x27; Is that \\\\nright? You said that?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Absolutely. That is what I said in my opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. And you said, ``An interested user who visits \\\\nthe ISS website will find next to no information about their \\\\nrevenues, segments under which the revenues earned, and how ISS \\\\narbitrates between conflict in the provision of such services \\\\nacross both sides of the market they serve.&#x27;&#x27; Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. And then, you just said that you think it is a \\\\nlow-margin business. How would you know that if you don&#x27;t \\\\nknow----\\\\n    Mr. Rajgopal. I said that I don&#x27;t know.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. You don&#x27;t know, so we are just hypothesizing \\\\nwhether or not it is a low-margin business. A lot of consulting \\\\nbusinesses that I know are pretty high-margin businesses, so I \\\\ndon&#x27;t know either. The revenues are opaque. It is not reported. \\\\nWe are not under SEC oversight. I think we should be. That is \\\\nwhat Chairman Clayton put forward, a rule that was obviously \\\\ngutted by Chairman Gensler, to allow our two largest proxy \\\\nadvisers to operate kind of in this opaque manner.\\\\n    If I can start with you, Mr. Friedman, in your testimony, \\\\nyou state that ISS provides institutional investors with \\\\nobjective, timely, and expert proxy research and vote \\\\nrecommendations. If I can, I am going to dive in on the expert \\\\nproxy research. What is the process for formulating a vote \\\\nrecommendation, and does ISS conduct an analysis to determine \\\\nif a proposal could induce an issuer to violate State or \\\\nFederal laws?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, thank you for the question. The \\\\nbasic process is we have a global research team, and that team \\\\nwill take the policy at issue for the particular client.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Let me get to the specifics, though. Do you \\\\nanalyze whether or not the proposal would violate State or \\\\nFederal law?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. That is not something that would typically be \\\\npart of our analysis.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. So, you don&#x27;t review if something is illegal or \\\\nnot in your advice?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, there is a process. When it \\\\ncomes to shareholder proposals with the SEC, to the extent that \\\\nthere are a variety of grounds upon which the SEC is able to \\\\nadvise a company, that proposal does not need to show up on the \\\\nballot.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Understood. So, you just accept the SEC. For \\\\nexample, in the Travelers case, I would say that would have \\\\nrequired Travelers to engage in illegal behavior by pricing \\\\ninsurance based on race. The SEC allowed that proposal to go \\\\nforward. Once the SEC allowed that proposal to go forward, \\\\nthere is no further check or analysis as to whether or not such \\\\na passage would be legal or illegal by ISS.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. I do think relying on the SEC is legal \\\\nanalysis.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. So, you rely on the SEC, with no further check. \\\\nIf I come over to you as it relates to Glass Lewis, do you have \\\\na further check? As it relates to legal or illegal action by a \\\\nshareholder proposal, do you review State or Federal law?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. As a matter of fact, I think we have engaged \\\\nwith Travelers, if you recall, so we had the opportunity to \\\\ndiscuss with them their legal concerns. And we concluded it is \\\\na non-binding preparatory proposal, but there were certain \\\\naspects of the proposal that didn&#x27;t feel necessarily warranted, \\\\nbut there were aspects with the companies. There were pecuniary \\\\nissues. First of all, the company had some settlement----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Understood. Let me shift gears, because I have \\\\nsuch limited time. Do you analyze the best economic interests \\\\nof shareholders when you analyze the shareholder proposals?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Would you like an example?\\\\n    Mr. Steil. I am just saying----\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Yes, absolutely. As a matter of fact, a water \\\\nutility in New Jersey, recently headquartered in New Jersey, \\\\ngot a racial equity proposal, and we balanced the company&#x27;s \\\\nhuman capital management policies against the company&#x27;s stated \\\\n$1.4 billion cost of implementing the proposal, and we have \\\\nrecommended against the proposal and supportive management. \\\\nThat happens----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. I am cognizant of my time. I would just love to \\\\nsee more transparency in how you conduct the analysis under \\\\nwhich I think additional transparency would not only benefit \\\\nyou----\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman&#x27;s time----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. ----but I think would benefit the American \\\\npeople.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. With that, the ranking member of the \\\\nsubcommittee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Permit me to ask a \\\\ncouple of questions. Mr. Friedman, I will start with you. \\\\nSometimes diction can have an impact on one&#x27;s perception. To \\\\ncall someone an, ``activist investor,&#x27;&#x27; conscious of a certain \\\\nimage, would you give me an example of the typical investor \\\\nthat you happen to represent? By the way, investors are owners, \\\\nso we are talking about activist owners now, people who \\\\nactually own the business. Give me an example of a typical \\\\nowner that you might represent?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, thank you. Our clients are \\\\ninstitutional investors, and they really are a range of \\\\ninvestors from small, medium, and large. You can expect----\\\\n    Mr. Green. A small, give me the size of a small, just any \\\\nsmall?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. It could be an investment adviser who has a \\\\nsmall shop with a handful of employees, up to the largest asset \\\\nmanagers in the world, and everyone in between.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Largest in the world, give me an example in \\\\nterms of dollars associated with that being capitalized.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. No, I don&#x27;t have that information.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Just an estimate. I am not holding you to it.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Congressman, I would----\\\\n    Mr. Green. Is it a billion or they were----\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. I would imagine it is billions, if not \\\\ntrillions.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Billions, if not trillions of dollars.\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Please don&#x27;t quote me on this.\\\\n    Mr. Green. They are not typically people walking around \\\\nwith a sign protesting outside of some corporation that they \\\\nwould like to see change policies?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. That is not my assessment of our client base.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Okay. Thank you very much. Let&#x27;s go to the next \\\\ngentleman, please. Your clients?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. I think just institutional investors have \\\\ndifferent perspectives on what may be material, whether it is \\\\nwe have discussed----\\\\n    Mr. Green. But without getting into that, I am just \\\\ninterested in the size right now, the size?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. As Mr. Friedman shared, there is going to be a \\\\nbroad range of investors, some large pension funds. For \\\\nexample, European large pension funds may be more active or \\\\nactivist, and conversely, there are going to be some much \\\\nsmaller----\\\\n    Mr. Green. These large firms, do they have lawyers?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. I would imagine so.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Do you think they have accountants?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. I would imagine.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Do they have in-house advisers?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. Again, don&#x27;t quote me, but I would imagine so.\\\\n    Mr. Green. I don&#x27;t assume that you check off a list, but if \\\\nyou are a billion-dollar company, you probably do have a \\\\nbattery of lawyers, more than likely. Do you find that they are \\\\nwell-equipped to ask the appropriate questions related to the \\\\nadvice that they seek?\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. In my experience, yes, based on once they have \\\\nevaluated what is material in their investment belief and \\\\nphilosophy, that then trickles down not just into the \\\\ninvestment process, but into the stewardship in the voting and \\\\nengagement process.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Now, I have a document that was published by my \\\\ncolleagues on the other side. It evidences some of the \\\\nlegislation that they are proposing. There is an H.R. that \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t have a number, that is a bill to authorize the \\\\nexclusion of shareholder proposals from proxy or consent \\\\nsolicitation material if the subject matter of the shareholder \\\\nproposal is environmental, social, or political. If that is \\\\nenacted, could that have an impact on some of the clients that \\\\nyou might represent, Mr. Friedman?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Ultimately, our clients vote as it relates to \\\\nthe service we provide. It is whatever is on the agenda, so to \\\\nthe extent there are more or less different proposals on the \\\\nagenda, it certainly would be an issue for them to consider. \\\\nBut where we sit in the process is to help them within the \\\\nframework of their chosen policies to assess those agenda \\\\nitems----\\\\n    Mr. Green. I understand, but this proposal would exclude \\\\nenvironmental. If you had an insurance company, would it be of \\\\nsome benefit to them to know about environmental issues in \\\\nFlorida, for example?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. Yes, I think many shareholders would find \\\\nthat to be extremely valuable, but in fairness, there are some \\\\nwho may not see----\\\\n    Mr. Green. I understand there would be some who would not, \\\\nbut those who do, that contact you, you do represent them, too, \\\\ndon&#x27;t you?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. We do provide services to a range of \\\\ninstitutions. Yes, that is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Okay. And finally, do you find that your clients \\\\nbelieve that evidence related to diversity and inclusion is \\\\nimportant? Yes or no?\\\\n    Mr. Friedman. For many, it is.\\\\n    Mr. Shostal. For many, it is, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Huizenga. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. I \\\\nappreciate the witnesses for giving us their time today and \\\\ntheir testimony.\\\\n    The Chair notes that some Members may have additional \\\\nquestions for this panel, which they may wish to submit in \\\\nwriting.

French Hill \\\\n[chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.\\\\n    Members present: Representatives Hill, Lucas, Emmer, \\\\nDavidson, Rose, Steil, Timmons, Flood; Lynch, Foster, Sherman, \\\\nCasten, and Nickel.\\\\n    Ex officio present: Representatives McHenry and Waters.\\\\n    Also present: Representative Himes.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Good morning. The Subcommittee on Digital \\\\nAssets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion will come to order.\\\\n    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a \\\\nrecess of the subcommittee at any time.\\\\n    I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here today, \\\\nand I now recognize myself for 4 minutes for an opening \\\\nstatement.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s hearing is entitled, ``Fostering Financial \\\\nInnovation: How Agencies Can Leverage Technology to Shape the \\\\nFuture of Financial Services.&#x27;&#x27; The story of America is about \\\\ntechnological innovation and the application of the American \\\\nwork ethic and capital. Over our 250-year history, steam, rail, \\\\ntelephone, air, radio, television, fission, IT, the chip, \\\\nvaccines--all of these things are possible because we allow \\\\ninnovation. We facilitate it in our society. Today, new and \\\\nemerging technologies like digital assets, distributed ledgers, \\\\nquantum computing, and greater use of artificial intelligence \\\\n(AI) are dominating the discussion.\\\\n    We have to remind ourselves that innovation has always been \\\\nat the heart, too, of, financial services. In fact, financial \\\\ntechnology, or fintech as we call it, is hardly new. With the \\\\nadvent of the credit card in 1950, the first ATM in 1967, the \\\\nfirst electronic securities exchange in 1971, computer-based \\\\naccess to bank accounts in the 1980s, and peer-to-peer (P2P) \\\\npayments in the 1990s, innovation has always been transforming \\\\nthe relationship between consumers, businesses, and their \\\\nfinancial services providers and their money.\\\\n    But today, we want to talk about how government agencies, \\\\nwhile they are not frequently at the forefront of innovation, \\\\nthey definitely can stop innovation dead in its tracks. We \\\\nrecall President Reagan&#x27;s very fond conversation about what he \\\\nthinks government thinks of the economy, ``If it moves, tax it. \\\\nIf it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, \\\\nsubsidize it.&#x27;&#x27; And that is the challenge we always have in \\\\nhere, in Congress, is making sure that we facilitate \\\\ninnovation, and that we work with our regulators to do that.\\\\n    Over the years, Congress has added ombudsmen in agencies \\\\njust to represent the people who are regulated, to make sure \\\\nthey get a fair shake. We have added cost-benefit analysis \\\\nthrough the Administrative Procedure Act, to make sure that the \\\\nrules that are pronounced actually make sense and have some \\\\ncommon sense associated with it. And, of course, we apply our \\\\noversight capability, which we are doing today.\\\\n    It was only a few years ago that some of your agencies \\\\nbegan establishing specific offices dedicated to facilitating \\\\nresponsible innovation, and many of you lead those offices at \\\\nyour respective agencies. This hearing is the first time that \\\\nthe committee has called upon each of you to testify about your \\\\nagency&#x27;s work related to innovation. And regrettably, when I \\\\nlook at the Government Accountability Office&#x27;s (GAO&#x27;s) recent \\\\nreport, maybe some of that progress is lacking, so we will have \\\\na good discussion about that today.\\\\n    Let me recap some of the actions taken by President Biden&#x27;s \\\\nregulators. The Federal Reserve announced a Novel Activities \\\\nSupervision Program in August for enhanced supervision on new \\\\nactivities related to fintech and digital assets. The National \\\\nCredit Union Administration (NCUA) established its Office of \\\\nFinancial Technology and Access in January of this year. While \\\\nthe Office is engaging with stakeholders and hosting public \\\\npresentations, it has yet to establish a workforce planning \\\\nprocess to ensure the staff have the knowledge and skills \\\\nnecessary to carry out its mission over fintech.\\\\n    The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&#x27;s (CFPB&#x27;s) Office \\\\nof Innovation was founded in 2018, to encourage consumer-\\\\nfriendly innovation, but was replaced in 2022 by the Office of \\\\nCompetition and Innovation, and two of the most innovation-\\\\nforward policies that had been previously established were \\\\ndiscontinued.\\\\n    The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) was the \\\\nearliest regulator to establish an Innovation Office back in \\\\n2016, but that office was dissolved into the Office of \\\\nFinancial Technology in March, and the individual who \\\\nreportedly lied about his extensive industry experience and \\\\neducation was placed at the helm. So maybe, we should have some \\\\noversight of that too.\\\\n    I look forward to the discussion today, and I now yield to \\\\nthe ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Lynch, for 5 \\\\nminutes for an opening statement.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this \\\\nimportant hearing to explore how financial regulators play an \\\\nimportant role in fostering and regulating innovation in the \\\\nfinancial services space. I would like to thank our witnesses \\\\nfor their willingness to share their agencies&#x27; expertise and \\\\ntheir critical work with this committee.\\\\n    Under the Trump Administration, several regulators \\\\nestablished Offices of Innovation to purportedly encourage \\\\ninnovation and prevent unnecessary regulatory barriers. \\\\nHowever, in practice, it became evident that some of these \\\\noffices were simply a vehicle for lowering regulatory \\\\nstandards. Agencies issued rules that received significant \\\\npushback from consumer advocates and were the subject of \\\\nlitigation initiated by State regulators.\\\\n    For example, the CFPB issued a handful of no-action letters \\\\nthat were criticized for protecting individual companies from \\\\nenforcement action when they broke the law, leading to the risk \\\\nof consumer harm. Additionally, the OCC attempted to issue \\\\nfintech charters, which would have allowed nonbank fintech \\\\ncompanies to operate like a bank without being subject to \\\\ncomprehensive depositor oversight.\\\\n    If we truly value innovation, we should want regulators to \\\\npolice bad actors who are evading laws so that innovative \\\\ncompanies, playing by the rules, can have a level playing field \\\\nto be profitable while also working in the interest of \\\\nconsumers. I am encouraged that under the current \\\\nAdministration, regulators have transitioned these Offices of \\\\nInnovation to focus greater attention on market monitoring, \\\\ncompetition, and integrating innovation into existing \\\\nregulatory functions.\\\\n    The CFPB has focused on improving competition in data \\\\nprotection through its data portability rulemaking. The SEC&#x27;s \\\\nStrategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) \\\\nengages in understanding distributed ledger technology and \\\\nartificial intelligence.\\\\n    I also applaud the ways regulators have explored and \\\\ncautioned against the risks of digital assets. In January, the \\\\nFed, the FDIC, and the OCC issued a joint statement that \\\\ncautioned banks against involvement in crypto assets, citing \\\\nheightened liquidity, volatility, and fraud risks. The collapse \\\\nof FTX and of Silvergate Bank last year, a prominent banking \\\\npartner for crypto companies illustrates the need for this type \\\\nof guidance.\\\\n    Additionally, both the OCC and the FDIC have used their \\\\ninnovation functions to increase scrutiny over bank-fintech \\\\npartnerships and the ways that can lead to regulatory evasion. \\\\nIn October, the Federal Reserve issued an enforcement action \\\\nagainst Metropolitan Commercial Bank for failing to properly \\\\noversee its fintech partner, MovoCash. An investigation found \\\\nthat as early as January 2020, fraud actors opened fraudulent \\\\nMovoCash accounts to improperly route direct deposit and \\\\ngovernment benefits. More than $300 million of pandemic \\\\nunemployment benefits were misdirected to fraud actors.\\\\n    Moreover, innovation does not need to come solely from the \\\\nprivate sector, and we should be encouraging government \\\\nagencies to innovate to improve financial access and \\\\nopportunity. With 130 countries, representing 98 percent of the \\\\nglobal GDP, exploring a government-issued central bank digital \\\\ncurrency (CBDC), the U.S. should not risk falling behind. I \\\\nfind it ironic that many of my colleagues on this subcommittee \\\\nwant regulators to encourage innovation, and yet are pushing \\\\nlegislation that shuts down a CBDC before agencies have \\\\nadequately researched and explored it.\\\\n    There are countless other services that government can \\\\nprovide, in coordination with the private sector, to expand \\\\nfinancial inclusion, and we should be encouraging this type of \\\\nexploration.\\\\n    I am eager to learn more about the ways agencies are \\\\nencouraging innovation in the financial sector, and I yield \\\\nback.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \\\\nrecognizes the Chair of the full Financial Services Committee, \\\\nMr. McHenry of North Carolina, for 1 minute.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. I want to thank you, Mr. Hill, and to \\\\neach of you, I want to thank you for the task and the important \\\\njob you have undertaken. Fostering innovation at institutions \\\\nand firms under your supervision is vital and important. Since \\\\nmy legislation to modernize and streamline how innovators \\\\ninteract with regulators, many agencies have established \\\\noffices focused on innovation. That is welcomed and positive.\\\\n    However, I am increasingly concerned that those offices, \\\\nyour offices, are not operating as intended. It is critical \\\\nthat firms, financial institutions of all sizes, and \\\\nentrepreneurs can go to market with innovative products sooner, \\\\nwhile maintaining important consumer protections. These offices \\\\nshould not be used to smother innovation and technology or \\\\nsimply ignore it.\\\\n    It is also important that we have the highest-quality folks \\\\nin charge of those offices. It is clear the Administration \\\\ncannot continue to only regulate by enforcement, and I \\\\nencourage each of you to stay focused on your mission and to \\\\nwork to provide regulatory certainty for the industry, \\\\nregulators, and consumers.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. I thank the chairman.\\\\n    Today, we welcome the testimony of Ms. Donna Murphy, the \\\\nActing Deputy Comptroller for the Office of Financial \\\\nTechnology, and the Deputy Comptroller for Compliance Risk \\\\nPolicy at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Mr. \\\\nCharles Vice, the Director of Financial Technology and Access \\\\nat the National Credit Union Administration; Ms. Valerie \\\\nSzczepanik, the Director of the SEC&#x27;s Strategic Hub for \\\\nInnovation and Financial Technology; Dr. Michael Gibson, the \\\\nDirector of the Federal Reserve Board&#x27;s Division of Supervision \\\\nand Regulation at the Board of Governors here at the Federal \\\\nReserve System; Ms. Ann Epstein, the Assistant Director of the \\\\nOffice of Competition and Innovation at the CFPB; and Mr. Mark \\\\nMulholland, the Deputy Chief Information Officer for Management \\\\nat the FDIC.\\\\n    We thank each of you for taking the time to be with us \\\\ntoday. Each of you will be recognized for 5 minutes to give an \\\\noral presentation of your testimony, and without objection, \\\\neach of your written statements will be made a part of the \\\\nrecord.\\\\n    Ms. Murphy, you are recognized for 5 minutes to give your \\\\noral remarks.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF DONNA MURPHY, DEPUTY COMPTROLLER, COMPLIANCE RISK \\\\n  POLICY, AND ACTING DEPUTY COMPTROLLER, OFFICE OF FINANCIAL \\\\n  TECHNOLOGY, OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC)\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. Thank you, Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Lynch, \\\\nChairman McHenry, and members of the subcommittee. I am pleased \\\\nto appear today to discuss the activities and initiatives of \\\\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency&#x27;s Office of \\\\nFinancial Technology.\\\\n    I am currently serving as the Acting Deputy Comptroller for \\\\nthe Office of Financial Technology, in addition to my permanent \\\\nposition as Deputy Comptroller for Compliance Risk Policy. In \\\\nmy acting capacity, I oversee the agency&#x27;s work relating to the \\\\nanalysis and evaluation of financial technology innovations, \\\\ntrends, emerging risks, and implications for OCC-supervised \\\\nbanks. My team of financial technology policy specialists \\\\nsupports the development of policy guidance, outreach, \\\\ntraining, and supervision resources for fintech-related \\\\nbusiness models, platforms, and applications.\\\\n    Over the years, the OCC has adapted its supervisory \\\\napproach to address the many technological innovations by OCC-\\\\nsupervised banks and to support responsible innovation in the \\\\nbanking industry. In 2016, the OCC became the first Federal \\\\nbanking agency to establish a dedicated Office of Innovation, \\\\nin order to provide a framework for activities related to \\\\nfinancial technology innovation.\\\\n    For the last 6 years, the Office of Innovation has also \\\\nconducted outreach, such as designated office hours, in which \\\\nstakeholders, including technology firms, banks, trade \\\\nassociations, academics, and consumer groups, interact with the \\\\nagency. Information gained from this outreach facilitates our \\\\nsupervisory approaches to supporting banks and responsibly \\\\ninnovating through the use of advanced technologies.\\\\n    In October 2022, the OCC announced that it would build upon \\\\nthis work by creating the Office of Financial Technology, which \\\\nincorporates the former Office of Innovation. The new office is \\\\nfocused on supporting responsible innovation and ensuring high-\\\\nquality guidance and supervision for banks&#x27; financial \\\\ntechnology implementation.\\\\n    The OCC&#x27;s current financial technology focus includes \\\\nmatters involving bank-fintech partnerships, and artificial \\\\nintelligence, digital assets and tokenization, as well as other \\\\nnew and changing technologies and business models that affect \\\\nOCC-supervised banks. Banks&#x27; relationships with third parties, \\\\nincluding fintech companies, continue to expand. The use of \\\\nthird parties has significant potential benefits, but strong \\\\nthird-party risk management is essential to avoid harm to \\\\nconsumers or weakening of bank safety and soundness.\\\\n    Earlier this year, the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal \\\\nReserve published interagency guidance on third-party \\\\nrelationships in risk management. This document reminds banks \\\\nof their responsibility to operate in a safe and sound manner, \\\\nin compliance with applicable laws and regulations, regardless \\\\nof whether their activities are performed in-house or \\\\noutsourced.\\\\n    The OCC also recognizes the considerable and growing \\\\ninterest by the banking industry in a wide range of uses for \\\\nartificial intelligence. When used appropriately, AI \\\\napplications such as chatbots, enhanced credit screening, and \\\\nfraud detection systems have the potential to strengthen safety \\\\nand soundness, improve banks&#x27; ability to address financial \\\\ncrime, and increase access to the banking sector for consumers. \\\\nBanks also are exploring newly-developed kinds of AI such as \\\\ngenerative AI, which can be used to generate text, images, or \\\\nother outputs from a given prompt. OCC-supervised institutions \\\\nare approaching generative AI with caution, and its use is not \\\\nwidespread in the Federal banking system.\\\\n    For all uses of AI in the banking sector, the OCC remains \\\\nfocused on the potential risks of adverse outcomes if bank use \\\\nof AI is not properly managed and controlled. We continue to \\\\nperform robust, risk-based supervision, monitor the industry, \\\\nand conduct research to ensure that the agency keeps pace with \\\\nfinancial sector changes.\\\\n    In addition, the OCC recognizes the potential of other \\\\ntechnologies, including distributed ledger technology, and we \\\\nmaintain a careful and cautious approach to their use while \\\\nindustry standards develop and legal and ethical questions are \\\\naddressed.\\\\n    Overall, however, the financial industry&#x27;s attention in the \\\\ndigital asset space appears to be shifting to the tokenization \\\\nof assets and liabilities. Tokenization is driven by solving \\\\nreal-world settlement problems and shows promising potential. \\\\nIn February, the OCC will host a symposium on tokenization to \\\\nexplore its legal foundations, use cases, and risk management \\\\nand control considerations.\\\\n    My written statement also discusses ways financial \\\\ntechnology innovation can be used to increase access to \\\\ntraditional financial services, and it describes some of the \\\\nOCC&#x27;s efforts to support this very important objective.\\\\n    In closing, rapid financial technology innovation requires \\\\na robust approach by financial regulators. The OCC is committed \\\\nto helping banks innovative, while evolving in a safe, sound, \\\\nand fair manner.\\\\n    Thank you, and I would be happy to answer questions about \\\\nthe OCC&#x27;s work to support financial technology.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Deputy Comptroller Murphy can be \\\\nfound on page 61 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Mr. Vice, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n STATEMENT OF CHARLES A. VICE, DIRECTOR, FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY \\\\n    AND ACCESS, NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION (NCUA)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Vice. Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Lynch, and members \\\\nof the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to discuss the \\\\nNational Credit Union Administration&#x27;s efforts to foster \\\\nfinancial technology. I am Charles A. Vice, Director of the \\\\nNCUA&#x27;s Office of Financial Technology and Access. I began my \\\\ncareer in 1990, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \\\\nserving as an examiner for 18 years. In 2008, I was appointed \\\\nCommissioner of the Kentucky Department of Financial \\\\nInstitutions, a position I held for 14 years before joining the \\\\nNCUA on January 1, 2023.\\\\n    During my 3 decades of experience, I have seen the \\\\nresiliency of the credit union and banking industries in the \\\\nface of such challenges as Y2K concerns, the Great Recession, \\\\nnatural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic. I have seen how \\\\ntechnology can be both a benefit and a risk that must be \\\\nproperly managed. On one hand, technology can improve \\\\nefficiency, facilitate better communication with members, and \\\\noffer round-the-clock services. On the other hand, technology \\\\nrepresents risks that must be managed, monitored, and \\\\nmitigated. The NCUA understands this fine balance.\\\\n    The NCUA&#x27;s Office of Financial Technology and Access \\\\nidentifies barriers, challenges, and opportunities credit \\\\nunions face in adopting and using technology to provide \\\\nfinancial services to their members. In 2023, the NCUA board \\\\nadopted the Financial Innovation Rule which provides additional \\\\nflexibility for federally-insured credit unions to use advanced \\\\ntechnologies and opportunities offered by the financial \\\\ntechnology sector. The proposed rule received supportive \\\\ncomments from the public during the notice-and-comment period \\\\nand was finalized in September.\\\\n    In addition, the NCUA is committed to promoting effective \\\\nand efficient use of the emerging technology. The agency has \\\\nimplemented several initiatives, including a virtual \\\\nexamination program and a digital asset working group. With the \\\\nvirtual examination program, the NCUA is exploring methods to \\\\nuse technology to improve examination and supervision \\\\nprocedures.\\\\n    The NCUA&#x27;s Digital Asset Working Group is an agency team \\\\nthat develops guidance for the credit union industry&#x27;s use of \\\\ndistributed ledger technology in offering digital asset and \\\\ncryptocurrency services to members.\\\\n    The NCUA is also evaluating digital identification \\\\ntechnology. The use of digital identification can be a useful \\\\ntool for verifying identity, and a number of States have issued \\\\nmobile driver&#x27;s licenses. Some credit unions have completed \\\\nsuccessful pilot tests using digital identification and are in \\\\nthe process of updating their policies and procedures to \\\\nincorporate this technology for onboarding new members.\\\\n    In 2024, ACCESS, which is an acronym for Advancing \\\\nCommunities through Credit, Education, Stability, &amp; Support, is \\\\nspearheading an initiative to improve access to financial \\\\nservices in financial deserts. This will highlight \\\\nopportunities for the agency to assist regions where credit \\\\nunion services are limited or certain segments of the \\\\npopulation are underserved.\\\\n    The initiative will also identify outreach opportunities, \\\\nensuring the NCUA&#x27;s actions are timely, relevant, and \\\\nimpactful. The ACCESS team will pilot a program to target \\\\noutreach for three communities in 2024. As part of the pilot, \\\\nthe NCUA will catalog and track the impact of the agency&#x27;s \\\\nfinancial inclusion efforts and identify additional gaps and \\\\nopportunities to foster financial inclusion.\\\\n    Finally, the NCUA&#x27;s lack of supervisory authority over \\\\ncredit union service organizations and third-party vendors is a \\\\nnoteworthy vulnerability for the industry. If Congress \\\\nreauthorizes the NCUA&#x27;s third-party vendor authority per the \\\\nNCUA Board Chair&#x27;s request, the agency will adopt a program and \\\\nprioritize examinations based on identified risks.\\\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify about the NCUA&#x27;s \\\\nefforts to foster financial technology and financial inclusion. \\\\nThis concludes my comments.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Director Vice can be found on \\\\npage 74 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you so much.\\\\n    Director Szczepanik, you are recognized for 5 minutes to \\\\ngive your oral presentation.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF VALERIE A. SZCZEPANIK, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF THE \\\\nSTRATEGIC HUB FOR INNOVATION AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY (FINHUB), \\\\n         U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Thank you. Chairman Hill, Ranking Member \\\\nLynch, Chairman McHenry, and members of the subcommittee, thank \\\\nyou for inviting me to testify before you today about the SEC&#x27;s \\\\nStrategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology, also \\\\nknown as FinHub. It is my honor to appear before you today to \\\\ndiscuss FinHub&#x27;s work. I am testifying today in my official \\\\ncapacity as Director of FinHub, but my testimony does not \\\\nnecessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the \\\\nCommissioners, or other members of the SEC staff. I am also \\\\npleased to see in attendance those who represent similar \\\\nfunctions to mine among the SEC&#x27;s regulatory partners.\\\\n    I have served as the head of FinHub since it was launched \\\\nin 2018, and became its Director when, in 2020, it was \\\\ndesignated as a standalone office reporting to the SEC Chair. \\\\nFinHub was designed to be an agile hub-and-spoke structure with \\\\neight full-time staff at the hub and experts from the agencies&#x27; \\\\ndivisions and offices in order to create a rapid communication \\\\nand coordination network across the agency and to avoid \\\\nsiloing. In this way, FinHub utilizes and augment&#x27;s the \\\\nagency&#x27;s expertise concerning leading-edge technologies and \\\\ninnovations that foreshadow the future direction of the \\\\nfinancial industry.\\\\n    FinHub helps the agency achieve its mission to protect \\\\ninvestors, maintain fair and orderly and efficient markets, and \\\\nfacilitate capital formation by helping coordinate the agency&#x27;s \\\\noversight of and responses to emerging financial technologies \\\\nacross numerous areas, including distributed ledger technology \\\\nand digital assets, automated investment advice, digital \\\\nmarketplace financing, and artificial intelligence. FinHub \\\\nidentifies and analyzes emerging financial technologies, builds \\\\nand enhances the agency&#x27;s expertise, and engages with market \\\\nparticipants, regulators, and other organizations to advance \\\\nthe SEC&#x27;s mission.\\\\n    More specifically, FinHub has three major functions. First, \\\\nwe are an external resource. Innovators and other members of \\\\nthe public can seek engagement with the SEC staff through \\\\nFinHub concerning technology, business models, and regulatory \\\\nissues. We also conduct active outreach with fintech \\\\ncommunities across the country, participating in outreach \\\\nevents such as conferences, classes, and tech sprints. Our \\\\nwebsite provides a clearinghouse of information regarding the \\\\nSEC&#x27;s activities in fintech, and we encourage market \\\\nparticipants to use the materials on our website as a resource \\\\nand to reach out to staff if they want to discuss issues.\\\\n    Second, we are an internal resource in that we evaluate the \\\\nimpact of rapidly-evolving and often unpredictable technology, \\\\nand we onboard the knowledge, tools, and data that we need in \\\\norder to provide subject matter expertise within the agency. \\\\nFinHub is a dedicated and specialized resource, staffed not \\\\nonly with attorneys but also with those having expertise in \\\\ncomputer science, financial analysis, and data research and \\\\nanalytics.\\\\n    We invest FinHub&#x27;s time and resources to cultivate a deep \\\\nfintech expertise so that other Commission staff can quickly \\\\nbenefit from our input and analyses, allowing them to perform \\\\ntheir day-to-day work. FinHub is committed to understanding the \\\\ntechnologies that impact our markets, and we are taking \\\\nproactive steps to make sure that the SEC staff has a hands-on \\\\nopportunity to work with new technology.\\\\n    Third, FinHub is a liaison. We actively monitor domestic \\\\nand international developments related to fintech, and we have \\\\nan ongoing engagement, both domestic and foreign, to actively \\\\nmonitor, understand, and respond to emerging issues.\\\\n    FinHub&#x27;s role is to help the agency strike the right \\\\nbalance between fostering beneficial and responsible innovation \\\\nin our capital markets, on the one hand, and preventing \\\\npotentially harmful and illicit practices against investors, on \\\\nthe other. The goal is to promote and maintain investor \\\\nconfidence and integrity in our markets as the markets \\\\nincorporate financial innovation. We hope that through \\\\nthoughtful engagement with innovators and others, and through \\\\nunderstanding emerging technologies, we strike the right \\\\nbalance.\\\\n    I believe that industry participants and others who take \\\\nthe time and effort to engage with the SEC staff and with the \\\\nstaff of our fellow regulatory agencies will play a critical \\\\nrole in shaping the future of fintech and ensuring that the \\\\nU.S. capital markets continue to adhere to the high standards \\\\nthat have made them so deep, liquid, fair, and attractive for \\\\ndecades.\\\\n    On a personal note, before I became a lawyer I earned my \\\\ndegree in engineering. It has been my great privilege to \\\\ncombine my passion for science, the law, and public service in \\\\nmy current role, and I am particularly grateful for the \\\\nopportunity to serve with extraordinarily-dedicated members of \\\\nmy staff and the staff who work with FinHub from across the \\\\nCommission. These colleagues are fully committed to serving \\\\ntheir country and to the agency&#x27;s mission and are a source of \\\\ninspiration to me.\\\\n    Thank you, and I look forward to answering any questions \\\\nyou may have.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Director Szczepanik can be found \\\\non page 70 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Director Gibson, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for \\\\nyour oral presentation.\\\\n\\\\n   STATEMENT OF MICHAEL S. GIBSON, DIRECTOR, SUPERVISION AND \\\\n REGULATION, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM \\\\n                             (FED)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Lynch, and \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to \\\\ndiscuss supervision and regulation as it relates to innovation \\\\nin the financial system.\\\\n    The Federal Reserve is committed to supporting responsible \\\\ninnovation, both by the firms we oversee directly and in the \\\\nfinancial system broadly. We recognize that innovation can \\\\nreinforce the safety and soundness of banks and the stability \\\\nof our financial system, increase operational efficiencies, and \\\\nreduce costs.\\\\n    However, innovation can also lead to risks, some of which \\\\nare familiar and others more novel. The Federal Reserve Board, \\\\nalongside the other Federal bank regulatory agencies, has a \\\\nstatutory responsibility to supervise banks to help ensure they \\\\noperate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with all \\\\napplicable laws. In keeping with that mission, we require the \\\\nbanks we oversee to identify and manage the risks associated \\\\nwith the new technologies they use.\\\\n    Our approach to supervising and regulating innovation in \\\\nbanking is based on the following overarching principles. \\\\nFirst, activities that present fundamentally the same risks \\\\nshould be regulated in the same way, regardless of where or how \\\\nthe activity occurs or the terms used to describe the activity.\\\\n    Second, the Federal Reserve has not taken and does not take \\\\na position on to whom banks can offer services so long as they \\\\nremain within the confines of the law. Banking organizations \\\\nare neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking \\\\nservices to customers of any specific class or type, as \\\\npermitted by law or regulation.\\\\n    Third, we have sought to be transparent about our \\\\nexpectations and approaches to novel activity supervision and \\\\nregulation to provide a pathway for responsible innovation.\\\\n    Finally, we recognize that we also must continue to learn, \\\\nwhich is why we engage in regular outreach.\\\\n    In keeping with these principles, the Federal Reserve \\\\nrecently announced the creation of a Novel Activities \\\\nSupervision Program to focus on the supervision of novel, \\\\ntechnology-driven activities at banks. These activities include \\\\nthose involving crypto assets, distributed ledger technology, \\\\nand complex, technology-driven bank partnerships with nonbank \\\\nfintechs, each of which I discuss further in my written \\\\ntestimony. By dedicating a team of supervisory experts to these \\\\nactivities, our aim is to provide clarity as well as timely, \\\\nconsistent, and relevant feedback to the institutions we \\\\nsupervise.\\\\n    The Federal bank regulatory agencies have also recently \\\\nissued guidance on third-party risk management, which lays out \\\\nthe agencies&#x27; supervisory expectations for all types of third-\\\\nparty relationships, including relationships with financial \\\\ntechnology companies.\\\\n    I would like to pivot now to artificial intelligence, which \\\\nbanks are leveraging for a variety of applications, such as \\\\nfraud monitoring and customer service. While the technology \\\\noffers several benefits, it also poses risks, including data \\\\nchallenges, explainability, bias, cybersecurity, and consumer \\\\nprotection. Federal Reserve staff continue to work closely with \\\\nthe other Federal bank regulatory agencies to track and learn \\\\nmore about emerging practices regarding banks&#x27; use of AI and \\\\nrelated risk management.\\\\n    Finally, it is important to note that innovation is not \\\\nconfined to the private sector. The Federal Reserve is focused \\\\non finding opportunities to use innovative technology to \\\\nenhance our supervision of the banking industry. We are \\\\nevaluating industry-leading technology to determine if adoption \\\\nof such tools will enhance our supervision technology and \\\\nincrease efficiency.\\\\n    The Federal Reserve is committed to supporting responsible \\\\ninnovation while also working to ensure that any risks \\\\nassociated with novel financial products and services are \\\\nproperly managed.\\\\n    Thank you. I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Director Gibson can be found on \\\\npage 43 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you very much.\\\\n    Ms. Epstein, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your \\\\noral remarks.\\\\n\\\\n    STATEMENT OF ANN EPSTEIN, ASSISTANT DIRECTER, OFFICE OF \\\\n   COMPETITION AND INNOVATION, CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION \\\\n                         BUREAU (CFPB)\\\\n\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. Good morning, Chairman Hill, Ranking Member \\\\nLynch, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank you \\\\nfor the opportunity to appear before you today.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s hearing is well-timed and critical, as innovation \\\\nis rapidly changing the competitive landscape, bringing new \\\\nopportunities and challenges for consumers, and financial \\\\nservices more holistically. A competitive and innovative \\\\nfinancial sector is critical for our economy, for our global \\\\ncompetitiveness, and to create choice for consumers. Advances \\\\nin technology can improve our lives when done within a vibrant, \\\\ncompetitive marketplace that maximizes consumer choice and \\\\nsafety.\\\\n    The CFPB has significantly ramped up efforts to facilitate \\\\nmarket competition to ensure that consumer financial markets \\\\nare fair, transparent, and competitive. The Office of \\\\nCompetition and Innovation is part of this broader initiative \\\\nto monitor for any obstacles to new entrants and to support \\\\ncompetition. I oversee this monitoring through conversations \\\\nwith many firms in the fintech ecosystem and through gathering \\\\ndata on new business models.\\\\n    When the CFPB first opened its doors just over a decade \\\\nago, technology companies in consumer finance were an emerging \\\\ntrend. They were an anomaly. The world has since evolved. \\\\nToday, many traditional financial services companies see \\\\nthemselves as technology companies, and large technology \\\\ncompanies, many with built-in customers and scale from other \\\\nbusiness lines, are providing consumer financial services, \\\\nparticularly in the payment space. Newer technologies, such as \\\\ngenerative AI, are increasingly being used to market financial \\\\nproducts and provide customer service, with potentially \\\\nunexpected outcomes. It is vitally important that we examine \\\\nwhat this means for consumers and for the industry.\\\\n    As technology has increased in importance, the CFPB has \\\\nexpanded our own in-house expertise. For example, we have added \\\\na chief technologist and developed a technologist program that \\\\nrecruits for technical expertise in areas such as data science, \\\\nAI and UX design, and embeds this expertise throughout the \\\\nCFPB.\\\\n    The CFPB is also playing a role in setting up new rules for \\\\nthe road in this landscape to ensure that the future state of \\\\nfinancial services is open to innovation. In October, the CFPB \\\\npublished a proposal for the Personal Financial Data Rights \\\\nRule, as required under Section 1033 of the Consumer Financial \\\\nProtection Act. We believe this rule, which would create new \\\\nstandards that facilitate sharing consumer financial data, will \\\\ncreate an environment in which new entrants can thrive, while \\\\nsimultaneously allowing consumers greater control and choice.\\\\n    We have also focused on ensuring that newer technologies \\\\nare used in ways that comply with existing laws. For example, \\\\nif AI is used in loan underwriting, it must confirm with \\\\nexisting rules that require lenders to provide consumers with \\\\nadverse action notices that explain reasons for loan denial. \\\\nWithout transparency, consumers cannot effectively protect \\\\ntheir rights and understand the reasons why they may have been \\\\ndeclined for credit. The requirement also plays a vital role in \\\\nhelping to detect and deter illegal discrimination.\\\\n    We also work to encourage the development of innovative new \\\\ntechnology products and services that will provide real value \\\\nto consumers. My office is running a tech sprint, where private \\\\ncompanies use data to build technology products, in this case \\\\nto help consumers make more-informed credit card choices. Tech \\\\nsprints are a tool used by the CFPB to foster the creation of \\\\nprivate tools and to get feedback from external parties.\\\\n    Two weeks ago, we announced that the CFPB would be working \\\\nwith the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) to \\\\ntest adjustments to mortgage disclosures in the unique context \\\\nof construction loans. This has potential benefits across the \\\\nhousing market, and in particular to Americans living in rural \\\\nareas where existing housing stock is often in scarce supply \\\\nand new homes are seldom built on spec, but rather require up-\\\\nfront capital from the borrower. Construction loan disclosures \\\\nhave historically been more oriented toward the purchase of \\\\nexisting homes that do not require significant funds for \\\\nrenovation.\\\\n    My office approved a proposal from the ICBA that will allow \\\\nlenders to apply to do in-market testing of these new \\\\ndisclosures. This is the first application under the trial \\\\ndisclosure policy and a great illustration of how we can work \\\\ntogether with industry to identify and address real market \\\\nneeds supporting American families and communities.\\\\n    Finally, I would like to highlight the importance of \\\\ncollaboration and consistency across the regulatory framework. \\\\nMy office chairs an organization called the American Consumer \\\\nFinancial Innovation Network, where we meet regularly with \\\\nStates on innovation topics. We are also a coordinating group \\\\nmember of the Global Financial Innovation Network. Along with \\\\nmost of the other regulators on this panel, we are able to \\\\nshare approaches to similar challenges with regulators across \\\\nthe globe.\\\\n    In summary, my office, and the CFPB as a whole, is focused \\\\non advancing a more sophisticated approach to competition and \\\\ninnovation in support of our statutory mission to ensure that \\\\nthe market for consumer financial services is fair, \\\\ntransparent, and competitive.\\\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you. I look \\\\nforward to responding to your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Assistant Director Epstein can \\\\nbe found on page 38 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you very much.\\\\n    And Mr. Mulholland, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nSTATEMENT OF MARK MULHOLLAND, DEPUTY CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER \\\\n  FOR MANAGEMENT, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Mulholland. Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Lynch, and \\\\nmembers of the subcommittee, I am pleased to appear before you \\\\ntoday at the hearing on, ``Fostering Financial Innovation: How \\\\nAgencies Can Leverage Technology to Shape the Future of \\\\nFinancial Services.&#x27;&#x27; My name is Mark Mulholland, and I am the \\\\nDeputy CIO for Management at the FDIC.\\\\n    I have worked for the Federal Government for more than 34 \\\\nyears, having started with the General Services Administration \\\\nin 1989. In 1996, I began working for the FDIC&#x27;s Office of \\\\nInspector General, where I performed audits of the FDIC&#x27;s \\\\nprograms and operations with a particular emphasis on \\\\ninformation technology and security. In August of 2021, I \\\\ntransferred to the FDIC&#x27;s Chief Information Officer \\\\nOrganization, or CIOO. In my current role, I oversee the CIOO&#x27;s \\\\nbudget and financial operations, procurement and contract \\\\nmanagement activities, internal review and risk management \\\\nprograms, and human resources management.\\\\n    The FDIC relies heavily on technology to carry out its core \\\\nmission of maintaining stability and public confidence in our \\\\nnation&#x27;s financial system. In 2023, the FDIC budgeted almost \\\\n$500 million to support the development, enhancement, \\\\nmodernization, and maintenance of its IT infrastructure systems \\\\nand data. IT modernization is a top priority at the FDIC. The \\\\nFDIC is currently implementing a multiyear IT modernization to \\\\nbrings its IT environment into alignment with modern IT \\\\npractices and standards, as well as with key Federal \\\\npriorities, including the Federal Cloud Smart Strategy.\\\\n    Under the IT modernization program the CIOO is working to \\\\nmigrate and modernize its systems and data from legacy, on-\\\\npremise data centers to cloud technology platforms that offer \\\\nenhanced IT capabilities, security, and resiliency. The IT \\\\nmodernization program includes an objective to modernize our \\\\nrisk management supervision and compliance examination business \\\\nprocesses and systems.\\\\n    In June of this year, the FDIC began operating the first \\\\nmajor supervisory application that supports consumer compliance \\\\nof Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) examinations in the cloud. \\\\nThe CIOO is also partnering with the FDIC&#x27;s Division of Risk \\\\nManagement Supervision on a new, multiyear effort to modernize \\\\nthe FDIC&#x27;s core risk management-related systems using cloud \\\\nsolutions.\\\\n    I also want to mention FDITECH, a key component within the \\\\nCIOO organization. FDITECH focuses on the adoption of \\\\ninnovative technologies within the FDIC itself. For example, \\\\nFDITECH is partnering with the Division of Risk Management \\\\nSupervision to expand the use of machine learning to analyze \\\\nreports of examinations and other information of individual \\\\ninstitutions to identify risks across the banking sector. \\\\nFDITECH is also evaluating the benefits and risks of potential \\\\napplications of distributed ledger technology both at the FDIC \\\\nand in the banking sector.\\\\n    Finally, the FDIC recognizes that financial technology \\\\ninnovation in the banking sector offers a number of important \\\\nand potential benefits such as enhanced operations, reduced \\\\ncosts, improved delivery of services, and greater financial \\\\ninclusion through expanded access to credit and other banking \\\\nservices. At the same time, technology innovation presents \\\\nrisks that financial institutions must effectively manage, such \\\\nas consumer protection, privacy, and data risks.\\\\n    To ensure the FDIC understands the benefits of financial \\\\ntechnology innovation and is prepared to address the associated \\\\nrisks, the FDIC routinely engages with industry stakeholders \\\\nthrough a number of channels. For example, the FDIC issues \\\\nperiodic requests for information about innovative \\\\ntechnologies, reviews the use of technology in individual banks \\\\nand select service providers through the examination process, \\\\nand discusses technology issues with bankers through such \\\\nforums as the FDIC Advisory Committee on Community Banking.\\\\n    The FDIC has also established various internal committees, \\\\nworking groups, and component organizations within the FDIC \\\\nthat focus on financial technologies. Collectively, these \\\\nactivities help to inform the FDIC&#x27;s supervisory strategies and \\\\nregulatory policymaking.\\\\n    That concludes my opening statement, and I would be happy \\\\nto answer any questions that you may have.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Deputy Chief Information Officer \\\\nMulholland can be found on page 49 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you very much for your testimony. We \\\\nwill now turn to Member questions, and I will recognize myself \\\\nfor 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Epstein, you referenced the Global Innovation Network, \\\\nand Ms. Szczepanik, you talked about sort of coordination \\\\nresponsibilities over at the Commission. Do the six of your \\\\noffices get together on a regular basis, not to talk about \\\\nglobal comparisons internationally and host a big meeting with \\\\na nice dinner, but do you meet on a regular basis about common \\\\ninnovation issues?\\\\n    Who wants to answer that question, or try to?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. I can start. Our offices and other parts of our \\\\nagencies meet on a regular basis.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. With a bias towards seeing how we can \\\\nadvance innovation.\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. With a discussion of how we can advance \\\\ninnovation, what risks we are seeing, what use cases we are \\\\nseeing in the industry, on both an internal basis and an \\\\nexternal basis.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. So, for example, Director Gibson, do any \\\\nexam preferences that you find from your Innovation Office get \\\\ncoordinated through the Financial Institutions Examination \\\\nCouncil (FFIEC) so that there is one approach to examining on \\\\nthese topics?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. We share a lot of information through FFIEC on \\\\nexamination procedures. On these particular topics, I would say \\\\nthe sharing is more from the staff who are specialists in \\\\ninnovation.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. You have issued this Novel Activities \\\\nSupervision rule, and I am curious, how do you see that \\\\nfostering innovation, Director Gibson?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. We did establish a Novel Activities Supervision \\\\nProgram earlier this year, and the goal is really to make sure \\\\nthat our examiners who are engaging with firms that are doing \\\\nthese innovative activities have the expertise and the training \\\\nin order to effectively supervise them, understand both the \\\\nbenefits that the firms are seeking with the innovative \\\\ntechnologies, and that the firms are managing the risks.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Mr. Vice, you have been a bank examiner for \\\\na long time, and then Kentucky Commissioner, so you have seen \\\\nthe good news and bad news out of bank examination out in the \\\\nreal world. Some of your colleagues here maybe have not had \\\\nthat great experience. Do you not think boards of directors \\\\nhave, under the CAMELS examination process, the responsibility \\\\nfor all of the things that are in the Novel Activities rule to \\\\njustify a third-party agreement, to have somebody do a website \\\\nor to solicit mortgage applications through an app? Do we not \\\\nalready have that? Is the Novel Activities rule really needed? \\\\nDo you not think boards have that responsibility?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. The board would be responsible for the operation \\\\nof the bank.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. And they are supposed to convince their \\\\nsupervisors that they have the right capital plan for that, the \\\\nright budget, and the right skills and abilities, right?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. I think it is incumbent upon the agency to make \\\\nsure that we have staff who are knowledgeable and experienced \\\\nto go in----\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Yes, I think the agencies have all done a \\\\ngood job over the last 25 years of training their own staff to \\\\ncome in and do an IT, internal-external penetration testing and \\\\nlook at due diligence files for fintech. That has been a big \\\\nimprovement by the agencies.\\\\n    I am very concerned that this rule, without real clarity, \\\\nis going to create more confusion, and the idea of \\\\npreauthorizing it to take on a task when it is not material to \\\\nthe bank, for example, in the judgment of the board, I think \\\\ncould be overkill.\\\\n    Director Gibson, could that create confusion and bog people \\\\ndown if it is not done right?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. I think there is always that potential, but we \\\\ndefinitely want to send skilled examiners to engage with boards \\\\nof directors and bank management so they can have a good \\\\ndialogue.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. On the third-party risk management \\\\nquestions, I thought it was good that you are meeting together \\\\nand working together on that as a group. But I am hearing \\\\nanecdotally from community banks, particularly, that they are \\\\nreceiving substantially more exam questions this year than they \\\\ndid in previous years.\\\\n    Director Gibson, have you heard that from your field \\\\nexaminers, bank comments in that vein?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. What we have heard is that given all the \\\\nturmoil in the banking industry this year, and the heightened \\\\nrisks, that we are definitely focusing on those risks, and \\\\nthose conversations have been taking place.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. You say, on page 7 of your guidance, that \\\\nagencies will develop additional resources to assist smaller, \\\\nnoncomplex community banks to manage third-party risk. When are \\\\nthose resources going to be published?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. Our staff are working on that, and we hope to \\\\npublish something soon, similar to what we have done with other \\\\nrules or guidance.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. So, you put out a rule, and you make people \\\\nresponsible for it, but do not first give them the guidance on \\\\nhow to comply with it. Is that how I should read that?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. We are definitely engaging with firms as the \\\\nguidance has come out, and we do hope to provide additional \\\\nresources very soon.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Good. I yield back the balance of my time.\\\\n    I now recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. \\\\nLynch, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you all \\\\nfor your service. I really do appreciate it. And thank you for \\\\nyour guidance.\\\\n    There is a dichotomy in the fintech world, and I suppose \\\\nthat applies to crypto as well. In finance, our institutions, \\\\nour banks are guided by--we have a rules-based system, right? A \\\\nlot of our financial statutes, our regulatory regimes, come out \\\\nof disasters. Mr. Mulholland, thousands of bank failures \\\\ncreated your agency, and Ms. Szczepanik, yours as well. The Fed \\\\nitself was created after the panic of 1907. So, we had \\\\nfinancial disasters, and then we had responding statutory \\\\nlanguage to try to correct that, and those experiences created \\\\nevery single one of your agencies.\\\\n    On the tech side, however, the motto for Mark Zuckerberg at \\\\nFacebook was, move fast and break things. That is not a good \\\\napproach for a bank. So, you have this clash of cultures. One \\\\nis rules-based, and the other one is, move fast and break \\\\nthings, and that is playing out in the fintech world. And it is \\\\ngoing to be a decision, at some point, of how do we blend those \\\\ntwo cultures in a way that protects consumers and depositors \\\\nand investors, yet allows us to adopt all of this innovation?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson, you have this new Office of--what is it called?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. The Novel Activities?\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Yes, I was looking for that--Novel Activities \\\\nSupervision Program, which aims to better supervise banks that \\\\nare engaging in novel activities. How are you evaluating the \\\\nrisks? We have seen some notable disasters. FTX was a complete \\\\ncollapse. Thankfully, 90-something percent of the investors \\\\nwere non-U.S. citizens, because they had to operate offshore, \\\\nso that was a success for our regulatory framework, I think. \\\\nBut how are we dealing with some of these risks, and how are we \\\\nevaluating those in real time?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. When banks are dealing with either complex \\\\nfintech partnerships or with crypto assets, some of these new \\\\nareas that post novel risks, as I said, there are definitely \\\\nsome benefits to the innovation that we can see, but there are \\\\nalso risks. Now, we are definitely seeing some of those risks \\\\nmaterialize with some of the complex arrangements that banks \\\\nare making with some of these fintech companies, and sometimes \\\\nthat has, in some cases, obscured the risk to the bank, because \\\\nthe fintech partner has the information about the end customer \\\\nthat the bank lacks. And in some cases, we have seen risks such \\\\nas Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) risks that \\\\nmaterialize when banks do not have strong information on their \\\\ncustomers. So, that is just one example of the risks that have \\\\nmaterialized.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. We do have a fair number of criminal activities \\\\nthat are favoring cryptocurrency, for example. We have a lot of \\\\nthese hacks by criminal operations that seek to be paid in \\\\ncryptocurrency. That seems to be a favorite use of that \\\\ntechnology. Is that guiding at all your approach to this?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. Banks themselves are not holding those crypto \\\\nassets, but banks have been dealing with crypto-related \\\\ncompanies, and we have seen risks such as liquidity risk. We \\\\nhave seen that the deposits from those crypto-related companies \\\\nhave been unpredictable, and that has caused risks to banking \\\\norganizations.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Yes. Explain to me how this office, this program \\\\nevaluates the technology itself, the architecture, and is that \\\\nexploration helpful given the fact that there are, I think, 130 \\\\ncountries out there that are exploring a CBDC right now?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. Our examiners are going to be focused on the \\\\nbank&#x27;s evaluation of the technology and whether the risks are \\\\nwell understood and managed. So, we are less into the details \\\\nof the technology as bank examiners; we are more into ensuring \\\\ncompliance with the laws and regulations.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. I see. Okay. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas of Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik, as you know, the SEC recently proposed a \\\\nrule regarding the use of predictive data analytics used by \\\\nbroker-dealers and investment advisors. Many respondents are \\\\nconcerned that the proposed rule is overly broad in what is \\\\nconsidered a covered technology. I quoted the rules definition \\\\nto SEC Chair Gensler during his appearance before this \\\\ncommittee: ``A covered technology is defined as an analytical \\\\ntechnology or computational function, an algorithm, model, \\\\ncorrelation matrix, or similar method or process that \\\\noptimizes, predicts, guides, forecasts, or directs investment \\\\nbehaviors and outcomes.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Could you discuss what your office&#x27;s role was in crafting \\\\nthis, what role you played?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Sure. Thank you. What the FinHub does is \\\\nact as a subject matter expert across the Commission, as the \\\\nCommission staff engages in various activities like rulemaking \\\\nor examination, policymaking or enforcement, as examples. So, \\\\nfor any particular rulemaking, the staff who are working on the \\\\nrule may come to the FinHub staff and ask us, how do particular \\\\nthings work, what is under the hood of this technology? Often, \\\\nwe find ourselves analyzing a certain blockchain, a smart \\\\ncontract, artificial intelligence, and how applications work, \\\\nand what those risks are, so we provide that subject matter \\\\nexpertise to the people working on the rulemaking.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. In your testimony, you described the necessary \\\\nbalance between fostering innovation and preventing harm. Can \\\\nyou discuss the potential negative consequences if the \\\\nfinancial regulators, or the SEC in particular, upset this \\\\nbalance by being hostile, so to speak, to certain kinds of \\\\ntechnology?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Sure. I think the agency&#x27;s approach, and \\\\nmany of the approaches probably of the folks here at the table, \\\\nis to get the right balance. We cannot have innovation happen \\\\nat the expense of investors or market integrity, so offices \\\\nlike the FinHub encourage people to come in and speak with us \\\\nabout how the Federal securities laws apply. For example, we do \\\\nnot give interpretations or legal advice but we can talk to \\\\nthem about risks that we see, or ask questions, or answer their \\\\nquestions about their projects.\\\\n    In that way, through that engagement, we hope to provide a \\\\nlittle bit of a platform for public and private engagement to \\\\nreach a level playing field, I think, where people understand \\\\nthis is what the innovation is trying to achieve, but the \\\\nregulatory agencies have missions and have very important \\\\npublic policy objectives to maintain.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Mr. Gibson, you outlined in your testimony how \\\\nbanks can benefit from generative AI, along with the associated \\\\nrisks. Could you discuss how your office coordinates with other \\\\nbank regulating agencies on AI and machine learning practices, \\\\nincluding how your office engages with agencies with \\\\ntechnological expertise, such as the National Institute of \\\\nStandards and Technology (NIST)?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. We do engage with other regulators and other \\\\nagencies, and with respect to NIST, they put out a lot of \\\\nstandards on technology that are very useful, and they tend to \\\\napply across the entire economy, and we tend to focus on the \\\\nfinancial sector. A lot of times, we are taking NIST standards \\\\nand seeing how they apply in the banking industry.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Speaking of NIST, in preparing for this hearing, \\\\nI was fascinated to come across the fact that in 1920, NIST \\\\nconducted extensive research on the design and construction of \\\\nyour Federal Reserve Bank vaults, including the gold vaults in \\\\nNew York City. I just found that to be fascinating, how a \\\\ncentury ago, we were engaged in that. And it&#x27;s an example of \\\\nhow when we bring experts from across the government together \\\\nto address complex challenges, the results really do stand the \\\\ntest of time.\\\\n    I would like to also focus and shift a bit to the CFPB&#x27;s \\\\napproach to emerging technology. Ms. Epstein, could you \\\\nidentify some of the actions taken by the CFPB&#x27;s Office of \\\\nCompetition and Innovation that have encouraged--let&#x27;s look at \\\\nthe positive side--companies to innovate?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. Sure. I had used, for example, a specific \\\\nexample in my testimony related to a tech sprint. This is our \\\\nfourth tech sprint that we are doing today. This particular \\\\ntech sprint is engaging with market participants to bring data \\\\nthat we have related to credit card terms and conditions to \\\\nencourage better consumer shopping. We know that we are not, as \\\\na Federal regulator, in the greatest position to bring that \\\\ndata to consumers, so we are engaging with the private \\\\nmarketplace to identify for them what market innovations could \\\\ncome from this particular data that we are putting out. It also \\\\nhelps us, because it gives us feedback as to how our data and \\\\nour technology that we use to produce this data is useful or \\\\nnot useful, is it the right latency, is it those kinds of \\\\nthings. That is one example. This is our fourth tech sprint, so \\\\nwe have done this on other occasions, for other types of tech \\\\nsprints, as well.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. My time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you, Mr. Lucas.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Thank you. Mr. Gibson, one of the functions of \\\\nthe Fed is to oversee the ACH system by which we wire money \\\\nfrom one account to another, and the greatest fear that you \\\\ncome up with whenever you are dealing with buying or selling a \\\\nhome is that the buyer will be tricked into sending the money \\\\nto the wrong account. People send an email to somebody. In \\\\neffect, their prospect of ever owning a home is on the line. \\\\nThey have their down payment, and they get an email saying, \\\\n``Send the money to account number 12345,&#x27;&#x27; and it is signed by \\\\ntheir escrow agent, and of course, it is phony, and the money \\\\nends up in the hands of a Nigerian prince.\\\\n    For about a decade, or the better part of a decade, I have \\\\nbeen asking Chairs of the Federal Reserve in this room to do \\\\nwhat Britain did quite some time ago, and that is have payee \\\\nmatching, so that when you send the money to an account, it \\\\nalso has a name. That would pretty much eliminate this \\\\npractice. For the better part of a decade, the Chairs of the \\\\nFed have said, ``We are not going to do that but we are doing \\\\nsomething else that will solve the problem.&#x27;&#x27; And then I ask \\\\nthem, ``What?&#x27;&#x27;, and they smile and walk away.\\\\n    When are we going to solve this problem, so that when you \\\\nwire money to account number 12345, it is supposed to be going \\\\nto Encino Escrow, and you are not tricked into using the wrong \\\\nnumber?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. I agree that sort of fraud is a problem.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Why do we not have a payee matching system? \\\\nWhy do we not have a system where, when you wire the money it \\\\nis to a person as well as an account? When I write a check, I \\\\nput the name of the payee on the check. I do not just write in \\\\na number. I know we are dealing with high technology here. This \\\\nis something we could have done in the last century. Why do we \\\\nnot have payee matching?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. I do not have the answer on this specific \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Okay. Well, neither has anyone else the last \\\\nfive times I have asked this question over the better part of \\\\nthis decade. Can you get me an answer?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. Yes, I am happy to work with you on that.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Have you done any calculation as to how much \\\\nharm is done by the present system versus the costs of doing \\\\nwhat the U.K. has done and have payee matching?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. Generally, in the area of fraud, we see a lot \\\\nof fraud taking place, and a lot of risk, and banks putting a \\\\nlot of----\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Why don&#x27;t you do something about it?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. We are happy to work with you on that specific \\\\nissue, and I----\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. I would believe you if your predecessor&#x27;s \\\\npredecessor--if Fed officials had not been telling me that for \\\\nthe last 10 years and then not doing anything. And them working \\\\non consists of telling me, ``Oh, well, we know the problem and \\\\nwe will get back to you.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Let&#x27;s talk about this every week. I look forward to your \\\\ncall next week, and every week until we solve this problem. \\\\nThis is just crazy.\\\\n    Now, I will turn to the bank regulators. If you make an \\\\nunsecured loan to an individual, you evaluate that in one way, \\\\nas a bank asset, another way if it is a loan secured by \\\\nvaluable assets, such as Fortune 500 stock. If a loan is \\\\nsecured by crypto, is that viewed as an unsecured loan or is \\\\nthat security regarded as valuable? I will ask Ms. Murphy.\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. In that kind of circumstance that you describe, \\\\nwe would have to look at the specifics of the loan. There is \\\\nvery, very limited activity of that type in the national \\\\nbanking system.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. You are saying banks do not make loans secured \\\\nby crypto accounts?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. In order to engage in that type of activity, \\\\nour banks would have to engage with their examiners, and there \\\\nis very limited activity----\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. What do your examiners do? Do they value it as \\\\na fully secured loan or a completely unsecured loan if it is \\\\nsecured by Bitcoin or Hamster coin, or do you just not know?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. I am not aware of a specific instance where we \\\\nhave valued loans in that way, and I would have to get back to \\\\nyou about that.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Please do get back to me.\\\\n    I will ask the same question of Mr. Mulholland, and I will \\\\nalso ask whether any of the FDIC-insured banks hold crypto as \\\\nan asset on their balance sheet for which you give them credit?\\\\n    Mr. Mulholland. Thank you for the question, Congressman. \\\\nThe FDIC and the other regulators have issued guidance with \\\\nrespect to holding, as principal, crypto assets and using those \\\\nas a principal for lending activities, and cautionary language.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Do you list it as an asset, based on its \\\\nsupposed value today?\\\\n    Mr. Mulholland. I am actually working in the CIOO \\\\norganization, so I am not on the supervision----\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. So, you also do not know the answer to that.\\\\n    Mr. Mulholland. But I would be happy to get back to you.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Next, the gentleman who wants very badly for Army to beat \\\\nNavy this weekend, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Davidson, who \\\\nis also the Vice Chair of our subcommittee, is recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our \\\\nwitnesses for being here today.\\\\n    Mr. Gibson, I did a quick Google search for open jobs at \\\\nthe Federal Reserve, and the regional banks are using the \\\\nkeyword, ``CBDC,&#x27;&#x27; or key acronym. It looks like the San \\\\nFrancisco Fed and the Boston Fed are hiring for CBDC \\\\ndevelopment roles, programmers. Can you provide an update for \\\\nthe panel on the Federal Reserve&#x27;s development of a United \\\\nStates central bank digital currency?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. The Federal Reserve is doing research on CBDC \\\\ntechnologies, trying to understand the technologies themselves \\\\nand how they might be useful. It is research and \\\\nexperimentation at this point, and it is not an implementation \\\\nof a CBDC.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. When you hire people who write code, it \\\\nstarts seeming like you are developing and building versus \\\\nresearching. What is the nature of the research--we are going \\\\nto build it and test fire it and see how it works?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. I think the research is to understand the \\\\ntechnology, understand the different approaches that people are \\\\ntalking about, understand the risks. It is a research effort.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. Near implementation, but we will run it for a \\\\nwhile and see if it really works, or are you building something \\\\nthat would be functional, or it is just research?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. We are a long way off from thinking about the \\\\nimplementation of anything related to a CBDC.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. Thank you. Mr. Gibson, I sent a letter to Fed \\\\nChair Powell regarding Custodia Bank&#x27;s denial of a master \\\\naccount for, ``Custodia Bank proposed to engage in novel and \\\\nuntested crypto activities that include issuing crypto assets \\\\non an open, public, and/or decentralized network.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Shortly after this denial, the Fed created what has been \\\\nreferenced several times now, the Novel Activities Supervision \\\\nProgram, to focus on digital assets, projects using distributed \\\\nledger technology, and bank-fintech partnerships. This program \\\\nstarted in August, and I am curious if you could give us an \\\\nupdate on the activities there?\\\\n    I will say, I would also like to know how the discovery \\\\nprocess is going, because I took the rare step of joining an \\\\namicus brief of a company because, technically, Custodia met \\\\nevery element of the stated requirement for a master account, \\\\nand they even promised to hold 108 percent of the assets on the \\\\nbooks. They were not lending against the assets. They simply \\\\nwanted to provide custody for the assets, thus the name, \\\\nCustodia.\\\\n    Have you done any work to figure out how there is risk \\\\ninvolved in essentially a trust company holding with reserves \\\\nbeyond the value of the assets? Have you solved it?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. In terms of terms that we are actually \\\\nsupervising, we are definitely looking at the risks of their \\\\nactivities, and----\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. But you have chosen not to supervise the ones \\\\nthat are actually working in fintech. Essentially, you have \\\\nsaid, ``It is a big club, and you are not in it, so don&#x27;t ask \\\\nagain.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. If you are asking about the Custodia \\\\napplication, the board did evaluate that application against \\\\nthe statutory factors and the board&#x27;s order on Custodia is \\\\npublic. The order explains the findings on the statutory \\\\nfactors.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. It is similar. The OCC made progress. \\\\nAnchorage is in, but nobody else. Essentially, it is a club you \\\\nare not in. Have you solved this riddle as to how somebody can \\\\nprovide custody for an asset, not lending against it, just \\\\ncustody? Has anyone figured this out? Because the market has, \\\\nbut the regulators have not.\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. If that is a question for me, I would say that \\\\nwe have been looking at this issue. Obviously, we do have one \\\\nbank that has been chartered with that as a primary business \\\\nmodel. And one of the things that is challenging in that area \\\\nis compliance with the anti-money laundering laws and \\\\nregulations. There is a lot of progress being made there, \\\\nthrough financial technology innovations----\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. It seems that it would be easier to track \\\\nsomething that is on a public blockchain than something that is \\\\nmoving through swift accounts. It is similar kinds of \\\\ninstructions.\\\\n    The market really understands this. I am disappointed that \\\\nthe regulators have essentially decided in Choke Point 2.0, \\\\n3.0, 20.0, whatever, but basically, you guys are not playing.\\\\n    I am curious about the FDIC&#x27;s approach to third-party risk \\\\nmanagement. Mr. Mulholland, you talked about it in your opening \\\\nremarks and in one question. But how are traditional financial \\\\ninstitutions, third-party risk management processes being \\\\nexamined, particularly with respect to fintech, and is there \\\\nany difference between normal activities and fintech \\\\npartnerships?\\\\n    Mr. Mulholland. Thank you for the question, Congressman. \\\\nYes, I did mention the third-party guidance and also due \\\\ndiligence guidance that has been issued by the regulatory \\\\nagencies to help assist banks in doing selection for third \\\\nparties, such as fintechs, as well as the ongoing monitoring to \\\\nensure----\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. Yes, my time has expired, and I apologize for \\\\nleaving you too little time to respond, but I would love to \\\\nfollow up with you on that. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Mulholland. Certainly. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. If you could respond to the gentleman&#x27;s \\\\nquestion in writing, that would be very helpful to him.\\\\n    We now turn to Mr. Casten of Illinois for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Thank you, Chairman Hill, and to all of our \\\\nwitnesses here today.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik, I hope you will humor me. I want to get \\\\nkind of nerdy here, and hopefully, I do not get too far in the \\\\nweeds. There was some reporting that Chair Gensler, last July, \\\\nhad indicated that the SEC should consider the use of AI for \\\\ncompliance and regulation. In September, Chair Gensler \\\\ntestified to the Senate that the SEC is using AI models to do \\\\nmarket surveillance. And I am wondering if you could just speak \\\\nbriefly to how the SEC is using AI right now, and specifically, \\\\nhow you are sort of training datasets on AI to think about \\\\nthat--briefly, because I want to dig into some other points?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Sure, and there are some materials on our \\\\nwebsite, at FinHub&#x27;s website, talking about how the Commission \\\\nstaff has used AI in the past, typically things like natural \\\\nlanguage processing and machine learning to analyze datasets \\\\nand market data and other data to, for example, flag \\\\naberrations or trends to inform what the Commission staff is \\\\ndoing across-the-board.\\\\n    I will note that there is pending guidance that we are \\\\nawaiting from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that \\\\nwill come out to give guidance to the agencies throughout the \\\\ngovernment about the internal use of AI, and we will be \\\\nmonitoring the progress of that guidance and incorporating that \\\\ngoing forward.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. And are you making public what datasets you are \\\\nusing to train the AI?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. To my knowledge, that is not public, but I \\\\ncan follow up with you.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay, and that is not a leading question--I do \\\\nnot know if it should be or not. But I ask because there has \\\\nbeen some reporting of private sector actors who are now using \\\\nAI to do it. I think there is a risk thinking AI in Bloomberg \\\\nthat are putting this model sort of in anticipation of some \\\\nclimate disclosure rules, looking at big datasets.\\\\n    And what I am wondering--and I am not expecting you to \\\\ncomment on the climate disclosure rules right now--but to the \\\\nextent those models are using the same datasets that your \\\\nmodels are using, that would seem to be mutually beneficial for \\\\ncompliance. To the extent they are different, it would seem to \\\\ncreate headaches. And I am just wondering what you are thinking \\\\nabout that?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Sure. What I can say is that in FinHub, we \\\\ntypically try to bring the people in who are producing new \\\\ntypes of technology so that we understand how it is being used, \\\\nwhat it is capable of, how our registrant population may use \\\\nit, how investors might use it, and how fraudsters might use \\\\nit.\\\\n    That is the type of outreach and learning we are going \\\\nthrough now with respect to this new generative AI. And as I \\\\nmentioned before, our internal use will be guided by future \\\\nguidance and we will be monitoring and evaluating that guidance \\\\ngoing forward.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay. I raised the climate piece, number one, \\\\nbecause I am a broken record on climate, but also because it \\\\nstrikes me that if we think about this as looking for market \\\\nmanipulation, things people normally think the SEC does, I \\\\nsuppose that data is--not to oversimplify--available to anybody \\\\nwho has a Bloomberg terminal and can plug in the data. But as \\\\nwe get to responsibilities that you have to have companies \\\\naccurately reporting risks and using other public databases, \\\\nthere is this whole rich, ethical conversation we are having \\\\nabout who is vetting the databases, and is there a single \\\\ndatabase, and who is preparing those, and who is making sure \\\\nthe data is good.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Yes, and that is something that our Chair \\\\nis keenly focused on, and he has talked about how he believes \\\\nthat this technology is transformative but also carries with it \\\\nsome risks, and those risks, as you mentioned, have to do with \\\\nbias, explainability, how robust is the model, how can it be \\\\nused to deceive, is it being used in a way that is creating \\\\nconflicts of interest? These are all things that the staff is \\\\nreally going to be focused on, and me, as the Director of \\\\nFinHub.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Yes, and a rich conversation about the ethics. \\\\nI am focused on the datasets just because you can run different \\\\nmodels on the same dataset and hopefully, if the models are \\\\ngood, get consistent answers, but if the datasets are \\\\ndifferent, there is conflict.\\\\n    Just the last thing on that point. The Chair has warned the \\\\nfinancial institutions that they are going to rely on a limited \\\\nnumber of AI platforms, but I think he has been very open, and \\\\nI think very thoughtful, about saying that your regulation is \\\\nat the level of a given entity, but if those entities are now \\\\nrelying on a single set of cross-company platforms, if the \\\\nproblem is with that platform, do you all have the tools to \\\\nassess these questions? Do you need help from Congress? How are \\\\nyou thinking about this question, if there is dataset \\\\nintegrity, from ethics or otherwise, and it spans a lot of \\\\ndifferent companies?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. I think you have identified one of the \\\\nissues that the Chair has raised about micro concerns and macro \\\\nconcerns. This macro concern about concentrations and what can \\\\nhappen if everyone is using the same dataset or there is \\\\nherding behavior, that is something that the staff will be \\\\nlooking at closely as well.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay. I hear the tapping that I am out of time.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. I yield back. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The Chair now recognizes the Majority Whip \\\\nof the House, Mr. Emmer, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to our \\\\nwitnesses for joining us today.\\\\n    When Bill Hinman was the Director of the SEC&#x27;s Division of \\\\nCorporation Finance, he gave a speech on June 14, 2018, \\\\nentitled, ``Digital Transactions: When Howie Met Gary.&#x27;&#x27; In \\\\nthis speech, he famously discussed how tokens can morph from \\\\nsecurities to non-securities, and he stated that Ether is not a \\\\nsecurity.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik, you reviewed and commented on drafts of \\\\nthis speech, did you not?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Yes, I did.\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. When reviewing a draft, you said that providing, \\\\n``less detail,&#x27;&#x27; in the speech was better because the concept \\\\nof a token morphing from a security to a nonsecurity was a new \\\\nconcept and would generate a lot of discussion. Do I have that \\\\ncorrect?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. I believe so.\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. So, you thought the SEC should give less clarity \\\\nto the market rather than more. I understand you thought the \\\\ntoken morphing concept would generate a lot of discussion, but \\\\nwhen the industry complains about a lack of clarity, I see it \\\\nwas a deliberate policy preference. Does the current SEC Chair \\\\nshare that view?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. I cannot really testify about the current \\\\nChair&#x27;s view. What I can say is that the determination whether \\\\nany particular asset is a security is a facts- and \\\\ncircumstances-based determination. And what I do, as the \\\\nDirector of FinHub, with my staff, is to provide facts to the \\\\nfolks at the SEC who are making that determination, and it is \\\\ntypically going to be the Division of Corporation Finance.\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. Reclaiming my time, because that is a perfect \\\\nsegue, has FinHub issued any guidance since Chair Gensler took \\\\noffice, to clarify how the securities laws apply to crypto?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. As I mentioned, FinHub&#x27;s role is really to \\\\nbe a subject matter expert.\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. Reclaiming my time, ma&#x27;am, I am asking a very \\\\nspecific question. Has FinHub issued any guidance?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. FinHub typically gets involved with other \\\\ndivisions and offices at the agency who are issuing \\\\nstatements----\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. Reclaiming my time, I take it the answer is no, \\\\nbecause it is no. It seems to be rulemaking through enforcement \\\\naction.\\\\n    In his speech, Mr. Hinman announced that Ether was not a \\\\nsecurity, is not a security. Is that your view today?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. I cannot comment on a particular asset.\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. Just to back up for a second, you provided \\\\nfeedback on the speech, and so did Brett Redfearn, who was then \\\\nthe Director of the SEC&#x27;s Division of Trading and Markets. Yet, \\\\nfirst, the SEC argued in court that the speech was Mr. Hinman&#x27;s \\\\nown personal opinion. Then, the SEC argued that the speech was \\\\nthe opinion of only the Division of Corporation Finance, which \\\\nMr. Hinman led.\\\\n    But why would people across the SEC, from FinHub to the \\\\nDivision of Trading and Markets, comment on a speech that has \\\\nthe views of only one person or only one division? That does \\\\nnot make any sense.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. I hope you can appreciate that I cannot \\\\ncomment on pending matters that are in litigation or \\\\ninvestigation.\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. Okay. Fair enough. The Southern District of New \\\\nYork even called the SEC&#x27;s arguments hypocrisy, that the SEC \\\\nwould argue that the speech is not relevant to the market&#x27;s \\\\nunderstanding of how the SEC will regulate crypto, while it is \\\\na fact that Mr. Hinman obtained legal advice from SEC counsel \\\\nin drafting his speech.\\\\n    The court said the SEC is adopting its litigation positions \\\\nto further its desired goal and not out of faithful allegiance \\\\nto the law. That is what all of us in Congress have seen, that \\\\nthe SEC is not adhering to the law. That is why it keeps losing \\\\nin court.\\\\n    Does the Chair of the SEC tell you to adopt positions to \\\\nfurther a specific goal, his own personal goal, rather than \\\\nallegiance to the law?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Again, I cannot comment on any matters that \\\\nare pending in litigation, but I will say that----\\\\n    Mr. Emmer. I do appreciate it. I reclaim my time. I think \\\\nyou answered the question.\\\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my \\\\ntime.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from Illinois, Dr. Foster, is recognized for \\\\n5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Thank you, Chairman Hill, for hosting this \\\\nhearing and to our witnesses for joining us today.\\\\n    Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence present \\\\nnew opportunities to make our financial system more secure, \\\\ninclusive, and efficient. They also present new risks that, if \\\\nnot mitigated, can be a threat to consumers and the U.S. \\\\neconomy. One of the most immediate of those threats is that \\\\ndeep fakes created with generative AI models can mimic an \\\\nindividual&#x27;s appearance or voice. This makes scammers much more \\\\nconvincing and makes it harder for financial institutions to \\\\nverify the identities of their customers.\\\\n    Now, countries like India, Estonia, Korea--there is a long \\\\nlist--have taken national steps to provide citizens who wish \\\\nwith a secure form of digital identification that could be \\\\npresented online. A secure digital ID, biometrically synced to \\\\nyour smartphone, allows individuals to remotely verify that \\\\nthey are who they say they are, saving costs, reducing the \\\\nlikelihood of fraud, and allowing individuals to defend \\\\nthemselves against deep fake identity fraud.\\\\n    Mr. Vice, in your testimony you mentioned that the NCUA is \\\\nevaluating digital ID technology and that, in fact, some credit \\\\nunions have completed successful pilot tests of this \\\\ntechnology. Could you describe the experience of the credit \\\\nunions that you referenced? For example, were the credit unions \\\\nable to streamline the process of onboarding new members?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. Again I would be reporting what they have \\\\nreported to me, but it gives them a secure method to identify \\\\nand certify someone&#x27;s identification, and it reduces the time \\\\nto onboard.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Yes. For example, if this was in place during \\\\nCOVID, when we had to onboard massive numbers of unbanked \\\\ncustomers, but the customers had had a secure digital ID, would \\\\nthat have been a big improvement in our response to COVID?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. One of the things that I was very amazed with \\\\nduring the COVID period was how advanced technology had become \\\\nto be able to offer financial services to individuals. As long \\\\nas the tool was used properly, it could have been a help.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. The mobile ID rollout in the United States has \\\\nbeen fragmented, with some States moving much faster than \\\\nothers to adopt the technology. Have you identified any \\\\nbarriers that are keeping States from adopting this technology, \\\\nand do you see a use in national standards to promote this?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. That would be a State decision that the NCUA \\\\nwould not be involved with, but definitely pointing to NIST, \\\\nand the standards have been established by NIST on the digital \\\\nidentification.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Yes. Do any of our other witnesses have any \\\\ncomments on this area, the utility of a national standard for a \\\\nsecure digital ID provided by States?\\\\n    No one is jumping for the microphone. Okay.\\\\n    Ms. Epstein, several States, including Arizona, Colorado, \\\\nMaryland, and Georgia, currently issue mobile IDs attached to \\\\ntheir smartphone. Has the CFPB received any requests from \\\\nfinancial institutions regarding the use of the mobile ID for \\\\nidentity verification in consumer finance?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. I am not aware of any particular request.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Okay. And do you believe that a secure digital \\\\nID might protect consumers and save them time when addressing \\\\nareas such as consumer online transactions and so on?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. I think we have certainly seen, in our \\\\nconsumer complaint database and other forums, that scammers and \\\\nother types of identity theft continue to be issue throughout. \\\\nSo to an extent, that would be helpful, but I do not have any \\\\nparticular----\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Specific things. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. Vice, the NCUA has long advocated for restoration of \\\\nits statutory authority over third-party vendors providing \\\\nservices to federally-insured credit unions. Our office has \\\\nbeen trying to get some action on this for a long time, with \\\\nlimited success. But just a few days ago, what we worried about \\\\nactually happened. Roughly 60 credit unions experienced outages \\\\nwhen a shared third-party vendor was hacked by cyber criminals, \\\\nand because of Congress&#x27; inaction on this, you do not have the \\\\nauthority you need to make sure the cyber hygiene was what it \\\\nshould be.\\\\n    Does the NCUA have a regulatory blind spot in that you \\\\ncannot oversee these third-party vendors, and what can we, in \\\\nCongress, do to help?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. Yes. It definitely has a regulatory blind spot. \\\\nOur Chair has asked for this authority. The GAO has also \\\\nrecommended that the NCUA should have it, in addition to our \\\\nown Inspector General. And one of the things that was talked \\\\nabout at the very beginning of this is, do we coordinate with \\\\neach other, and because we do not have that third-party vendor \\\\nauthority, in many instances, when things come up we, do not \\\\nhave a seat at that table because of the lack of authority.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Thank you. My time is up. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Rose, is recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you, Chairman Hill, and thank you, Ranking \\\\nMember Lynch, for holding this important hearing today. And I \\\\nwant to take this opportunity to wish Chairman Hill a Happy \\\\nBirthday.\\\\n    Mr. Vice, the NCUA established the Office of Financial \\\\nTechnology and Access earlier this year, which you lead. While \\\\nyour office is still relatively new, can you speak about what \\\\nyou have done over the past year and what your office hopes to \\\\naccomplish within the next year?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. From a big-picture perspective, I think some of \\\\nthe things we have talked about already are very important, and \\\\nthat is there is a balance between the use of technology--\\\\ntechnology is a tool, how it is used, is it used in a positive \\\\nmanner, is it used to enhance member experience and service and \\\\noffering fair, equitable service--but there are also some risks \\\\nassociated with it. We want to take a look at both the balance \\\\nof what technology needs to be adopted, having a lot of \\\\nconversations with not only the credit union industry but also \\\\nthe technology industry as well, and then making sure that is \\\\nbalanced to make sure that the credit union industry remains \\\\nsafe and sound.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Based on your progress so far, would you say that \\\\nyou are reactive or being proactive about new technology in \\\\nthis space?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. My opinion is that I am very proactive.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Okay. Can you give us an example of something you \\\\nhave done that you believe is proactive?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. There are a couple of things that we are looking \\\\nat, but I have had many conversations with the industry itself, \\\\nwith technology companies. One of the things that our board \\\\nmember started before I got there, but we are continuing, is to \\\\nhave a fintech series where we invite fintech companies in to \\\\nthe NCUA to do a virtual presentation on their technology, how \\\\nit is being used, and how it is being used to enhance member \\\\nservices and financial inclusion.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Would you say that the attitude of your office at \\\\nthis juncture is to try to facilitate implementation of new \\\\ntechnologies, or do you approach them in a more circumspect \\\\nway?\\\\n    Mr. Vice. Our approach, because of the size of our office, \\\\nis to make sure that we are having an impact, that we are \\\\nhaving relevance, and that we are collaborating; I think our \\\\nmain focus is those three things, plus maintaining that \\\\nbalance.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you. Ms. Murphy, last year, the OCC \\\\nsolicited academic and policy-focused research on the impact of \\\\nfintech entities on banking and the markets for lending, \\\\ndeposit taking, and payment services. Do you believe that a \\\\nconstructive dialogue with the financial industry is a good way \\\\nto stay informed on new developments?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. Yes, I do.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. And does your office prioritize input from \\\\nstakeholders when considering how to approach and regulate \\\\nfinancial innovations?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. Yes, we do.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Can you give me an example of how that has led to \\\\na productive outcome?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. The Office of Financial Technology regularly \\\\nengages with stakeholders across the industry, including both \\\\nfintech companies, banks we supervise, consumer advocates, and \\\\nacademics, as you mentioned, and we disseminate and make sure \\\\nthat information is used to support our policymaking and \\\\nguidance. For example, in the recent third-party risk \\\\nmanagement guidance that was produced, the Office of Financial \\\\nTechnology was supportive of the part of the agency that had a \\\\nlead on that.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Kind of playing off of the question I asked Mr. \\\\nVice, do you think that the posture of the agencies should be \\\\nto be reactive to new developments or to be proactive in \\\\nhastening their adoption?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. I think it has to be a balance between the two. \\\\nWe are proactive in reaching out and engaging and ensuring that \\\\nwe are keeping up with what is happening in the industry. It is \\\\na constantly-evolving process. But we are also reacting to what \\\\nis going on in terms of our banks&#x27; approach, their supervisory \\\\nteams, and we support their efforts to explore innovation, \\\\nexplore new financial technology, and then help to ensure that \\\\nthey are identifying the risks and managing the risks that are \\\\nassociated with it.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Based on what you have seen so far, what scares \\\\nyou the most, from a regulatory perspective, that you see \\\\nhappening in the fintech innovation space?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. I think that the challenges in the cybercrime \\\\narea are the ones that we are most concerned about. The \\\\ncriminals are constantly evolving their technology approaches, \\\\nand there is a need for the regulators to be constantly \\\\nvigilant, which we are, and we are very much coordinated on an \\\\ninteragency basis in that area.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. And in keeping with that observation, do you \\\\nthink the OCC has the resources it needs to stay ahead of the \\\\nfraudsters?\\\\n    Ms. Murphy. We are constantly updating and evolving our \\\\nresources. The challenges continue to change, and we continue \\\\nto change with it, and I think we have good programs in place \\\\nto make that happen.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Nickel, is \\\\nrecognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thank you, Chairman Hill. Happy Birthday. Also, \\\\nthanks to Ranking Member Lynch.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik, as you know, I am the Democratic lead on \\\\nthe Improving Disclosure for Investors Act, or eDelivery, which \\\\npassed out of this committee with bipartisan support and would \\\\nmake it easier for investors to receive documents \\\\nelectronically. This is a much-needed innovation for consumers, \\\\nbusinesses, and the environment.\\\\n    We would save two million trees a year with just that one \\\\nsmall change. In recent years, numerous government agencies \\\\nhave made great strides in minimizing wasteful paper usage. As \\\\nfar back as 2016, the Social Security Administration eliminated \\\\npaper as the primary method of delivering statements to \\\\nAmericans. In 2020, the Department of Labor permitted e-\\\\ndelivery of 401(k) documents to retirement plan participants. \\\\nIn 2023, the Thrift Savings Plan defaulted to electronic \\\\ndelivery of quarterly statements. And the IRS, through its \\\\nrecent Paperless Processing Initiative, as required under the \\\\nInflation Reduction Act, has already achieved the goal of \\\\nenabling 94 percent of filers to send tax documents digitally.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik, knowing that an overwhelming majority, 79 \\\\npercent, of retail investors have opted to receive investment-\\\\nrelated documents electronically, can you please explain why \\\\nthe SEC&#x27;s rules still require an investor to receive paper \\\\ndocuments when they open new investment accounts, and why has \\\\nyour office not pushed to update these rules?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Thanks for the question, and I agree that \\\\nevolving technologies can present new ways to have investors \\\\ninterface with the markets, including with issuers and funds, \\\\nfor example. At the FinHub, we invite people to come in. We \\\\nhave had what we call peer-to-peer meetups, and these are \\\\nevents where we pull people in to talk about innovations in \\\\nparticular areas. One of those areas was in investor engagement \\\\nand investor connectedness to the markets and issuers.\\\\n    We will continue to pull people in and try to talk about \\\\nnew technologies in this area and invite staff around the \\\\nCommission who are thinking about things like disclosure by \\\\nissuers or funds as they think about potential rulemakings or \\\\nchanges to the rules of the Commission.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thank you for your answer, but with respect, I \\\\nam just a little incredulous at your response and what the SEC \\\\nis doing here. You are the Director of the Strategic Hub for \\\\nInnovation and Financial Technology. eDelivery was considered \\\\nan innovation years ago. I would argue that your office is \\\\nbehind at the expense of investors and our planet. Why are you \\\\nnot focused specifically on this issue?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. The FinHub is not a policymaking part of \\\\nthe agency, nor is it a rulemaking part. We provide the subject \\\\nmatter expertise to others at the agency, so I will have to \\\\nrespectfully defer to them.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Do you think we should be using eDelivery \\\\ninstead of paper?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. As I said, there are many technologies that \\\\nwe are evaluating as they are coming to market, and we will \\\\ncontinue to do that.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. I am also concerned about the SEC&#x27;s proposed \\\\nrule on predictive data analytics and the adverse effects it \\\\nwill have on innovation and retail investors. The proposal&#x27;s \\\\nscope is extremely broad and could be applied to virtually any \\\\ntechnology used by broker-dealers and investment advisors. The \\\\nproposed rule seeks to eliminate the risk of investor harm \\\\nresulting from conflicts of interest between financial \\\\ninstitutions and clients when working with AI. I agree, and I \\\\nthink that is a great goal, but this the scope, this proposal \\\\nwould lead to higher costs for brokers and advisors, which will \\\\nbe passed along to investors, and fewer technology and online \\\\ntools for investors and lower rates of retail participation and \\\\nfinancial inclusion.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik, how involved was your office in creating \\\\nthis rule?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. As I said, when rulemaking is undertaken by \\\\nthe staff at the Commission, by the various divisions that \\\\nundertake rulemaking, the FinHub is often called on to talk \\\\nabout the technology being considered. So, we would provide \\\\ntechnical assistance to staff working on rules about emerging \\\\ntechnologies, how they work, how they are being used in the \\\\nmarket, and what risks they might present.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. We have seen the reports explaining that the \\\\nU.S. blockchain developer market is shrinking and that China is \\\\nquickly advancing. The U.S. must remain the global leader in \\\\nall segments of financial services, including digital assets. \\\\nThis technology moving overseas only puts U.S. consumers at \\\\nrisk.\\\\n    In your role at FinHub, are you doing anything to promote \\\\ninnovation in blockchain technologies here in the United \\\\nStates?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Sure. We promote innovation in a number of \\\\nways. One of them is to invite folks like entrepreneurs, \\\\ninnovators, and their advisors to come talk to the staff about \\\\nissues they are facing, including in digital asset, distributed \\\\nledger technology. We also do a number of outreach events, \\\\ngoing to industry conferences, tech sprints, build-a-thons, \\\\nthat kind of thing, to encourage beneficial innovation.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. My time has expired, and I will follow up in \\\\nwriting.\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. Thank you, Mr. Nickel. Your time has \\\\nexpired.\\\\n    Now, we turn to the gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Flood, for \\\\n5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Also, Happy Birthday \\\\nfrom everybody in Nebraska.\\\\n    I would like to focus my questions today on the Federal \\\\nReserve&#x27;s Novel Activities Program. This supervision program \\\\napplies to all banks that are members of the Federal Reserve \\\\nSystem, regardless of size. The Federal Reserve would require \\\\nState member banks to go through a supervisory, nonobjection \\\\nprocess in order to issue stablecoins or custody digital \\\\nassets.\\\\n    I specifically have interest in this topic and this program \\\\nbecause I wrote and passed legislation in Nebraska, as a State \\\\nSenator there, that would allow State-chartered banks to \\\\ncustody digital assets, and legislation that would also allow \\\\nState-chartered banks to issue stablecoins. The Federal Reserve \\\\nhas published five broad parameters it will use to determine \\\\nthe relative risk of these activities.\\\\n    I would like to start with a kudos, and a thank you. I \\\\nreached out to Kelly Lammers, the Director of the Nebraska \\\\nDepartment of Banking and Finance, in advance of this hearing, \\\\nand he assured me that he has been in very productive \\\\nconversations with the Federal Reserve on the Novel Activities \\\\nProgram. I thank you for maintaining an open dialogue with the \\\\nState of Nebraska. I am exceptionally proud of our Department \\\\nof Banking and Finance, and Nebraska is a leader on this issue. \\\\nDr. Gibson, I thank you.\\\\n    Just to kind of get into the questions here, the Nebraska \\\\nDepartment of Banking and Finance has already issued several \\\\nexamination manuals that walk through how to comply with State \\\\nlaw in great detail. They know these issues very well, and they \\\\nare already working on solutions that create a pathway for \\\\ninnovation, while also ensuring the safety and soundness of the \\\\nbanks in our State.\\\\n    Dr. Gibson, can banks expect further guidance on exactly \\\\nhow the Federal Reserve non-objection process will work, and \\\\nwill more guidance and examination manuals be issued, and will \\\\nthose be publicly available?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. All of our examination materials are publicly \\\\navailable, and we have issued guidance and statements around \\\\nthe supervisory nonobjection process to try to make it clear to \\\\nfirms, if they want to investigate that or undertake that \\\\nactivity, what are the steps they can go through. And we do \\\\npartner with the States, because as the supervisor of State \\\\nmember banks, we are always in partnership with the State \\\\nsupervisor on our examinations and our oversight.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Do you foresee more guidance coming out, or is \\\\nthe Federal Reserve pretty confident with what it has right \\\\nnow?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. We are always looking at areas where more \\\\ntransparency or explanation could be helpful, but we have \\\\nissued quite a few guidance statements over the past year or \\\\ntwo in this area, so for now, there is nothing imminently \\\\ncoming out, no.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. When you put together this guidance for banks \\\\nacross the State or the nation, do you look to State laws to \\\\nsee where they are at, States like Nebraska, to kind of give \\\\nyou an idea as to how you should put your program together?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. If we are examining a particular new activity, \\\\nwe are going to be doing that. In the context of State member \\\\nbank supervision, we are going to be partnering with States, \\\\nand we feed back what we learned from those exam activities \\\\ninto our guidance and policy process. We are always learning \\\\nfrom what is happening out in the States, and we take that into \\\\naccount when we make our own guidance.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. How many examiners are dedicated to the Novel \\\\nActivities Program? If the number of banks interested in these \\\\nactivities increases due to State pathways being created across \\\\nthe country, will the Federal Reserve have the resources and \\\\nthe bandwidth to be able to examine these institutions and work \\\\nwith them?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. I think we will. So far, we have allocated \\\\ndedicated examiners to our Novel Activities Supervision \\\\nProgram, and they have specialized training in these \\\\nactivities. So, we are using those examiners already on exams, \\\\npartnering with our local supervisory teams, and if that \\\\nactivity scaled up, we would plan to add more resources.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. I find that interesting because we could be \\\\nlooking at a new pool of applicants for examiners, given the \\\\ndigital innovation effort. Where do you see that coming from? \\\\nAnd when you look to hire new examiners, are you finding a \\\\nrenewed interest in this area, given that we are talking about \\\\ndigital currency, digital assets?\\\\n    Mr. Gibson. We have staffed our Novel Activities Program \\\\nmostly with internal examiners who have some expertise, and \\\\nthen get more training. We also hire from outside as well, so \\\\nit is a mix for us.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. That makes sense. It sounds safe and sound. I \\\\nappreciate your work. And I appreciate you having and \\\\nmaintaining such a good dialogue with the State that I \\\\nrepresent. That Federal-State partnership is important, and you \\\\nshould be credited for doing that.\\\\n    With that, thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The ranking member of the Full Committee, Ms. Waters of \\\\nCalifornia, is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you so very much. I guess I would like to \\\\ndirect this question to Ms. Szczepanik.\\\\n    We have recently seen another large crypto company, \\\\nBinance, held accountable for breaking the law. This time, \\\\nBinance knowingly engaged in money laundering, violated U.S. \\\\nsanctions, and did not register as a money transmitter. For \\\\nexample, it knowingly refused to report more than 100,000 \\\\nsuspicious transactions to law enforcement. Binance has been \\\\nordered to pay $4 billion, which includes the largest fine ever \\\\nfor Treasury to levy, to settle various criminal violations, \\\\nand its CEO has pled guilty to criminal charges. This comes on \\\\nthe heels of Sam Bankman-Fried&#x27;s conviction for stealing from \\\\nFTX customers. This also comes after the SEC filed a lawsuit \\\\nagainst Binance and its U.S. subsidiary for the sale of \\\\nunregistered securities, fraud, conflicts of interest, and lack \\\\nof disclosure.\\\\n    How does the SEC&#x27;s FinHub research and evaluate illicit \\\\nactivity in the crypto system? How do you assist the SEC in \\\\nensuring that other bad actors in the crypto space are held \\\\naccountable?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Thank you for the question. FinHub and its \\\\nstaff are made up not only of attorneys but also specialists in \\\\ncomputer science, in data analytics, and in financial analysis, \\\\nand we use those skills and special resources to scan the \\\\nmarket. So, we understand what is happening in the digital \\\\nasset market. We have the tools and technology that we need to \\\\ndo so. And we are looking proactively to analyze trends we see \\\\nthat may present harms to investors in the market, and we are \\\\npassing that information along to our colleagues who are \\\\nengaging in the activities of the Commission, for example in \\\\nthe Examinations, Enforcement, or Rulemaking Divisions, as they \\\\nconsider what needs to be done to protect investors in the \\\\nmarkets.\\\\n    We also participate as subject matter experts on a number \\\\nof domestic and international bodies that are addressing such \\\\nthings, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB), he \\\\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), \\\\nand the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. I am going to ask what \\\\ncould be a sensitive question, but I hope you will try and help \\\\nme with this. These crypto companies are coming to Congress and \\\\nto the Members of Congress. Some Members of Congress are truly \\\\ninterested in the role that crypto is going to play in the \\\\nworld, and particularly in the United States, but many of them \\\\nneed more information. They need more education. Have any of \\\\nyou thought about holding some special sessions with Members of \\\\nCongress to talk about the problems and the pitfalls that may \\\\noccur and give some information that would help them not to \\\\nbelieve that somehow they should be advancing, or even \\\\nadvocating, because maybe they just do not know enough? How \\\\ncould you help us with that?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. We are happy to provide that assistance \\\\nthrough our Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs \\\\n(OLIA). I would invite Members to reach out to OLIA if they \\\\nwant technical assistance on such matters.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Do you know whether or not crypto companies are \\\\nmaking huge contributions to Members of Congress?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. I cannot comment about that particular \\\\nissue.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. I said it was going to be sensitive. But what \\\\nother ways can you help us?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. That is a great question. We stand ready to \\\\nprovide any technical assistance through our Office of \\\\nLegislative Affairs, and the FinHub itself provides a \\\\nrepository of information concerning activities that the \\\\nCommission engages in, with respect to distributed ledger \\\\ntechnology, digital assets, and a number of other technologies \\\\non our FinHub website, so there are a number of resources \\\\nthere.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. I thank you for being here today, and I \\\\nappreciate your testimony, but I would like to try and organize \\\\nsmall groups of Members of Congress to be able to ask more \\\\nquestions and get more involved in what is really going on with \\\\nsome of these companies. So if any of you are willing to \\\\nparticipate at any time with smaller groups, where you can \\\\nanswer more specific questions, I would appreciate it very \\\\nmuch.\\\\n    And I yield back the balance of my time.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentlewoman yields back.\\\\n    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. \\\\nTimmons, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    The Office of Innovation was created by the CFPB in 2018 \\\\nduring the tenure of then-acting Director Mick Mulvaney. Its \\\\nprimary objective was to focus on creating policies to \\\\nfacilitate innovation, engage with entrepreneurs and \\\\nregulators, and review outdated or unnecessary regulations.\\\\n    However, in 2022, Director Chopra replaced this entity with \\\\nthe Office of Competition and Innovation, making a departure \\\\nfrom its predecessor&#x27;s focus. The new office is more inclined \\\\ntoward generating reports termed, ``issue spotlights,&#x27;&#x27; which \\\\nconcentrate on specific innovative products and services.\\\\n    The hallmark to the CFPB&#x27;s former Office of Innovation were \\\\nthe No-Action Letter and Compliance Assistance Sandbox \\\\nprograms, both of which limited regulatory uncertainty by \\\\nallowing companies to offer innovative financial products to \\\\nconsumers upon approval from the CFPB. In September of 2022, \\\\nboth policies were allowed to expire under the current \\\\nleadership.\\\\n    Ms. Epstein, do you believe that letting these policies \\\\nexpire would facilitate innovation within the financial \\\\nindustry, and what policies has the office introduced to foster \\\\nan opportune environment for innovative companies and products \\\\nin the wake of the No-Action Letter and Sandbox programs \\\\nexpiring?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. Thank you for the question. First, I did want \\\\nto point out that we still do have the only Federal-level \\\\nsandbox in existence, and as I mentioned in my testimony, we do \\\\nhave a current approval, a recent approval for the Independent \\\\nCommunity Bankers of America to test disclosures related to \\\\nconstruction loans, which is, I think, a very exciting place \\\\nwhere we can innovate with the community bankers to understand \\\\nwhere there might be improvements in the disclosures----\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. Are you saying that the Sandbox program \\\\ndeposit insurance did not expire, or you have replaced it with \\\\nsomething similar?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. There were multiple sandbox policies, so that \\\\nsandbox is still in effect, and we have a current approval. \\\\nUnfortunately, for the two policies that you did mention, they, \\\\nunfortunately, did not yield, in implementation, the expected \\\\nresults. So they were, sort of in summary, higher costs than we \\\\nhad expected, the benefits were a little more illusory, and \\\\nthen, the other piece of this, which was an inadvertent side \\\\neffect, was that we created advantages for the companies in the \\\\nsandbox in a competitive environment, which was not an expected \\\\nor desirable outcome.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. It seems we are moving in the wrong direction, \\\\nso thank you for that. The CFPB&#x27;s Office of Competition and \\\\nInnovation has a broader initiative than its predecessor, the \\\\nformer Office of Innovation. Can you describe how this expanded \\\\nmandate has impacted the Office&#x27;s interaction with market \\\\nparticipants? Just generally speaking, are we making it easier \\\\nfor people to compete or is it more regulation and less \\\\nstreamlining the challenges that they face?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. We continue to engage very fulsomely with the \\\\nentire fintech ecosystem, and try to understand, on a very \\\\nbroad level, what are the barriers to new entrants? We talk to \\\\nfintech companies. We talk to venture capitalists, seeing where \\\\nthe money is going, where they see, on sort of a broad level, \\\\nsome of these things are of issue. We talk to bankers. We talk \\\\nto large groups in the industry. The focus is more on a market \\\\nlevel as opposed to a particular fintech.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. I appreciate your comments, but I still have \\\\nconcerns about the Office&#x27;s new direction. I have introduced \\\\nnew legislation to revert this office back to its original \\\\nform, and I urge your office to once again adopt the No-Action \\\\nLetter and Sandbox policies that were previously in effect, \\\\nwhich laid the groundwork for innovative companies to thrive.\\\\n    One final question. The CFPB does not seem to be feeling \\\\nthe Christmas cheer this year. Two crucial comment periods come \\\\nto an end right after the holidays. Can the CFPB and Director \\\\nChopra commit to saving Christmas by providing comment period \\\\nextensions for both its 1033 and large participant proposals?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. I am not on the rulemaking team, but I am sure \\\\nthat the rulemaking team will take all extension requests \\\\nseriously.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. I think some more time would be appropriate. \\\\nWith that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.\\\\n    Chairman Hill. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    The gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Steil, is recognized for \\\\n5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thanks \\\\nfor holding today&#x27;s hearing.\\\\n    Financial innovations help millions of Americans navigate \\\\nwealth, make payments, and manage cash flow, and I think a lot \\\\nof technological developments we have had have been incredibly \\\\npositive. I think the real key here is that we are working with \\\\nthe regulatory bodies, as policymakers, to provide clarity, to \\\\nallow innovation to develop here in the United States, and that \\\\nwe have a pro-innovation perspective of this.\\\\n    I want to start with you, if I can, Ms. Epstein. The CFPB \\\\nhas proposed new rules for popular fintech products and \\\\nservices, and some of these regulations, in my opinion, will \\\\nhave a significant impact on the development of products and on \\\\ncompetition, broadly.\\\\n    I am interested in your role at the CFPB in how you \\\\ninteract with the CFPB rulemaking process. Could you walk us \\\\nthrough your involvement with that, and in the context of the \\\\nlarger picture of navigating the rulemaking process at CFPB and \\\\nyour role of assisting in innovation?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. Sure. My office is part of the Research, \\\\nMonitoring, &amp; Regulations Division at the CFPB. We fall under \\\\nthe monitoring category, so along with the statutory offices in \\\\nmarkets, which look at specific market segments as well as the \\\\npopulations teams, which look at the specific populations and \\\\nthe impact on, particularly things like military \\\\nservicemembers, older Americans, and so forth, we are \\\\nspecifically looking at some of the more longer-term and \\\\ntechnological aspects----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Let me dive in if I can, because I like where \\\\nyou are going, but we are limited in time. But as it relates to \\\\nthe CFPB rulemakings, do you opine on the impact those would \\\\nhave on future technological developments?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. Very similar to my colleague, it depends on \\\\nthe regulation itself, but we do offer technical assistance \\\\nrelated to various rulemakings, particularly in terms of \\\\nimplementing----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Maybe, I can use an example then. We had CFPB \\\\nDirector Chopra here a couple of days ago, and he was talking \\\\nabout the CFPB examining earned wage access under a new light. \\\\nIt is a highly-developing area where people have access to \\\\ntheir wages that they have already earned. Do you have \\\\nconversations with your colleagues? What does that look like as \\\\nit relates to an area that is innovating quickly?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. Yes. For example, on earned wage access, we do \\\\nprovide information about where the market is developing, the \\\\ndifferent business models----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. But do you provide comments as it relates to \\\\nwhether or not a rule would actually hinder innovation or \\\\ndevelopment?\\\\n    Ms. Epstein. We would have input into a rule.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. You would. Okay. That is helpful. Thank you very \\\\nmuch.\\\\n    I am going to shift gears, if I can, just because we are \\\\nlimited in time, and jump over to our friends at the SEC. Ms. \\\\nSzczepanik, in your opening statement, you were talking about \\\\nhow FinHub actively monitors international fintech \\\\ndevelopments, and engages in dialogue with foreign \\\\ncounterparts. Can you note any of the specific foreign \\\\ndevelopments that you are seeing from your foreign counterparts \\\\nthat we should be looking at developing in the United States?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. Sure. At FinHub, we are actively monitoring \\\\ndevelopments as they occur both domestically and \\\\ninternationally. We get involved, as subject matter experts, in \\\\nthe various work that is being done by international bodies \\\\nthat the SEC is involved with, for example, the Financial \\\\nStability Board, IOSCO, and the FATF. And what I am seeing is a \\\\nbroad consensus internationally about the risks that certain \\\\ntechnologies are posing, and I do see a broad consensus around \\\\nresponses to the risks.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Great. So, you see a broad consensus in \\\\nresponses. Do you see that in a regulatory framework being set \\\\nforward or in favor of an enforcement-first approach?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. What I see is that there are high-level \\\\nrecommendations being put forth by these authorities that \\\\nreally talk about same activities, same risks, same regulation, \\\\nand that is a guiding principle, as well as technology \\\\nneutrality.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. But in the enforcement-first approach I think \\\\nthe SEC has taken, do you see your counterparts engaging in a \\\\nsimilar fashion?\\\\n    Ms. Szczepanik. What I see is that there is a broad \\\\nconsensus internationally about the risks posed by new \\\\ntechnology.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. But not a broad consensus about how those risks \\\\nshould be managed, meaning whether or not a regulatory \\\\nframework being set forward, as we have here in Congress \\\\nlegislation that we have moved on, and hopefully the Senate \\\\nwill act on, I think that is a better approach than the \\\\nenforcement-first approach we have seen at the SEC.\\\\n    I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman Hill.

The Financial Services Committee will \\\\ncome to order.\\\\n    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a \\\\nrecess of the committee at any time.\\\\n    Today&#x27;s hearing is entitled, ``The Semi-Annual Report of \\\\nthe Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I now recognize myself for 4 minutes for the purposes of an \\\\nopening statement.\\\\n    Good morning. The public&#x27;s trust in our financial \\\\nregulators is shaken. Earlier this year, a Consumer Financial \\\\nProtection Bureau (CFPB) employee made an unauthorized transfer \\\\nof records containing personally identifiable information (PII) \\\\nand confidential supervisory information. Director Chopra, your \\\\nagency subsequently tried to downplay this major data breach.\\\\n    We recently found out that the Office of the Comptroller of \\\\nthe Currency (OCC) hired a fraud, who repeatedly lied about his \\\\nworkplace experience, to lead its Office of Financial \\\\nTechnology. The OCC also tried to sweep this incident under the \\\\nrug.\\\\n    Finally, we are all aware of the allegations of widespread \\\\nand entrenched workplace misconduct at the Federal Deposit \\\\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC). These allegations directly \\\\nimplicate Chair Gruenberg and span his almost 20-year tenure as \\\\nleader of the agency. Director Chopra, as CFPB Director, you \\\\nhave a seat on the FDIC Board, where you have made your \\\\npresence known, from the ouster of former FDIC Chair \\\\nMcWilliams, to the March bank failures and the subsequent weeks \\\\nof inaction thereafter. In other words, what the heck is going \\\\non at the FDIC?\\\\n    Director Chopra, this committee is interested in hearing \\\\nwhat you knew about the allegations, when you knew it, and any \\\\nactions you have taken to remedy this unacceptable situation. \\\\nThis string of scandals has left many, including myself, \\\\nquestioning whether these agencies are up to the task of \\\\nprotecting consumers and ensuring the safety and soundness of \\\\nour financial system.\\\\n    When you are not dealing with internal mismanagement, the \\\\nBiden Administration supposedly has independent financial \\\\nregulators that are busy serving as political actors for the \\\\nAdministration. Director Chopra, your leadership is a glaring \\\\nexample of this alarming trend of becoming a hyper-partisan \\\\nagency doing the bidding of the White House rather than \\\\nprotecting American consumers. That is much more about \\\\nelection-year politics than about what is right for consumers.\\\\n    The ongoing barrage of press releases from the CFPB is \\\\nmisleading at best. They too often paint with a broad brush to \\\\nvilify entire sectors of the financial services industry and \\\\neven the U.S. financial system as a whole rather than targeting \\\\nindependent bad actors. To make matters worse, when the Biden \\\\nAdministration doesn&#x27;t have the authority or the votes in \\\\nCongress to make a change, the CFPB, under your leadership, \\\\nsimply forges ahead and works unchecked. One need only look at \\\\nyour Small Business Data Collection rulemaking, Section 1071 of \\\\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, which goes well beyond the CFPB&#x27;s statutory \\\\nauthority to require the collection and reporting of onerous \\\\namounts of information in an attempt to facilitate the naming \\\\nand shaming of lenders whose business activities are \\\\nunfavorable to progressive activists. That is why House \\\\nRepublicans will pass a resolution this week to protect small \\\\nbusinesses&#x27; access to affordable credit by rescinding this \\\\nburdensome and overly-complex rule.\\\\n    But I would like to close on an area where I believe we \\\\nhave found some agreement, which is a good thing, and that is \\\\non your work on the Section 1033 data privacy proposal. We have \\\\ntalked about this in private. To be clear, I think what you \\\\nhave proposed is far from perfect, but I believe there is \\\\ncommon ground between your proposal and the Data Privacy Act \\\\nthat this committee passed earlier this year. We agree on the \\\\ncore of the issue, that Americans should have greater control \\\\nover their sensitive financial data. Consumers should know \\\\nwhere their data is going and how it is used, and should be \\\\nable to terminate the collection of their data by certain \\\\nfirms. To ensure our data privacy policy is not subject to the \\\\nwhims of any Administration, I believe it is critical that we \\\\nmake law here, not just regulation, although your regulation is \\\\na good step.\\\\n    I hope we can work constructively on this issue moving \\\\nforward so that Americans&#x27; financial data privacy is protected \\\\nfor the long term.\\\\n    With that, I yield back, and I recognize the ranking member \\\\nof the committee, Ms. Waters, for 4 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good \\\\nmorning. I would like to welcome Director Rohit Chopra back to \\\\nour committee and applaud the excellent work the CFPB has done \\\\nunder your leadership to protect our nation&#x27;s consumers. I am \\\\nalso pleased that this coming Saturday, Director Chopra will \\\\njoin me in my district in Los Angeles for a town hall meeting \\\\nwith my constituents to discuss consumer protections and access \\\\nto banking products and services. We will also hear from senior \\\\nexecutives from Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, City National Bank, and \\\\nlocal stakeholders.\\\\n    While the Senate is moving forward with a hearing featuring \\\\nBig Bank CEOs next week, I am very disappointed that this \\\\ncommittee is breaking with the tradition I established as \\\\nchairwoman to hold the same hearing. Our Members deserve the \\\\nsame opportunity to conduct oversight of our nation&#x27;s big \\\\nbanks. I hope the chairman will reconsider his decision and \\\\nconvene the CEOs for a hearing as soon as possible.\\\\n    Now, as the Solicitor General argued before the Supreme \\\\nCourt in October, the CFPB&#x27;s funding structure is \\\\nconstitutional, and gutting the only agency dedicated to \\\\nprotecting our nation&#x27;s consumers in the financial marketplace \\\\nwill harm our economy and communities. The lawsuit before the \\\\nSupreme Court is a part of a broader extremist effort by House \\\\nRepublicans to undermine and defund critical government \\\\nagencies and programs, even Social Security and Medicare. To be \\\\nclear, every single court that has reviewed CFPB&#x27;s funding has \\\\nreaffirmed its validity, other than the extremist Fifth \\\\nCircuit. Committee Democrats urge our nation&#x27;s justices to \\\\nstand with the 82 percent of Americans, including 77 percent of \\\\nRepublicans, who want the agency to continue doing its job.\\\\n    It is no mystery why the CFPB has such broad bipartisan \\\\nsupport. It has cracked down on financial institutions that \\\\nrepeatedly engage in abusive practices, held lenders \\\\naccountable for discriminating against borrowers, taken action \\\\nto remove medical debt from credit reports, eliminated junk \\\\nfees, increased access to capital for small businesses, \\\\nparticularly businesses of color, and more.\\\\n    Unfortunately, this week, House Republicans have launched \\\\nan effort to harm small businesses and help the Big Banks \\\\ncontinue to price gouge them by overturning the CFPB&#x27;s Small \\\\nBusiness Lending Rule, which implements Section 1071 of the \\\\nDodd-Frank Act, that I worked on with House Small Business \\\\nCommittee Ranking Member, Nydia Velazquez. This section \\\\nrequires lenders to collect and report data on small business \\\\nlending similar to what they already do for mortgage lending. \\\\nThis would help reduce borrowing costs for small businesses by \\\\ncreating a more transparent, competitive marketplace, and \\\\ncombat discriminatory lending practices. I am disappointed that \\\\nRepublicans are moving forward with this anti-small business \\\\neffort, and I would remind my colleagues that market \\\\ntransparency is a fundamental pillar of free market capitalism, \\\\nand that is exactly what this rule is focused on.\\\\n    I look forward to hearing from Director Chopra about the \\\\nimportance of this rule and the other good work of the CFPB. I \\\\nyield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman \\\\nfrom Kentucky, Mr. Barr, who is also the Chair of our \\\\nSubcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The CFPB is the most-unaccountable agency in the \\\\nentire Federal bureaucracy, and it is not just about Director \\\\nChopra; it is the structure itself. But, Director Chopra, under \\\\nyour leadership, the agency has acted unilaterally and \\\\narbitrarily outside its statutory mandate, and we have seen \\\\ntime and time again, the Bureau, under you and your \\\\npredecessors, pursue a lawless regulations-without-rules \\\\napproach, and attempt to change the law without congressional \\\\nauthorization and without complying with the Administrative \\\\nProcedure Act. This has not only led to a lack of \\\\naccountability by the agency and a lack of accountability to \\\\nthe American people, but it has also harmed the very consumers \\\\nthat, sir, your agency is supposed to protect. Due to the \\\\nCFPB&#x27;s novel funding mechanism, Congress has no visibility into \\\\nthe agency, and Congress needs to regain its power of the \\\\npurse, subject the Bureau to the congressional appropriations \\\\nprocess, and rein in this regulator.\\\\n    And you may have noticed that Congress rejected an \\\\namendment to defund the agency. We just need to fund the agency \\\\nthe right way, the constitutional way, and that is through the \\\\npower of the purse so that the agency becomes a professional \\\\nnonpartisan regulator, not a partisan regulator that acts \\\\noutside of the law. And we will bring light to this today. I \\\\nyield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \\\\nrecognizes the ranking member of our Subcommittee on Financial \\\\nInstitutions and Monetary Policy, Mr. Foster, for 1 minute.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Director Chopra. \\\\nSince we passed the Dodd-Frank Act that created the CFPB back \\\\nin 2010, the CFPB has effectively fulfilled its mission to \\\\nprotect consumers from unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices \\\\nin financial markets, despite coming under continual attack. \\\\nAnd despite those attacks, the CFPB has continued its work, \\\\nsecuring over $20 billion in relief for harmed consumers, over \\\\n$4 billion in penalties for violations of the law, and millions \\\\nof responses to consumer complaints, all while adapting its \\\\nsupervisory activities to a rapidly-changing financial sector, \\\\nand the public understands that.\\\\n    As the ranking member pointed out, over 82 percent of \\\\nAmericans and 77 percent of Republicans support the mission of \\\\nthe CFPB. And as our financial system becomes more digitalized \\\\nand complex, so do the scams and abuses and junk fees that \\\\nthreaten the life savings of the American people. So, I \\\\nencourage you to stay vigilant to our new challenges, and thank \\\\nyou for joining us today. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back.\\\\n    Today, we welcome the testimony of the Honorable Rohit \\\\nChopra, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Board--\\\\nBureau, sorry. We wish it was a board. Director Chopra, thank \\\\nyou for being here. You will have 5 minutes for an oral \\\\npresentation of your testimony, and without objection, your \\\\nwritten statement will be made a part of the record. You are \\\\nnow recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n\\\\n  STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE ROHIT CHOPRA, DIRECTOR, CONSUMER \\\\n               FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB)\\\\n\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Waters, \\\\nand members of the committee. I appreciate you holding this \\\\nhearing today. This is my 25th appearance before Congress in my \\\\ncareer, and I am grateful to many of you on this committee, on \\\\nboth sides of the aisle, for taking the time to meet with me \\\\nand provide advice to the CFPB on how to address the challenges \\\\nand opportunities we must all tackle: protecting sensitive \\\\npersonal financial data; reducing credit reporting errors; \\\\npreserving relationship banking; giving consumers more choice; \\\\nand so much more.\\\\n    Since I was here in June, I am pleased to share that the \\\\nCFPB has reached milestones on many of these issues, like \\\\naccelerating open banking in the U.S. and protecting financial \\\\nprivacy, while continuing to enforce the law fairly and deliver \\\\nresults for consumers and law-abiding businesses. Today, I want \\\\nto share some observations about household financial stability \\\\nand highlight some progress on our areas of work.\\\\n    As we enter the holiday season after a sustained period of \\\\nhigher interest rates, the CFPB is sharpening its focus on the \\\\nevolving patterns of household debt. And over the past few \\\\nyears, borrowing has accelerated across many key product \\\\nsegments. Americans now owe more than $17 trillion in household \\\\ndebt. Total outstanding credit card debt eclipsed $1 trillion \\\\nlast year for the first time since the CFPB began tracking it. \\\\nAuto loans have grown quickly, to an estimated $1.6 trillion.\\\\n    The CFPB&#x27;s analyses have found that rates and fees can \\\\ncontribute to persistent credit card debt for a growing number \\\\nof consumers. Americans paid $130 billion in interest and fees \\\\non credit cards last year, while annual percentage rates rose \\\\nfar above the cost of offering credit. The CFPB is taking a \\\\nnumber of steps to give consumers the ability to switch and \\\\ntake advantage of new offers.\\\\n    The return to repayment for Federal student loans continues \\\\nto be an area that we are monitoring, particularly the effect \\\\non other loan obligations like auto, credit card, and others. \\\\nOutstanding auto loan debt has grown, particularly given the \\\\nhigher cost of vehicles during the pandemic and higher interest \\\\nrates. These payments are consuming a greater share of income \\\\nfor many consumers, and we are actively monitoring credit \\\\nperformance.\\\\n    Residential mortgage activity has unsurprisingly declined. \\\\nThe decline has been precipitous, while interest rates, fees, \\\\ndiscount points, and other costs have increased. The result is \\\\nthat homebuyers have been paying much more. The CFPB is looking \\\\nfor ways to facilitate more refinancing activity, if and when \\\\nprevailing mortgage interest rates subside, to ensure that \\\\nborrowers who experience financial distress can navigate \\\\nalternatives to foreclosure, and we are looking to streamline \\\\nrules and procedures for servicers who are offering loan \\\\nmodifications.\\\\n    Since our Semiannual Report, the CFPB has proposed a rule, \\\\nas the chairman mentioned, under Section 1033, to accelerate \\\\nthe shift to what is known as, ``open banking,&#x27;&#x27; in the United \\\\nStates. We have also initiated an early part of the process to \\\\nimprove accuracy in credit reporting, especially for data \\\\nbrokers. We are also taking steps to address very widespread \\\\ninaccuracies on credit reports when it comes to medical bills.\\\\n    The CFPB&#x27;s supervision and enforcement program is \\\\nprotecting both consumers and honest firms who must compete \\\\nagainst those who egregiously violate the law. In the last 2 \\\\nyears, we have obtained orders totaling $8 billion in victim \\\\nredress and penalties. We are also tackling the junk fees that \\\\nhave been creeping across sectors of the economy and \\\\ninterfering with consumer choice.\\\\n    The CFPB has even shifted its supervisory resources toward \\\\nmany of the nonbanks due to the significant role that they play \\\\nin financial services today. We have also proposed a rule to \\\\nensure that many of these large nonbank companies adhere to the \\\\nsame rules that banks, credit unions, and other financial \\\\ninstitutions do.\\\\n    In August, our complaint database reached 4 million \\\\nsubmissions, and I am proud of the CFPB&#x27;s work in getting \\\\nconsumers the resolutions they deserve, often through referrals \\\\nfrom local organizations, your offices, and many others.\\\\n    Again, Chairman McHenry, I want to thank you for the \\\\nopportunity to appear before you today. We value all of your \\\\ninput, and I look forward to your questions.\\\\n    [The prepared statement of Director Chopra can be found on \\\\npage 80 of the appendix.]\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. Thank you. I now recognize myself for 5 \\\\nminutes for questions.\\\\n    Director Chopra, as I mentioned in my opening statement, I \\\\nthink we have some alignment here on updating data privacy \\\\nstandards and your implementation of Section 1033. You noted \\\\nthe importance of empowering consumers to exercise their full \\\\ndata rights without being trapped by powerful incumbents and \\\\nwithout losing control of their data. How does your proposal \\\\nensure that consumers can exercise full control over their \\\\nfinancial data?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Pursuant to the statute, the rule requires that \\\\nconsumers are able to permission their sensitive personal \\\\nfinancial data, and to prevent it being exploited by other \\\\nactors, we have put in some safeguards to ensure that it is \\\\nbeing permissioned only for the purpose of those financial \\\\nservices. I hope, Chairman McHenry, that you can legislate and \\\\nfigure out ways to address privacy more broadly. As you \\\\nmentioned, this rule is just one piece, but I think a \\\\nlegislative framework on privacy would be hugely valuable.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. Yes, and you allow for an opt-in \\\\nprovision. You ban the secondary use. There are some really \\\\nsmart things that you have approached this with, and you have \\\\ntaken input from a wide variety of people, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, and we looked at the discussions you all \\\\nhave had, especially where there is agreement. I really want \\\\nthis to be durable to last. I think it is important to restrict \\\\nsecondary use. You shouldn&#x27;t be able to bait someone to get \\\\ntheir sensitive data and then use it for a totally different \\\\npurpose.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. Is there a way for companies to use \\\\nanonymized data that they have captured from consumers in order \\\\nto build new products? Do you think that is a viable use?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. That is a place where we are specifically \\\\nlooking for input. One of the challenges that we are dealing \\\\nwith in today&#x27;s modern market is that re-identification is \\\\nbecoming easier to do, particularly with very advanced \\\\nartificial intelligence. So, I think that is a challenge we are \\\\ngoing to have to encounter and wrestle with through this \\\\nprocess.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. Okay. I look forward to continuing that \\\\nconversation. Now, as I have asked other financial regulators, \\\\nthis summer, you announced that you have had discussions with \\\\nthe European Commission, and you, ``started a dialogue,&#x27;&#x27; on \\\\nconsumer financial protection issues. Under what authority are \\\\nyou taking those actions for those negotiations?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Just to be clear, I think many of the developed \\\\neconomies are seeing the growing role of China, Chinese \\\\ntechnology firms, and financial data in the world. We are \\\\nseeing that we have many issues in common when it comes to \\\\nsurveillance, and when it comes to payments. So this, just to \\\\nbe clear, is a meeting. One of my predecessors, Acting Director \\\\nMulvaney, launched an initiative to join a global financial \\\\ninnovation network. Again, we see this as a way to understand \\\\nwhat other economies are doing, especially when it comes to----\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. Along those lines, they actually had \\\\npublic disclosures about those conversations--Director \\\\nKraninger, and Director Mulvaney. Do you intend to provide \\\\nmeeting minutes or any sort of public disclosure on what those \\\\nconversations----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We will try and make sure that we provide \\\\ntransparency as to what is being discussed. I think the purpose \\\\nof it, again, is, as we are seeing data being a growing factor, \\\\nespecially in financial services in the U.K. and Europe, all of \\\\nus are dealing with new ways of fraud, especially generative AI \\\\nfraud. So, we are really happy to do that.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. But from our perspective, what we want to \\\\nknow is what you are doing in your job and whether or not our \\\\nexisting rules require disclosures for these international \\\\nbodies? And I am asking you this specifically because your \\\\nBureau is doing this just like other financial regulators, and \\\\nproviding nothing in the way of disclosures around that other \\\\nthan to announce that you are having the conversations.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Okay.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. We would like the transparency.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Okay.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. Finally, digital assets. Under your \\\\nproposed rulemaking, you interpret the word, ``funds,&#x27;&#x27; to \\\\ninclude digital assets. Walk me through your thinking on that \\\\nproposed rulemaking, but let&#x27;s start with this: How many firms \\\\ndo you think you are touching with your notice of proposed \\\\nrulemaking?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We put an estimate. We believe it is the \\\\nlargest tranche, and many of them are going to be known to you. \\\\nThese are large firms that have nonbank payment apps, \\\\nessentially. I think with respect to the definition, we have \\\\nseen a number of court decisions that have sought to interpret \\\\nthe meaning of, ``funds.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Chairman, we have taken a very judicious approach to \\\\nthis to essentially focus on what is really being used as a \\\\nconsumer payment, not other digital asset uses, especially in \\\\nwholesale or trading or anything. We are really talking about a \\\\npayment, and I know you all are thinking through stablecoins \\\\nand payments. We really welcome the discussion on that as well.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. Thank you. I now recognize the ranking \\\\nmember for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Director \\\\nChopra, as I mentioned in my opening statement, more than a \\\\ndecade ago I worked closely with Congresswoman Velazquez to \\\\nensure that the Dodd-Frank Act included Section 1071 so that we \\\\ncould shine a bright light on the small business lending \\\\nmarket. Unfortunately, we have seen time and time again how \\\\nsome small businesses and their borrowers, especially those \\\\nthat are minority-owned, women-owned, or in rural areas, have \\\\ncharged more than they should be charging, if their application \\\\nwas not denied in the first place.\\\\n    As you know, I have long been disappointed that the Section \\\\n1071 rule took more than a decade to complete. Others were \\\\nfrustrated, too, including ReShonda Young, a Black woman who \\\\nfounded Popcorn Heaven, a small business selling gourmet \\\\npopcorn in Waterloo, Iowa. In 2014, she joined others to \\\\nsuccessfully sue the CFPB during the Trump Administration to \\\\ncompel the agency to complete the rulemaking. Ms. Young \\\\nexplained that she was the victim of a discriminatory lending \\\\npractice, saying, ``In several instances, there was just \\\\nblatant discrimination, and in other cases, I found out about \\\\nit later on, and it wasn&#x27;t just me.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    After the CFPB, then led by a Trump appointee, agreed to a \\\\ncourt-supervised settlement to complete the rulemaking, Ms. \\\\nYoung said, ``I am just really humbled to be part of the \\\\nprocess. Sometimes, we feel so small, and this is one of those \\\\nthings that shows that if we are willing to speak up, we \\\\nactually can make a difference.&#x27;&#x27; Ms. Young has since sold her \\\\nbusiness and is now working with other investors to open the \\\\nfirst Black-owned bank in Iowa, with the goal of being \\\\ncertified as a community development financial institution \\\\n(CDFI) and offering small business loans in a more-equitable \\\\nmanner than she was served.\\\\n    Director Chopra, do you believe Congress should ignore \\\\nentrepreneurs like Ms. Young and vote to rescind the CFPB&#x27;s \\\\nsmall business transparency rule? Specifically, who wins and \\\\nwho loses if the small business lending market continues to be \\\\nopaque?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think the pandemic showed how important small \\\\nbusinesses were in our economy and to so many entrepreneurs who \\\\nstruggled to get loans. And I think it is important to have a \\\\nsmall business loan market that is free of discriminatory \\\\npractices. We have done this with mortgages, and I think \\\\nCongress has told the CFPB, let&#x27;s do this with small business.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. And, Director Chopra, would you also briefly \\\\ndiscuss how the final rule minimizes the impact on community \\\\nbanks and credit unions?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We took a number of steps during the comment \\\\nperiod to reduce many of the questions that are being asked. We \\\\ntook steps to extend when they would have to comply with it. We \\\\nwere under a court order. We completed our requirement under \\\\nthat court order in time. But our goal is to really make sure \\\\nthere is a lot of support to make sure that the smallest \\\\ninstitutions can comply with this, and we also exempted a \\\\nsubstantial number of them who do not make many small business \\\\nloans.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Director Chopra, the CFPB issued guidance in \\\\nOctober to implement Section 1034(c) of Dodd-Frank, which \\\\ngenerally prohibits large banks and credit unions from charging \\\\nfees to provide basic account information to a consumer about \\\\ntheir own account when they request it. Would you discuss the \\\\ntype of fees banks are charging consumers to access their own \\\\ninformation and how you would expect this new guidance will \\\\nhelp ensure financial institutions follow the law and do not \\\\nimpose these types of junk fees on consumers?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If we want consumers to be able to manage their \\\\nfinancial lives, they need to be able to get the basic \\\\ninformation about their accounts, and Congress made clear in \\\\nthe Act that large institutions cannot throw up big barriers or \\\\ncreate obstacle courses for people to get that information. We \\\\nhave seen a number of fees that may be unreasonable. We have \\\\neven seen a fake paper statement fee where they neither printed \\\\nthe statement nor mailed it. So, we are trying to make sure the \\\\nlaw is being followed with fidelity.\\\\n    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Director Chopra. You are \\\\ndoing a fantastic job. I am so pleased that you are there \\\\nheading the CFPB, and I yield back the balance of my time.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Hill, \\\\nthe Vice Chair of the committee, is now recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director, it&#x27;s good to \\\\nhave you back. I wanted to pick up on a couple of topics that \\\\nwe started on in June and follow up on Section 1033, and \\\\ncontinue that conversation. And, of course, that rule is rooted \\\\nin the statute of Dodd Frank, and I grant that, but we have had \\\\n13 years to think about what the right direction is, and I want \\\\nto see that we get it right the first time. We have had a \\\\ncouple of good discussions about that, but I want to continue \\\\nthat.\\\\n    When you testified in June, I asked you about the scope \\\\nbeing considered for this proposal, which hasn&#x27;t changed from \\\\nthe Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \\\\n(SBREFA), Reg E, Reg Z, or the topic, and your focus on \\\\ntransaction data. But the proposal goes on, as it has now been \\\\nreleased, and says supplemental rulemaking might come out for \\\\nother covered persons and consumer financial products or \\\\nservices. We have had 13 years, and the agency has covered this \\\\nand talked about it, and Congress has for 13 years. Why leave \\\\nthat open-ended perpetual rulemaking potential? What other \\\\ncovered persons and products or services besides Electronic \\\\nBenefits Transfer (EBT) did the CFPB consider but ultimately \\\\ndecide against including in the proposal?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I like to follow in some ways the 80-20 \\\\nrule, which is, what can we get the most benefit for, and \\\\nreally start seeing it get moving, and what we found was that \\\\ntransaction data of your bank account or credit card was really \\\\ngoing to power much of open banking in the U.S. And even, let&#x27;s \\\\nsay, your auto loan or mortgage loan payment is often typically \\\\nstill reflected in your transaction account. So when it comes \\\\nto mortgage, auto, and other places, that is a lot of other \\\\nfinancial institutions, so we wanted to make sure we studied \\\\nthat a little bit more to see how much additional data it would \\\\nactually provide.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. But I appreciate what you are saying.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Yes. The second issue that I raised in June, and \\\\nyou did not have an answer to, and now we have a proposal, is \\\\ndata breach liability. Where have you come ashore on who bears \\\\nthe liability for a data breach?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Generally speaking, when a consumer permissions \\\\ntheir data, they are handing over their data to that new \\\\nfinancial institution. We got some feedback that they wanted \\\\nthe rule to have some specific regulatory text on liability \\\\ngenerally. I think one challenge is that we can&#x27;t necessarily \\\\nprovide liability protection for every single law that exists. \\\\nWe are trying to figure out under which of our statutes can we \\\\nmake sure it is absolutely clear that it is the receiving \\\\ninstitution that really is responsible for handling that data. \\\\nAnd in the data-handling section of the rule, we do specify the \\\\nrequirements that the receiving firm would have.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I don&#x27;t know if we got it perfectly right. We \\\\ndefinitely want to hear feedback on this.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. We will look at that, and we may follow up on \\\\nthat. Let me switch gears. In the last few days, you have \\\\nissued a new rule, a large participants proposal by the agency, \\\\nand it has new supervisory oversight over nonbanks offering \\\\ndigital payments and wallets. It is a pretty major step since \\\\nyou are really an enforcement agency, not a supervisory agency, \\\\nI would say, principally. The proposal threshold for this \\\\nsupervisory oversight is based on the annual volume of consumer \\\\npayment transactions, so I am not going to debate that, whether \\\\nit is $1 million or $5 million. I am more curious about some \\\\nclarity about who is covered. I assume that the six companies \\\\nnamed in October orders are included: Amazon, Apple, Google, \\\\nMeta, PayPal, and Square. Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Again, that is currently a proposal, and let me \\\\njust share, Congressman Hill, we devote way more resources to \\\\nsupervision, and the rule we have proposed----\\\\n    Mr. Hill. You can send me a written answer to that. You can \\\\ncomment on that, but let&#x27;s talk about this question.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. No, I am trying to get to----\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Yes, but I want to get to it.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The top firms, what we have proposed is a \\\\nthreshold for which, if they are above that, they would be \\\\nsubject to supervision.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Who is left, besides the ones that were named in \\\\nOctober? Are big retailers covered on that?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Again, it is not always a matter of public \\\\nrecord how many transactions or customers they have. What we \\\\nare trying to do is get comments on the threshold, and we would \\\\nthen be able to determine who is above that. But if I were to \\\\nspeculate, and I am just speculating, the most popular nonbank \\\\npayment apps would be covered.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Okay. I look forward to following up with you on \\\\nthis.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Of course.\\\\n    Mr. Hill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. The \\\\ngentlewoman from New York, Ms. Velazquez, is recognized for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member \\\\nWaters. Welcome to the committee, Director Chopra, it is really \\\\ngood to see you, and I just want to say that I really \\\\nappreciate the CFPB&#x27;s work protecting consumers, including \\\\nservicemembers, older adults, and my constituents. And I want \\\\nto join with Ranking Member Waters in our disappointment of the \\\\nRepublicans&#x27; attempt to overturn the Section 1071 rule. Let me \\\\nstate for the record that as the ranking member of the House \\\\nSmall Business Committee, I strongly support the Section 1071 \\\\nrule.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra, I was very pleased to see the joint statement \\\\non immigration status that the CFPB and the Department of \\\\nJustice issued. Is this based on new information?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No. This is longstanding law from the Justice \\\\nDepartment and the CFPB.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. To be clear, does the joint statement tell \\\\nbanks they have to make loans to immigrants?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No. At the CFPB, and the DOJ, we do not tell \\\\nanyone to make a loan to a particular person.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. And can banks still consider an applicant&#x27;s \\\\nimmigration status?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. The guidance makes it very clear that a \\\\ncreditor may consider immigration status when making a lending \\\\ndecision.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. So, why did the CFPB issue this joint \\\\nstatement now?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It was clear, based on feedback from lenders, \\\\nthat there were court decisions and adjudications that raised \\\\nsome questions about the use of immigration status. We affirmed \\\\nthat you can use immigration status, but at the same time, we \\\\nwanted to make sure that it was clear that national origin \\\\ndiscrimination is completely prohibited.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. I want to thank you for issuing guidance. As \\\\nthe ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, I \\\\nknow that smaller institutions often cannot afford an army of \\\\nlobbyists and big law firms, so more guidance is especially \\\\nhelpful for them. I also know that discrimination on the basis \\\\nof race, national origin, or immigration status, unfortunately, \\\\nis still very much present today, and I take it very seriously. \\\\nI know what it is like to be judged by your name and \\\\nstereotyped as a member of an ethnicity.\\\\n    I understand you recently took an enforcement action \\\\ninvolving a blatant, intentional, egregious discrimination case \\\\nagainst a population group that is prominently represented in \\\\nNew York City. As a proud member of the caucus that championed \\\\nthem, along with about 100 of my bipartisan colleagues, can you \\\\nplease tell me about Citi&#x27;s discrimination against Armenian \\\\nAmericans?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We recently finalized an enforcement action \\\\nthat addressed intentional discrimination against Armenian \\\\nAmericans in Citibank&#x27;s credit card business. They had a policy \\\\nof essentially disqualifying anyone whose name has a suffix of, \\\\n``Y-A-N,&#x27;&#x27; or, ``I-A-N.&#x27;&#x27; That is extremely common with \\\\nArmenian Americans, and in many cases, Citibank provided false \\\\nrecords about why those borrowers were denied and made up other \\\\nreasons for it. And again, I think our guidance tries to make \\\\nclear you can use immigration status, but you can&#x27;t engage in \\\\nnational origin discrimination.\\\\n    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, \\\\nis now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Director Chopra. As \\\\nyou know, the House will vote this week on a Congressional \\\\nReview Act resolution of disapproval to the CFPB&#x27;s rule on \\\\nsmall business lending, led by my colleague, Chairman Roger \\\\nWilliams. The Senate has already passed this resolution, which \\\\nrequired a bipartisan vote, and while Congress is working to \\\\nrescind the final rule, it seems this may be decided ultimately \\\\nby the courts.\\\\n    In the meantime, I would like to focus on one aspect of the \\\\nfinal rule on which I would appreciate clarification. The \\\\nPaperwork Reduction Act requires agencies to determine the \\\\ntotal paperwork burden by hours of major rulemakings. This \\\\nmeasures the time required to generate and provide the \\\\nrequested information of the rule. CFPB estimated the total \\\\nannual burden hours imposed by this final rule to be 8,302,000, \\\\nwhich is the equivalent of 947 years. Director Chopra, would \\\\nyou discuss how the CFPB balances the compliance burden with \\\\nthe value of the paperwork being produced, because 8 million \\\\nhours is a lot of time.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We try and analyze various ways to reduce the \\\\nburden, and in the rule, we actually provided different \\\\nflexibilities. They don&#x27;t have to use a particular form, but in \\\\nthis case, Congressman, we were under a court order to complete \\\\nthe rule. It was a statutory mandate, so we knew we had to do \\\\nit, and we tried to look at various ways that firms could be \\\\nable to use industry associations to help them collect it. So, \\\\nwe always are looking at analyzing what kind of burden there is \\\\nwhen thinking about how we ultimately implement it.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. But broadly speaking, Director, how can the CFPB \\\\nbest maximize the utility and the quality of information \\\\nreceived while minimizing, to the extent possible, the \\\\npaperwork burden imposed on the American public?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We put a lot of thought into this, and I had a \\\\ndiscussion with a few of you. One of the reasons why these \\\\nrules can often create a lot of burden is when they are \\\\nexcessively complex. And I think, overall, we need to continue \\\\nto shift to rules that are very bright line, that they are in \\\\nor out, so that we can reduce the amount of overall kind of \\\\nthinking about how to actually deal with it. In some cases, it \\\\nis hard. Congress may specify certain aspects that need to be \\\\ndone, but we are looking at simplification wherever we can.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. I am, by training, a director and an \\\\nagricultural economist, and our main focus is on making sure \\\\nthat we have enough food and fiber to meet our needs in this \\\\ncountry and in this world, and economics, by its nature, is, \\\\nhow do you allocate those finite resources and unlimited \\\\ndemands to maximize the return? Is there a volume of reporting \\\\nthat outweighs the cost, I guess is what I am asking? Just \\\\nasking for every conceivable bit of information doesn&#x27;t \\\\nnecessarily add to the quality of the result. Do you have \\\\neconomists, do you have people who work on those calculations \\\\nas opposed to just, how much information can we squeeze out of \\\\npeople, but the value of it, again, the volume when it \\\\noutweighs the cost?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We have an Office of Research where we \\\\nhave economists who help to look at all of this, and under the \\\\nregulatory flexibility analysis that we are required to do, we \\\\ntalk through that. I will share, though, in terms of putting \\\\nvalue on the benefits, it also can sometimes be hard to give a \\\\nbenefit and a number to not being illegally discriminated \\\\nagainst or put in a loan that was unlawful. We try our best, \\\\nand I won&#x27;t say that it is always the easiest thing, but we put \\\\na lot of rigor into what we are doing.\\\\n    Mr. Lucas. We would suggest, Director, that with the vote \\\\nin the United States Senate and the efforts of Chairman \\\\nWilliams here in the House, Congress is going to send a very \\\\nclear signal to you about how to address these issues, and I \\\\nhope that the agency will be responsive. But we shouldn&#x27;t make \\\\nthe best job guarantee in the history of the world being a \\\\ncompliance officer at some financial institution, and that \\\\nappears to be what we have done is provided job security for \\\\nthe folks who deal with these 8 million hours of paperwork, and \\\\nI am not sure that adds to the quality of life of my \\\\nconstituents. And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman \\\\nfrom California, Mr. Sherman, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Mr. Director, I want to join with the ranking \\\\nmember and others in commending you for an outstanding job. You \\\\nhave dealt with 4 million consumer complaints, and returned \\\\n$17.5 billion to consumers with just your rule on overdraft \\\\nprotection, saving consumers $5 billion. And that is just the \\\\ntip of the iceberg because when you take action, you not only \\\\nreturn money to wronged consumers, you deter bad practices \\\\nthrough the whole industry so the consumers don&#x27;t get ripped \\\\noff in the first place. I want to commend your efforts on junk \\\\nfees. Because of my focus on capital markets, I digress a \\\\nlittle bit and mention that, unfortunately, the SEC is thinking \\\\nof adding a junk fee to mutual fund investors or many of them, \\\\nbut that is not the focus of this hearing.\\\\n    I also want to say that I am relatively confident the \\\\nSupreme Court will uphold your structure. It is so necessary to \\\\nmake sure that you have the independence you need to do the \\\\ngood work that you have been doing. I am also pleased that you \\\\nissued proposed rules dealing with Property Assessed Clean \\\\nEnergy (PACE) loans. These loans seem to have perhaps a well-\\\\nintentioned purpose but are used by those who are predatory. My \\\\nhome State of California took action in 2017. Your rule builds \\\\non that work in California, providing not only the Truth in \\\\nLending Act protection, but especially those ability to repay \\\\ndeterminations. Can I count on you not to weaken the rule as we \\\\nget from proposed to final?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. It is currently under process, but let me \\\\njust say the ability to pay rules are very, very important to \\\\nmake sure that rulemaking meets its intended purposes. I \\\\ncompletely share your view that there are a lot of well-\\\\nintentioned elements of PACE lending, but it can also lead to a \\\\nlot of abuse.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. We have these debt settlement companies that \\\\nclaim that they will have you pay off your debt without having \\\\nto pay the amount you owe. Your website says that dealing with \\\\nthese companies can be risky. Some of these companies are \\\\ndiscouraging consumers from making payments, causing them to \\\\ndefault, and even encouraging them to take on additional debt. \\\\nWhat can you do about those who are advising people not to pay \\\\nwhat they owe and to even incur more debt they can&#x27;t afford to \\\\nrepay?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly, we have seen a number of issues \\\\nwhere consumers are seeking help, but, instead, they become \\\\nworse off. We recently finalized an order--we went to court to \\\\nget it--against one of the largest debt repair conglomerates \\\\nand obtained a judgment close to $3 billion. So, we continue to \\\\ntry and monitor what are the vectors in which people are being \\\\ndefrauded. We understand that there may be an uptick soon \\\\nbecause TikTok will be allowing more ads on this business, so \\\\nwe are very much monitoring the situation.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. Just another reason to be wary of TikTok. We \\\\nhave a real concern about Know Your Customer/Anti-Money \\\\nLaundering (KYC/AML), with 1.1 million reports of identity \\\\ntheft. There is a thing called the credit header data, which is \\\\njust the name and address and Social Security number, nothing \\\\nelse in the credit report. These are being used by financial \\\\ninstitutions in order to verify identity and to prevent \\\\nidentity theft and to comply with the Know Your Customer laws. \\\\nThere is some discussion in your agency to qualify just this \\\\nname, address, Social Security report as a consumer report. \\\\nWill this adversely affect the ability to prevent identity \\\\ntheft and compliance with Know Your Customer laws?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No, I appreciate the question, and we have not \\\\nproposed anything on this. We do not want to do anything that \\\\nwould jeopardize a financial institution&#x27;s ability to really \\\\ncrack down on identity theft. I think certainly, though, we \\\\nknow that this data is being used outside of financial \\\\ninstitutions, including to steal people&#x27;s identity. So, I think \\\\nthat is what we are looking at with respect to data brokers and \\\\nhow we might handle some of this, but, again, we have not \\\\nproposed anything on this front.\\\\n    Mr. Sherman. And finally, I hope you will make sure that \\\\nyou have protection for privacy as you move forward with these \\\\nSection 1071 rules. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. We will \\\\nnow go to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Sessions, for 5 \\\\nminutes.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Director \\\\nChopra, it&#x27;s good to see you. I must applaud you for your \\\\nglibness and your ability to effectively take questions from \\\\nboth sides of this committee and to respectfully offer back \\\\nyour viewpoint. I want to offer that to you, because I \\\\nappreciate your forthrightness.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I appreciate that.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Mr. Director, as you know, The Wall Street \\\\nJournal yesterday or the day before put an article out, ``The \\\\nCFPB Targets an Antiterror Tool,&#x27;&#x27; and, essentially, it is \\\\ntalking about selling credit header data to law enforcement. \\\\nBut also, they had written another article, and been more \\\\nspecific also about credit information that would be available \\\\nabout what might be criminal history, that people who are going \\\\nto lend money would have that opportunity to buy this data and \\\\ninformation as they chose at the time they are going to give \\\\nsomeone money, offer a loan. If you could please address both \\\\nof those circumstances, because it seems like you are on the \\\\nwrong side, at least in my opinion, of this issue.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. And to be clear, we have not proposed \\\\nanything. We are a law enforcement agency as well. We need to \\\\nbe able to identify bad actors. It has been nearly 4 years \\\\nsince then-Attorney General Barr indicted three members of the \\\\nChinese Communist Party&#x27;s (CCP&#x27;s) People&#x27;s Liberation Army \\\\n(PLA) with respect to Equifax. There is no question that \\\\nsensitive data about each of us cannot just be used to steal \\\\nidentities, but also for use by state and nonstate actors. I \\\\nthink we want to make sure that data is being used in ways that \\\\nis appropriate here in the United States. There is not an \\\\neffort to stop law enforcement or, as Congressman Sherman \\\\nmentioned, to help financial institutions detect money \\\\nlaunderers, but we also need to think----\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. How about other criminal history?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. On criminal history, I actually haven&#x27;t heard a \\\\nreference to anything we have been doing on criminal history. \\\\nGenerally speaking, for any sort of background report, \\\\nincluding a credit report, a tenant screening report, or an \\\\nemployment background check, the only requirement that \\\\ncurrently exists right now is that that data be accurate. If it \\\\nis a consumer reporting agency, there are rights to dispute. I \\\\nam happy to talk about it with you separately, but I am not \\\\nfamiliar with the restrictions.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Good. I will just do it right here. I am \\\\ngoing to ask unanimous consent to put into the record, Mr. \\\\nChairman, two articles: number one, ``The CFPB Targets an \\\\nAntiterror Tool,&#x27;&#x27; that appeared in The Wall Street Journal; \\\\nand number two, ``Remarks of CFPB Director Rohit Chopra at \\\\nWhite House Roundtable on Protecting Americans from Harmful \\\\nData Broker Practices&#x27;&#x27; from the CFPB website on August 15, \\\\n2023.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. Without objection, it is so ordered.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Director, I think that the reason why we get specific about \\\\nthese items on both sides of the aisle is that we find that \\\\nthere is happy-talk conversation between us, and then something \\\\ndifferent appears, as in what might be the 1071 debacle that \\\\nour colleague, my baseball coach, Roger Williams, Chair of the \\\\nHouse Small Business Committee, headed up yesterday at the \\\\nRules Committee. Great discussion, great dialogue, but we are \\\\ngoing to vote on it today. It received five Democratic votes in \\\\nthe United States Senate, I think, earlier in October.\\\\n    My point is that I would like to have, and I think you have \\\\noffered this to me, a conversation about these pending matters. \\\\nAnd while I do say that you offered that to me--sometimes in \\\\nour haste, we do it here--but I would like to have a \\\\nconversation about this because I think it would be in \\\\neveryone&#x27;s best interest, including the CFPB, that we see these \\\\nrollouts of ideas closer to the same way.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I want to do that, and I think the chairman \\\\nalso mentioned this also relates to privacy, the Fourth \\\\nAmendment. There are all sorts of issues. It&#x27;s always the best \\\\nthing when you can legislate on it----\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We are very happy to do that because the truth \\\\nis, once you legislate on it, it is----\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. The Fourth Amendment is about privacy, but it \\\\nis also about somebody not taking your data and information----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. That is correct.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. ----without a court order.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    Mr. Sessions. Thank you very much, Mr. Director. Thank you, \\\\nMr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, is \\\\nnow recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Chopra, I want \\\\nto begin by expressing my strong support to you and to your \\\\nstaff at the CFPB for ensuring that Americans&#x27; data is accurate \\\\nand secure. You are doing a great job.\\\\n    In March of this year, the CFPB issued a request for \\\\ninformation (RFI) on data broker practices, and you asked for \\\\ninformation about how this market works and what consumers&#x27; \\\\nexperiences are with the data brokers. And I understand you \\\\nreceived over 7,000 comments, and, overwhelmingly, comments \\\\nfrom consumers expressed frustration with the lack of control \\\\nover who has access to their data, who uses their data, and who \\\\nis sharing their data, and comments over the difficulty \\\\nconsumers have with opting out of having their data shared. \\\\nEven when they can identify data brokers, concerns were also \\\\nraised that data broker practices result in large amounts of \\\\nunwanted spam, marketing calls, emails, and, worst of all, \\\\nleave people vulnerable to identity theft and data breaches.\\\\n    I know there has been some confusion about the Bureau&#x27;s \\\\nwork in relationship to data brokers from some of my Republican \\\\nfriends. Can you explain how the comments received in the \\\\nrequests for information is going forward?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I appreciate that, and let me just say that I \\\\nthink it is becoming increasingly scary about the types of \\\\ndossiers about us online--geolocation, religious attendance--\\\\nvery sensitive data being compiled and often sold. The Fair \\\\nCredit Reporting Act (FCRA) is our core statute for ensuring \\\\nthat those dossiers have some degree of transparency, that they \\\\nare accurate, and that people can dispute it.\\\\n    So, we are trying to figure out what is the right way to \\\\nmake sure in the modern data broker industry that there is some \\\\nevenhanded consumer protection. We have a lot of firms who \\\\nfollow that clearly. And we want to make sure that we are \\\\nproviding the appropriate clarity so we don&#x27;t have an out-of-\\\\ncontrol system. And I will share that a lot of these are being \\\\nused and purchased by people overseas, and it is a huge vector \\\\nfor stealing identities and scamming people.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. Let me ask you this question that is important \\\\nto all of us, and that is, we are all concerned about the \\\\nextent to which data brokers are collecting and selling \\\\nchildren&#x27;s data--which is a big thing going on--and allowing \\\\nthe children&#x27;s data to be used for marketing, targeting, and \\\\nworse. One recent study found that 67 percent of phone \\\\napplications used by very young children collected highly-\\\\nsensitive data and then transmitted this data to third parties. \\\\nTell us about this?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Many years ago, Congress passed the Children&#x27;s \\\\nOnline Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and with the advent of \\\\nmore data brokers, I think kids and seniors are going to be \\\\nvery important for us to think about as to how we safeguard \\\\ntheir sensitive data. There is work on this committee that I \\\\nthink you can all do. We are happy to really work with you to \\\\nfigure out what are all the solutions we can get, because \\\\ncollecting all of this kids&#x27; data, too, when they are an adult \\\\ncan just be another way to defraud people.\\\\n    Mr. Scott. We really have to look out for our young people, \\\\nour future generations, and make sure they are educated \\\\nproperly and that their interests are protected when it comes \\\\nto this new technology. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Posey, is \\\\nnow recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Many of the \\\\nomnipresent defenders of the nonexistent problems of the people \\\\ntalk about all the junk fees you have eliminated. So, would you \\\\ntell us what a junk fee is?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Junk fees are ones that are typically not \\\\nsubject to the competitive process. You have to click through \\\\nthe screen. You find them at the end. Sometimes, they are for a \\\\nservice that doesn&#x27;t even really exist. Sometimes, they are \\\\njust completely hidden and random, so there are lots of \\\\ndifferent ones. We have really tried to focus----\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Okay. Can you give me a couple of examples of \\\\nthose?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. For example, I mentioned to one of your \\\\ncolleagues that we identified in one of our examinations and \\\\nsimilar other places a paper statement fee that was charged on \\\\na recurring basis where the financial institution did not even \\\\nprint out a piece of paper, nor did they mail it.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Yes. That just sounds like a fraud. Is there a \\\\nstatutory definition? Have you put in the statute somewhere a \\\\ndefinition of a, ``junk fee,&#x27;&#x27; so we know exactly what we are \\\\ntalking about?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No, but we have tried to really articulate \\\\nthrough the various laws that we enforce where certain fees may \\\\nnot be permitted under existing law.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Don&#x27;t you think you should articulate those more \\\\nclearly or put them in writing so everyone knows what it really \\\\nis?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We are trying to. We are trying to take the \\\\nfeedback of where we should be issuing guidance on this. \\\\nOverall, I would say the market has really moved in many ways \\\\nand is being more clear about how fees are being assessed. That \\\\nis very, very good progress. But inasmuch that there are \\\\nparticular places you think we need to issue more guidance, we \\\\nare very, very open to it. We have published some information \\\\nwhere we give examples of what we have uncovered in enforcement \\\\nand exams, that in some ways have been pretty egregious \\\\nviolations.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. How do you assess the impact of your regulations \\\\non the cost of access to credit?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Big picture or as it relates to fees or----\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Big picture.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Big picture, I think, as I mentioned to your \\\\ncolleague, we try and really look and have fidelity to the \\\\ncompetitive market. We really want people to be able to compete \\\\nfor business and that it is clear the product they are getting \\\\nand the price they are getting.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Does that involve assessing the cumulative \\\\nimpact on the entire system of regulations?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. One of the places of feedback that, in all \\\\nmy meetings with industry and that you all have given, is we \\\\nall need to be thinking about all of the issues together. The \\\\nCFPB is not the only one----\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Would you describe your process for considering \\\\nthe cumulative impact of your regulations on the access to \\\\ncredit?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We have a requirement under the statute, I \\\\nbelieve it is the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). We have to \\\\nconduct an analysis about the impact of regulations and, of \\\\ncourse, we have to look at that in the context of other ones \\\\nthat are current or are being implemented. In our proposed \\\\nrules, we tend to outline that, and we include some data and \\\\nestimates. We get comments on it and try and be able to refine \\\\nbased on that input.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. How do you use your cost-benefit analysis? Do \\\\nyou do cost-benefit analysis if any of your regulations rise to \\\\nthat level?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Sorry. I just couldn&#x27;t hear a little bit.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. I said, have you done any cost-benefit analyses? \\\\nHave any of your regulations risen to that level?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Risen to that level?\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Yes, the standard. The government says you can \\\\nwrite a ridiculous rule, but if it doesn&#x27;t harm people to the \\\\ntune of over $100 million----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Right. The path we follow is really what is \\\\nspelled out in the statute. As I mentioned, in the proposed \\\\nrule, we have to spell out the cost. We articulate what the \\\\nbenefits are, and we follow exactly what is in the statute. We \\\\neven collect comments on the analysis as well.\\\\n    Mr. Posey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman \\\\nfrom Illinois, Mr. Foster, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Director Chopra. I \\\\nwas very encouraged to hear my Republican colleagues&#x27; support \\\\nfor your mission, and that they agree with roughly 80 percent \\\\nof Americans that you are doing something useful here, and I \\\\nfind that especially reassuring in light of the fact that \\\\nearlier this month, Republicans voted 140-78 to completely \\\\ndefund the CFPB. I will just leave that there.\\\\n    However, we have also heard a lot about the number of hours \\\\nthat have to be spent on compliance as a real cost here. Do you \\\\nalso track the number of hours that consumers lose, for \\\\nexample, through ID fraud when they have to spend all afternoon \\\\non hold replacing all of their credit cards?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It can be very hard, but we know there have \\\\nbeen some reports that show the enormous amount of cost to \\\\nconsumers, not even counting their time, of dealing with \\\\nidentity theft, credit reporting errors, going back and forth \\\\nabout inaccuracies. It is an enormous amount of time.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. That is right, but quantifying it in the number \\\\nof hours, if you could make an attempt to quantify the number \\\\nof consumer hours that are sort of on the other side of the \\\\nscale here, that would be----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We do know that there are millions of disputes \\\\nfiled on credit reporting-related issues which does involve a \\\\nmulti-step process.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Right, so you multiply that by the average time \\\\nthe consumer wastes with a mistake on their credit file. We \\\\nhave to balance everything, and that is an important weight to \\\\nput on the other side. I have been really encouraged to see \\\\nthat you have raised the alarm over artificial intelligence \\\\n(AI) and where that is taking the whole thing. The leading edge \\\\nof this is probably AI-enabled deepfake impersonations, which \\\\nis going to have to result in our really raising the bar on \\\\nsecure digital identity and proving you are who you say you \\\\nare. Where do you see that going and the role of----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Let me just say that I strongly support any \\\\nefforts you all can make when it comes to getting better \\\\ndigital identity verification. The amount that we would save \\\\nbusinesses and consumers in fraud would be enormous. I don&#x27;t \\\\nknow how to do it necessarily, but using just publicly-\\\\navailable information about someone to authenticate, and when \\\\nwe add in generative AI, we do have firms that allow you to \\\\nauthenticate into their system with your voice. You as public \\\\nofficials, it is becoming very easy to clone all of your voices \\\\nbecause once it is in the public domain, there is a data set to \\\\nbe able to duplicate it. So, we have to make sure that we are \\\\nnot opening up even more fraud with some of this.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Yes. In your conversations with other countries \\\\nthat have been sort of looked at skeptically at this hearing, \\\\nhave you taken a look at how they are dealing with it, because \\\\nsome countries are doing a much better job, frankly, of a \\\\nsecure, safe, privacy-preserving digital identity? And they did \\\\nnot, for example, have hundreds of billions of dollars for \\\\nCOVID benefit identity fraud, and it is a real decrease in the \\\\namount of what the fraudsters can get away with to have a \\\\nsecured digital ID.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. A stronger digital authentication layer would \\\\nhave so many benefits, including other obligations that banks \\\\nhave. It could reduce their cost on anti-money laundering \\\\ndetection and really, overall, in our commercial economy.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Yes. McKinsey has estimated, I think, between 2 \\\\nand 3 percent GDP loss from not having a high-quality digital \\\\nidentity. Other countries are doing a better job, so I think \\\\nthat is an area where you should pay attention to other \\\\ncountries.\\\\n    Okay. Now, there are other aspects of artificial \\\\nintelligence that are going to be huge. During the last years \\\\nwhen I was chairing the AI Task Force that we had set up on \\\\nthis committee, we were wrestling with sort of bias-type \\\\nproblems that happen when you just take a credit history and \\\\nyou put it into a neural net that is incomprehensible, and out \\\\ncomes an answer. And we are now going to be facing really even \\\\nmore complex ones where the next generation of AIs learn from \\\\ntheir experience.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. So, it is like a child. You raise your child \\\\nperfectly, you make sure it is behaving properly, then you send \\\\nit off into the world with no guarantee that it won&#x27;t come in \\\\ncontact with things that make it become evil. How do you view \\\\nthe increased surveillance you are going to need on AI after it \\\\nhas been released in the wild?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I think there are a lot of questions you \\\\nall have to answer. We have taken the view that it is important \\\\nthat existing law not be sidestepped on this, because at the \\\\nend of the day, if there is generative AI making \\\\nrepresentations, communicating with consumers, that has to be \\\\ntruthful. When it comes to all sorts of uses, the existing law \\\\nstill applies, but there is a lot we have to do on this.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. Yes. When you figure it out, please let me \\\\nknow.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Foster. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. \\\\nLuetkemeyer, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My good friend, \\\\nMr. Williams, often starts some of the discussions by asking \\\\nwhether you are a capitalist or a socialist.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. As I mentioned, I think I have appeared before \\\\nCongress 25 times and have mentioned every time that I am very \\\\nmuch a capitalist.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. I appreciate that, but I was curious--I \\\\nwould assume that you believe the banking industry should be a \\\\nfor-profit industry?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, and I think the banking industry is just \\\\nas essential as our communications infrastructure, and as our \\\\nelectric grid.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Mr. Chopra, your actions are completely \\\\ndifferent, though, than what you say. During your tenure at the \\\\nBureau, the Administration has spoken of or taken actions on \\\\nbanks&#x27; operating expenses, the fees institutions can charge, \\\\ninterest rate caps on credit, increased capital requirements, \\\\nand, of course, interchange fees, and contracts between private \\\\nentities, just to name a few. You even sought to increase your \\\\ncontrol over the credit reporting agencies and, therefore, who \\\\ncan get a loan.\\\\n    Taken together, we are looking at massive losses of \\\\nrevenue, and loan and other credit losses, as well as very \\\\nlarge additional costs of compliance. All of this results in \\\\nhigher costs and fewer banking services for customers and fewer \\\\nfinancial institutions to provide those services, all the while \\\\ngiving the government more control over our personal finances. \\\\nAnd it begs the question, at what point can we just publicly \\\\nrecognize that you and the Administration believe that \\\\nfinancial services should be a utility provided to the public \\\\nby the government?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Nothing we have said has suggested that. We \\\\nwant a lot of competing financial firms----\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Mr. Chopra, you say----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. And if you look at the profitability of the----\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Excuse me.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Do you mind if finish this? If you look at the \\\\nprofitability of the finance industry, we have actually seen a \\\\nway in which they have been able to be robust and create new \\\\nproducts and new revenue streams.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Director Chopra, what is happening is that \\\\nthe regulation is running downhill and choking the small \\\\ninstitutions. You sit on the FDIC Board, do you not?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I do.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. You see the mergers and the continued \\\\nconsolidation of the industry, do you not?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We do see it. We do review merger applications.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. I just had a meeting this morning with Fed \\\\nChairman Powell. He talked about the consolidation. It is \\\\nthere. It begs the question then, if you see this, what are you \\\\ndoing about it?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We should have a discussion actually about \\\\nconsolidation, because there are a few places where I think it \\\\nhas driven, and one of the ways some institutions get preferred \\\\ncost of funding advantages because of perceptions about that.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. So, you recognize the problem. Have \\\\nyou taken any actions whatsoever to relieve the regulatory \\\\nburden on small banks?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. One of the things we have done is we have tried \\\\nto make sure we are making our supervision fit for the actual \\\\nrisks. We have shifted much of our supervisory resources to \\\\nlarger players----\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. You sit on the Financial Stability \\\\nOversight Council (FSOC), too, do you not?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I do.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Basel III is coming along. That is a \\\\ndetriment to all of the small businesses, small banks, and \\\\neverybody else. It is going to hugely increase the costs. Can \\\\nwe get your support of trying to minimize the impact of that \\\\nregulation on small banks?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Just to be clear, as I understand it, the rule \\\\nthat the agencies have proposed applies to banks with $100 \\\\nbillion or more in assets.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Director, I just got done talking to some \\\\nbanks, and they were telling me the regulators are saying, \\\\nlook, we know it starts at $100 billion and up, but get ready, \\\\nit is going to roll downhill. The banks are looking at it from \\\\nthe standpoint that if they don&#x27;t comply with it, there is a \\\\nwink and a nod going on here with the regulators that we have \\\\nto be able to live with as well. And what happens is you are \\\\nchasing consumers away from banks because banks are \\\\nconstricting services to the online lenders, offshore stuff \\\\nwhere it is not regulated.\\\\n    I want to quickly get to one more question I have here for \\\\nyou with regards to a letter that I sent to you and the \\\\nDepartment of Justice with regards to warning the creditors \\\\nthat unnecessary and overboard consideration of credit \\\\napplicants&#x27; permanent residency status could violate the Equal \\\\nCredit Opportunity Act (ECOA), despite consideration that the \\\\ncriteria being expressly permitted under ECOA&#x27;s Regulation B. \\\\nAnd I am concerned that by what you are doing, you are adding a \\\\nlot of confusion to the situation here. I know you addressed \\\\nsome of this a while ago, but I am very concerned about the \\\\nconfusion here. We haven&#x27;t gotten a response to our letter yet, \\\\nand, to me, it looks like you are in direct violation of the \\\\nKnow Your Customer law. Can you explain your position on that, \\\\nso it is not in violation, and there is no confusion for the--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Mr. Chairman, may I answer this? I am out of \\\\ntime, but----\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. You have 4 seconds.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. May I answer?\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. You did for everybody else. Go for it.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Okay. I was going to say that, of course, the \\\\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) requirements absolutely are the \\\\ninitial part of the process.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. It is the law.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires, for a non-\\\\nU.S. person, to collect certain documentation. There should be \\\\nnothing that is in conflict of it. The guidance that was issued \\\\nexplicitly allows the consideration of immigration status, but \\\\nI take your point if there is confusion, and we will respond to \\\\nyour----\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. If there is confusion, the law should take \\\\nprecedence, which is KYC, not your joint----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Oh, KYC, of course, has to be----\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. And you will respond for the record.\\\\n    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. We will now go to the gentlewoman from \\\\nOhio, Mrs. Beatty.\\\\n    Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member \\\\nWaters. And good morning and thank you, Director Chopra, for \\\\nbeing here, and thank you for taking your time to testify today \\\\nand for all the work that you do at the CFPB to protect our \\\\nconsumers. And let me join others in thanking you for traveling \\\\nand listening, attending town halls, and going far beyond, and \\\\ncertainly, I have benefited from that. I&#x27;m very proud that a \\\\nfew months ago, you were in my district in Columbus, Ohio, \\\\nmeeting with consumers, and small business owners, and not only \\\\ndid you come, you stayed and I think almost missed your flight \\\\nto answer all of those questions. And I really appreciate that \\\\nbecause we had a very productive roundtable, and I appreciate \\\\nyou taking your work so seriously.\\\\n    I am going to try to get through two questions quickly. \\\\nDirector, we know that the CFPB&#x27;s recently-proposed Section \\\\n1033 rulemaking invites public input on the question of whether \\\\nthe rule should cover EBT accounts. And certainly, as you are \\\\nno doubt aware, and more so for some of my colleagues and the \\\\npublic, EBT account holders, Americans who rely on programs \\\\nlike the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to \\\\nput food on their tables each month, constantly struggle with \\\\naccess to their account information electronically in a \\\\nmarketplace that is highly uncompetitive. My understanding is \\\\nthat the Section 1033 rule aims to improve competition and \\\\nensure consumers have reliable access to their own financial \\\\ndata. Given these goals, it seems to me that it is critically \\\\nimportant that financially at-risk consumers and their EBT \\\\naccounts be included.\\\\n    In addition, the proposed rule gives accountholders \\\\nlegally-enforceable rights to access their data and creates \\\\nnew, strong protections for data covered under the proposal. \\\\nNow, we have seen a massive increase in theft from EBT \\\\naccounts, and increased data access could help EBT \\\\naccountholders detect and report fraud. I know that is a lot.\\\\n    Here&#x27;s the question: Shouldn&#x27;t the CFPB use this \\\\nopportunity to give financially-vulnerable customers control \\\\nover their financial data so they can protect themselves?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Let me just say I totally agree that those who \\\\nare receiving EBT benefits and the transaction data they have, \\\\nthat is very valuable. We are collecting comments on that. I \\\\nwill share with you, and maybe we can talk offline--we are \\\\ntrying to figure out with the USDA and State and local \\\\ngovernments, who really are the issuers of this, how it would \\\\nwork because there is a slightly different way compared to bank \\\\naccounts. But we are trying to work through it, and it has \\\\nopened up some other issues about, do EBT recipients have \\\\naccess to even knowing their balance? So, there are a whole \\\\nbunch of things that I want to look at there.\\\\n    Mrs. Beatty. Okay. Maybe we can talk offline on that. Let \\\\nme kind of switch topics here and now go to the Section 1071 \\\\nsmall business lending rulemaking. For decades before coming to \\\\nCongress, I was a very successful small business owner, and I \\\\nknow we have colleagues on both sides of the aisle who will \\\\nalways say, ``I am a small business owner.&#x27;&#x27; I think it is \\\\ncritical to have a small business lending transparency rule \\\\nthat will help root out discrimination and ensure that small \\\\nbusinesses have access to credit, especially those that are \\\\nowned by females, women like myself, or people of color. And I \\\\nbelieve that some of my colleagues on the other side of the \\\\naisle who claim to be advocates for small businesses, claim \\\\nthat this rule is too onerous for small lenders and are \\\\nadvancing legislation to actually rescind this. I want to give \\\\nyou my last minute to explain to us what provisions have been \\\\nbuilt into the rule to accommodate small lenders, and to set \\\\nthe record straight on how onerous the reporting requirements \\\\nare. Tell us about the resources to make us a little more \\\\ncomfortable?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Based on the comments we received, we increased \\\\nthe threshold pretty substantially. It exempts a number of \\\\nsmall lenders. We reduced some of the collection requirements. \\\\nWe are providing support and implementation guidance on how to \\\\nmake it work. We are giving smaller lenders much more time to \\\\ncomply. We are starting with the very largest banks. We really \\\\ndid our best to implement this law with fidelity, and I hope \\\\nthat we can really see the benefits of it over time.\\\\n    Mrs. Beatty. I know my time is up, but let me just say some \\\\nof those questions came from Democrat and Republican small \\\\nbusiness owners. Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentlewoman from Missouri, Mrs. \\\\nWagner, is now recognized.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Chopra, the \\\\nCFPB&#x27;s credit card late fees proposed rule attempts to help a \\\\nsmall number of credit card customers at the expense of a vast \\\\nmajority of others. Cardholders who never pay late, which the \\\\nCFPB&#x27;s own data and report indicates is 74 percent of all \\\\nAmericans with credit cards, will not benefit from the reduced \\\\nfees, and according to the proposed rule, they could \\\\nexperience, ``higher maintenance fees and lower rewards.&#x27;&#x27; The \\\\nDodd-Frank Act requires the CFPB to consider the cost of its \\\\nrules. How does a rule that, by the CFPB&#x27;s own admission, would \\\\nhelp only a small number of consumers while increasing costs \\\\nfor cardholders across-the-board, survive a cost-benefit \\\\nanalysis?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Respectfully, I think the analysis suggests a \\\\nnumber of different permutations, but in the Credit Card \\\\nAccountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD \\\\nAct), there is a statutory prohibition on fees that are not \\\\nreasonable and proportional. What we are doing is we are \\\\nevaluating the Federal Reserve&#x27;s----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Did you do a cost-benefit analysis?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Just if I could, we are evaluating the first 12 \\\\nyears of that rule, and what we are trying to do is to make \\\\nsure that those firms are able to recover their costs, are able \\\\nto really collect the fees they can, but not necessarily----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Why should responsible cardholders, who pay \\\\ntheir bills on time and typically never pay late fees, be \\\\nforced to subsidize frequent late payers?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If you look at actually the profit and revenue \\\\nmodels of the card issuers, I don&#x27;t think you will see that \\\\nsubsidy occur.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. It absolutely does by virtue of the rule. \\\\nDirector Chopra, if this credit card late fee----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No. Actually, I would just respectfully say \\\\nthat----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. It is my time, respectfully. Director Chopra, \\\\nif this credit card late fee proposal goes into effect, costs \\\\nfor consumers will increase, not because card issuers want to \\\\nincrease costs, but because they are required to do so. The \\\\nprudential regulators require banks to manage and offset their \\\\ncredit risks, which banks would be required to do by taking \\\\nactions such as raising APRs, eliminating rewards, reducing the \\\\namount of credit extended, or even restricting to whom it is \\\\nextended. How has the CFPB accounted for actions that credit \\\\ncard issuers will be forced to take to properly manage credit \\\\nrisk and other prudential regulatory requirements?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. This is a good question. With respect to the \\\\nproposed rule on late fees, we do know that credit card issuers \\\\nengage in risk-based pricing. That is the vast majority of the \\\\nmarket. In other words, they develop a price that is specific \\\\nto a person; they don&#x27;t just have one price for everyone. So \\\\ninasmuch that someone is engaged in not paying, they can \\\\nsubstantially raise their rate. They can take all sorts of \\\\nactions, lowering their credit----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. They will have to by virtue of the rule and by \\\\nvirtue of what the prudential regulators are doing in terms of \\\\nsafety and soundness. Did the CFPB engage with the prudential \\\\nregulators when preparing this proposed rule to ensure that \\\\ncard issuers remain able to meet their safety and soundness \\\\nobligations?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. As part of how we think about----\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. You did? You are telling me that you engaged \\\\nwith the prudential regulators on this?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I am saying, yes.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, we do.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. Then, I don&#x27;t understand. Let me get to my \\\\nquestion then. If you engaged with them, how can the agency \\\\njustify proposing a rule that would implicate these safety and \\\\nsoundness obligations? I don&#x27;t know how you justify it.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Again, as I just mentioned, the way credit card \\\\nissuers originate, they can engage in risk-based pricing, so \\\\nthey are able to raise rates for customers who are risky and \\\\nlower them for those who are less risky. They use a lot of data \\\\nin order to predict that. They have complex scoring models. We \\\\ncertainly try and look at all the factors that are driving \\\\npricing. What we do find right now in the credit card market is \\\\nactually that rates have increased beyond what interest rates \\\\nhave been, so we are looking at all of those dynamics all the \\\\ntime, and I am truly happy to talk through this.\\\\n    Mrs. Wagner. You are taking responsible cardholders who pay \\\\ntheir bills, sir, on time and typically never pay late fees, \\\\nand you are forcing them to subsidize frequent late payers, and \\\\nI see no cost-benefit analysis that says otherwise in this. \\\\nThis proposal is yet another example of the Biden \\\\nAdministration seeking to score political points rather than \\\\nprotecting American consumers. And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back \\\\nthe balance of my time.\\\\n    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from California, Mr. \\\\nVargas, is recognized for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Vargas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to \\\\nthank you and the ranking member for holding this important \\\\nhearing, and see if I can move over a little bit, Director, so \\\\nyou can see me, not that that makes a difference. Again, I want \\\\nto thank you for testifying today, and I thank you for the \\\\ngreat work that you and your Bureau do to protect the consumers \\\\nof my district and across the country.\\\\n    Since 2011, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has \\\\nprotected consumers from unfair, deceptive, and abusive \\\\nbusiness practices. To date, the CFPB has returned over $20 \\\\nbillion to 205,000,000 consumers. The Bureau is delivering \\\\nresults for students, veterans, and many other Americans across \\\\nthe country, and I appreciate that, and so do the polls. \\\\nNotably, according to a recent nonpartisan poll, over 82 \\\\npercent of Americans support the CFPB and its mission to \\\\nprotect consumers in the financial marketplace, and I have to \\\\ntell you, from my district, that seems to be correct. I get so \\\\nmany compliments for the work that you have done and your \\\\nBureau has done. I know it is tough. I know it is tough \\\\nsometimes up here not being able to answer all the questions \\\\nbecause you don&#x27;t get time, but I appreciate the work you have \\\\ndone.\\\\n    Now, in the last question, you didn&#x27;t have enough time to \\\\nanswer. Is there a subsidy then from the people who pay their \\\\ncredit cards on time and those who don&#x27;t?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No. There is no forced subsidy from one group \\\\nto another. We are trying to follow the law and be able to \\\\nimplement that faithfully, and you must understand that \\\\nunderwriting is increasingly individualized. It is not one \\\\nprice that anyone pays. It is risk-based.\\\\n    Mr. Vargas. The same thing happens in insurance, as you \\\\nknow.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Vargas. Absolutely, so I appreciate that. Now, in fact, \\\\none of the things I do want to talk about a little bit, and it \\\\nhas been talked about here, is cost-benefit analysis. How do \\\\nyou determine that? For example, discrimination against women, \\\\nhow would you weigh that? How many hours or what price is it \\\\nagainst the discrimination that a woman feels, the humiliation, \\\\nthe opportunities that are missed? How do you weigh that, \\\\nbecause that has been brought up here and hasn&#x27;t been \\\\nexplained, as if a woman who is discriminated against, all of a \\\\nsudden because she lost a thousand dollars, you have a thousand \\\\ndollars&#x27; worth of time over here, it is an equivalent. I don&#x27;t \\\\nbelieve that personally, but how do you weigh that?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. When there were widespread illegal \\\\nmortgage foreclosures and there was an attempt at cost-benefit \\\\nanalysis, I believe one of the takeaways was that the children \\\\nin the home of an illegal foreclosure actually lost three grade \\\\nlevels--I may not have that exactly right. You are right that \\\\nit is very hard to put a price on that, and we did a rule to \\\\nimplement legislation you all passed on survivors of human \\\\ntrafficking and repairing their life. It is very, very hard to \\\\nput a price on that, but, again, we do try our best to make \\\\nsure we are limiting costs, but sometimes the benefits, when it \\\\ncomes to getting your life back, are extraordinary.\\\\n    Mr. Vargas. And I hope you keep that in mind, because I \\\\nknow there is a lot of pressure to just do a simple cost-\\\\nbenefit analysis, dollars and cents, which doesn&#x27;t take into \\\\naccount the family, the humiliation, the standard of living, \\\\nreally, that we all have, the belief and faith that we have in \\\\nthe government, and maybe a lot of us in God and other things, \\\\nbecause you have to have right and wrong. I believe still there \\\\nis right and there is wrong, and sometimes to do right costs a \\\\nlot. I hope that you keep taking that into account instead of \\\\njust some crude cost-benefit analysis.\\\\n    I do want to talk a little bit about AI. It is something \\\\nthat scares me, to be honest with you. Maybe I have seen too \\\\nmany darn movies about it, but it does seem like something \\\\nthat, as Mr. Foster said, unleashed into humanity could do \\\\ngreat damage, especially to our financial system. Could you \\\\ncomment on that?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I certainly think the financial system, \\\\nespecially when it is highly automated, which it is, when you \\\\nintroduce very-opaque algorithms into it, I think there are \\\\nsome worries about systemic risk of that, the extent to which \\\\ntremors could turn into earthquakes. I hope that you all can be \\\\nthinking about all the various ways that there could be risk \\\\ncreated. Now, AI, in some ways, in financial services, has been \\\\nused forever----\\\\n    Mr. Vargas. For sure.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. ----for credit scores, and other things. We \\\\nhave to make sure some of the existing laws on the books are \\\\nbeing followed, and that is really what has been our focus. It \\\\nis a much longer discussion about how we deal with generative \\\\nAI and fraud, the lending algorithms, but we are trying to make \\\\nsure we are beefing up our technology core so that we really \\\\nunderstand what is going on before it is too late.\\\\n    Mr. Vargas. My time is up. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. [presiding]. The gentleman yields back. The Chair \\\\nnow recognizes himself for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Director Chopra, let me start with your policy statement \\\\ndefining, ``abusive practices.&#x27;&#x27; Do you believe that financial \\\\nservices companies should be held liable for not complying with \\\\nnovel guidance or regulations that you have only recently \\\\npublished on a retroactive basis?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No, and, in fact, the abusive policy statement \\\\nreally was an attempt to try and avoid situations where people \\\\ndidn&#x27;t know.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. I appreciate that, and you have said that before \\\\nin this committee. I do appreciate that. So, can I take it from \\\\nyour testimony that your policy statement will only apply \\\\nprospectively?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The issue is that the statute has always \\\\nexisted, but----\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Okay. Fair enough. Reclaiming my time, I am \\\\ngenerally glad to hear what you just said, because I don&#x27;t \\\\nthink it is fair to punish companies for operating within the \\\\nboundaries of the law at the time the company was engaged in an \\\\nact or practice that was lawful at the time, even under the \\\\npreexisting statute. I do, however, plan to introduce a bill \\\\nwhich ensures that the Bureau does just that and does not try \\\\nto retroactively apply new requirements onto activities that \\\\noccurred in the past. And I would appreciate your input on that \\\\nand your working with me on that legislation to make sure that \\\\nwe are achieving our mutual goal.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. And I want this to be durable and not ping pong \\\\nand not----\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Right. Great.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Sorry.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Great. Director Chopra, if a small business \\\\nbegins a loan application process, can a lender under your \\\\nSection 1071 proposal disclose to them that they are required \\\\nto collect information under the direction of the Federal \\\\nGovernment?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I need to look at the specific regulation, but \\\\nmy understanding is that even the model form makes very clear \\\\nthat this is a government requirement.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Okay. Does a small business loan applicant have \\\\nthe right to refuse to provide this data under your proposal?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. It is actually not under the proposal. It \\\\nis in the statute.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Great. I agree, it is in the statute. So, under \\\\n1071 and under the statute, small businesses are not legally \\\\nobligated to provide data in connection with any application of \\\\ncredit, but do you believe a small business owner should know \\\\nwhy an institution, before any underwriting occurs, is \\\\ncollecting demographic information about them?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If I understand your question, I think, yes, \\\\nthat is right, and in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), \\\\nI believe there is a similar type of framework.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I would need to check.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Do you recognize that if a small business owner \\\\nfails to understand why the data is being collected, it could \\\\nlead to confusion and misunderstanding and potential liability \\\\nfor a financial institution? In other words, if they are asked \\\\nto disclose their race or their ethnicity or their LGBT status \\\\nbefore underwriting occurs, then that loan application is \\\\ndenied, that could lead to confusion as to the basis for the \\\\ndenial of the application? You do understand that?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I understand that.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Yes. And based on your response, I believe you \\\\nwould agree with me that providing a simple document to \\\\nconsumers or small business owners explaining all of this would \\\\nhelp clear up confusion in the small business lending space.\\\\n    As chairman, I am asking myself for unanimous consent to \\\\nsubmit for the record a potential questionnaire crafted by the \\\\nKentucky Bankers Association that would do just that.\\\\n    Without objection, it is so ordered.\\\\n    Director Chopra, my constituents who provide small business \\\\nloans in my district in Kentucky tell me that your 1071 rule \\\\nwould force them to exit small business lending and will, \\\\ntherefore, decrease availability and increase the cost of \\\\ncredit for small Main Street borrowers. I believe this \\\\nquestionnaire could help clarify the need for, or the lack of \\\\nany need for, this data collection effort and reduce incentives \\\\nfor firms to exit the market because of fear of legal \\\\nrepercussions.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. By the way, I am very open to that.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Okay. I will share it with you, and I appreciate \\\\nyour feedback. My final question is about funding and the \\\\nSupreme Court and what the Supreme Court is about ready to do. \\\\nDid you see that the Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Services and \\\\nGeneral Government Appropriations bill that we just took up in \\\\nthe Congress, that the Congress funded the CFPB in that bill at \\\\ncurrent levels? Did you notice that?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I did.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. And did you notice that Republicans, the \\\\nRepublican Majority, with Democrats, voted down an amendment \\\\nthat zeroed out the CFPB&#x27;s funding?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I didn&#x27;t catch that, but your colleague \\\\nmentioned it, yes.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Yes. Clearly, some Republicans voted to zero it \\\\nout, but that amendment failed. I want you to take notice of \\\\nthat, and I want the Supreme Court to take notice of that \\\\nbecause it demonstrates that the Congress is not about \\\\neliminating consumer protection or the Bureau. It is about \\\\nupholding the Constitution and the separation of powers, and if \\\\nour bill were enacted, the agency would continue to operate. \\\\nThe only difference would be that Congress would oversee the \\\\nagency spending in the same way it does for most other consumer \\\\nprotection agencies, and I believe it is time for Congress to \\\\nregain its most important oversight tool, and that is the power \\\\nof the purse.\\\\n    And with that, I will recognize the gentleman from \\\\nIllinois, Mr. Casten.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Thank you, Mr. Barr. Director Chopra, it&#x27;s \\\\ngreat to see you again. I want to follow up on the conversation \\\\nwe had last June. We talked at that time about the 2022 \\\\ncomplaint bulletin that had been issued looking at complaints \\\\non digital assets that, I think, specifically said fraud, \\\\ntheft, hacks, and scams are a significant problem in the crypto \\\\nasset markets, and it appears to be getting worse. I am just \\\\ncurious, in the last 5 months, are things getting better, are \\\\nthings getting worse, or are they about the same?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I don&#x27;t have a great answer on this. It can \\\\noften be difficult to determine. We look at our complaints. I \\\\nwill say that people have lost a lot of money through hacks.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. They have been cleaned out there, and another \\\\nthing is that it used to be gift cards. People would ask \\\\nsomeone to purchase a gift card in a fraud context, and now, it \\\\nis often a new technology like this.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It is something that the Justice Department and \\\\nothers were trying to deal with, especially when it comes to \\\\ntargeting the elderly.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. I appreciate the confusion, and part of the \\\\nreason I asked the question is, we have seen a lot of public \\\\nactions by Treasury, by the Justice Department, and of course, \\\\nthe Binance news and the shutdown that is there, and obviously, \\\\na lot of information will come out of there. While we were \\\\nsitting here, I think the Treasury Department just announced \\\\nthat they are sanctioning Sinbad, a virtual currency mixer that \\\\nis being used to launder stolen assets, primarily to fund the \\\\nNorth Korean nuclear program, as far as I can tell from the \\\\npublic reporting. The Binance reporting said that the platform \\\\nwas being used to fund child abusers, sanctions evaders, and a \\\\nwhole host of bad terrorist groups, and remarkably, never filed \\\\na single suspicious activity report (SAR). And I am not ranting \\\\nto criticize them, but I am just curious if that is a sign that \\\\nwe have this under control or are we just getting at the tip of \\\\nthe iceberg----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think when we talk about new uses of data, \\\\nand certainly when it comes to AI, digital assets, there are \\\\nall sorts of ways that we constantly have to think about how it \\\\ncould be misused and not just----\\\\n    Mr. Casten. Can you just, on that point, in the 2022 report \\\\nyou talked about the use of crypto for, ``pig butchering.&#x27;&#x27; Can \\\\nyou just explain for the committee what that is, as it is \\\\nrelated to this thing about--I guess it is like a high-tech \\\\ngift card?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. A major way in which people are defrauded is \\\\noften through romance scams, including through online dating \\\\nwebsites, and social media. And, ``pig butchering,&#x27;&#x27; is the \\\\nconcept of building trust over time, to, at the end, ultimately \\\\nwipe them out of their financial assets. And you see, \\\\nunfortunately, a lot of that, and it can be very challenging, \\\\nparticularly when the fraudster has so much information about \\\\nthe target that they might be able to really trust them.\\\\n    Mr. Casten. This shouldn&#x27;t need to be said, but I am proud \\\\nto say that we have a bipartisan opposition to, ``pig \\\\nbutchering,&#x27;&#x27; to funding North Korea nuclear programs, to \\\\nfunding Hamas, and to child trafficking. I think all of us on \\\\nthis committee want to make sure that we stop those things.\\\\n    I am troubled by the fact that there is a common nexus in \\\\nall those, which is crypto networks that are used to evade \\\\nanti-money laundering rules. And I think we on this committee \\\\nhave some accountability to do with the fact that just within \\\\nthis term, the majority has passed two bills on a straight \\\\nparty line basis that would actually limit the ability of \\\\nregulators like yourself to pursue anti-money laundering rules, \\\\nto even have any authority to go after folks who are using \\\\nunhosted wallets, these cryptographic assets. And if we \\\\ngenuinely oppose these things, we should stop the ways they are \\\\ngetting used.\\\\n    I just want to raise a concern with some public reporting \\\\nthat has come out this week that Chairman McHenry has been \\\\nthreatening to hold up the Defense Authorization Act unless we \\\\nget a crypto-friendly bill, which is not going to make this \\\\nbetter. And there has also been some public reporting that \\\\nperhaps the currency will be to take out some protections \\\\nagainst fentanyl use, which, of course, has also been listed in \\\\na lot of these reports as one of the common uses of \\\\ncryptographic money.\\\\n    I realize this isn&#x27;t your concern, but I want to thank \\\\nRanking Member Waters for her efforts to block that. And I want \\\\nto thank Chairman Brown and the Senate for blocking that, and \\\\njust urge them to continue to do so because we do need a fully-\\\\nfunded Defense Authorization Act. We do need to make sure that \\\\nour financial regulators have the tools to shut down money \\\\nlaundering. And my goodness, we would like to put a stop to pig \\\\nbutchering, terrorism, North Korean nuclear programs, and child \\\\ntrafficking. Thank you, Director Chopra, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The gentleman yields back. Let me remind Members \\\\nto refrain from referencing the chairman when he is not in a \\\\nposition to represent his side of the story, and represent his \\\\nviews in response. With that, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. \\\\nWilliams, is now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Williams of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director, \\\\nit&#x27;s good to see you again.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Same.\\\\n    Mr. Williams of Texas. Consistently, you have come before \\\\nthis committee saying you would protect the interests of small \\\\nbusiness. You have said that today. Yet, ever since you joined \\\\nthe CFPB, your agency continues to add burdensome requirements \\\\nwithout consideration of their impact on small business and \\\\nsmall lenders, and you know I am a small business person. For \\\\nthe past 6 months, I have been consistently hearing from small \\\\nand community bankers back in my district in Texas and across \\\\nthe country on how unprepared and terrified they are about the \\\\nCFPB&#x27;s Section 1071 Small Business Data Collection Rule. Small \\\\nlenders are concerned that the complicated reporting \\\\nrequirements, which add 81 new data fields, will tie up loan \\\\nofficers and increase compliance costs, ultimately forcing them \\\\nto pass these costs down to whom? The customer. Furthermore, \\\\nsmall lenders are worried this rule will push the industry \\\\ntowards a standardized small business loan product and kill \\\\nrelationship banking, which all of us are familiar with and \\\\nhave grown up with. This overly-burdensome rule will limit the \\\\nbanks&#x27; lending abilities and make it harder for small \\\\nbusinesses to access the capital they need.\\\\n    Now, I have been working with members of this committee and \\\\nthe Senate to push back against the rule, and I am glad to say \\\\nthat our CRA is coming to the House Floor for a vote this week. \\\\nSo, it is critical that we pass this bill to overturn the rule, \\\\nstop the regulatory overreach, and protect Main Street America. \\\\nThis will be an easy yes-or-no answer for you, I think, \\\\nDirector. Congress is elected by the American public, and you \\\\nare an appointed bureaucrat. The question is, will you respect \\\\nthe views of the American people and overturn the 1071 rule \\\\nshould both Chambers vote in favor of nullifying this rule? Yes \\\\nor no?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If it is enacted into law, pursuant to the \\\\nCongressional Review Act (CRA), of course, we will comply with \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Mr. Williams of Texas. Thank you. The funding structure of \\\\nthe CFPB minimizes congressional oversight and budget authority \\\\nand, instead, relies on allocations from the Federal Reserve. \\\\nThis unconventional funding approach has sparked numerous legal \\\\nchallenges, raising concerns about the Bureau&#x27;s lack of \\\\ntransparency and accountability to the American people. This \\\\nfunding mechanism is vastly different than other Federal \\\\nbanking agencies. In order to have a check on the CFPB&#x27;s power, \\\\nit is imperative that your operations be subject to \\\\ncongressional operations or appropriations.\\\\n    So, Director, while we wait for the court&#x27;s decision on \\\\nyour agency&#x27;s funding, how are you ensuring that you are \\\\nremaining transparent and accountable to the American people?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Respectfully, we try and do everything we can \\\\nwith respect to our spending. We have not only complied with \\\\nthe statutory requirements on audits, providing reports, we \\\\nhave tried to answer all sorts of questions that people may \\\\nhave and, frankly, taken a lot of feedback. We have also looked \\\\nvery carefully at spending that can be eliminated. We have \\\\nspent below our budget cap that is given to us from the Federal \\\\nReserve and have not even requested the full amount. We \\\\ncontinue to look at how we are going to have a workforce that \\\\ncan help us deliver what Congress said, but, of course, we \\\\nawait the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling. The CFPB, the Fed, the OCC, \\\\nthe FDIC, and others are funded very similarly, so we are all \\\\nlooking forward to getting a conclusion to that issue.\\\\n    Mr. Williams of Texas. Okay. The CFPB has indicated that \\\\nthey are in the pre-rule stage of creating a new overdraft rule \\\\nthat would reclassify overdraft fees and finance charges. This \\\\nproposal is widely unreasonable and burdensome for consumers \\\\nand providers. Overdraft is a key tool that allows consumers to \\\\nwithdraw more money than is available in their accounts so that \\\\nthey may make a payment with these temporary funds. With the \\\\nrising cost of everyday needs due to the Biden economics that \\\\nwe see today, this feature is helpful in situations that are \\\\ndire because of Bidenomics, and this feature is helpful in \\\\nsituations where a consumer has unexpected expenses or delays \\\\nin income. Overdrafts allow them to continue with the purchase \\\\nof whatever they may need, so this safety net is key for \\\\nconsumers and must be protected.\\\\n    So, Director, is the CFPB actively working to eliminate \\\\noverdraft programs that consumers rely on to meet day-to-day \\\\nneeds, like groceries or other essentials?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. As I have shared before, we do believe that all \\\\nforms of credit, including overdraft services, have a role to \\\\nplay. Our focus has been to focus on where it has been \\\\nillegally done, and we have received requests to look at a \\\\nrulemaking to provide clarity, but there is not an effort to \\\\neliminate that need that you share.\\\\n    Mr. Williams of Texas. Okay. Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The gentleman yields back. The gentlewoman from \\\\nTexas, Ms. Garcia, is now recognized.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is always great \\\\nto have you with us, Director Chopra. You are always a breath \\\\nof fresh air, always willing to respond to all the questions \\\\nand with such candor and precision. I was a little taken aback \\\\nby my colleagues&#x27; comments that you are running your agency in \\\\na lawless manner, acting outside of the law. I feel like I know \\\\na little bit about the law, being a lawyer and a former judge, \\\\nand I think if you were doing anything lawless or outside of \\\\nthe law, I would probably be the first one to raise the red \\\\nflag. Can you assure the public today and those listening that \\\\nyou are, in fact, following the law and doing everything that \\\\nis mandated by Congress?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, and we take those congressional mandates \\\\nseriously. We are implementing each and every piece that has \\\\nbeen required of us, and we just take that responsibility \\\\nseriously.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Right. And as you responded to an earlier \\\\nquestion, if the law is passed and is signed into law, of \\\\ncourse, you are going to follow that law.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, and I actually would recommend you putting \\\\ndeadlines on that because it makes sure that it happens. We do \\\\nhave issues with other agencies where it is passed and never \\\\ngets done.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Thank you. It is reassuring, and I had full \\\\nconfidence that would be your response, but I thought it was \\\\nnecessary to put that in the record because under your \\\\nleadership, the CFPB has taken unprecedented action to combat \\\\njunk fees and medical debt, while holding credit card reporting \\\\ncompanies accountable and curbing predatory lenders. As always, \\\\nyou have been there up front with a commitment to protecting \\\\nour nation&#x27;s consumers.\\\\n    I would like to begin by discussing your outstanding \\\\nefforts to tackle the junk fee situation. Prior to today&#x27;s \\\\nhearing, I reviewed a useful fact sheet about the CFPB&#x27;s whole-\\\\nof-government approach to addressing junk fees, and it briefly \\\\nmentioned the CFPB&#x27;s enforcement actions against MoneyGram, an \\\\ninternational remittance provider. This was of great interest \\\\nto me because, as you know, my district is 77-percent Latino, \\\\nand many people in my district either know someone or have \\\\nrelatives in Mexico. And, in fact, Texas has the second-highest \\\\namount of remittances that go to Mexico within the United \\\\nStates. In 2021, in fact, $7.7 billion in remittances were sent \\\\nfrom Texas to Mexico, making up 15.9 percent of all \\\\ntransactions.\\\\n    In 2012, the CFPB implemented its remittance rule, \\\\nrequiring companies that offer remittances to provide \\\\nconsistent disclosure regarding the price of a transfer before \\\\nthe consumer makes a payment. Less than 10 years later, \\\\nconsumer and immigration groups have found that U.S. consumers \\\\nlose approximately $8.7 billion in hidden fees due to the \\\\nexchange rate markups.\\\\n    In June of 2023, you testified before this committee and \\\\nrecognized this issue where remittances are advertised at zero \\\\ncost, but a hidden foreign exchange markup is added. These junk \\\\nfees impact a large number of my constituents who send \\\\nremittances to their families. Director Chopra, what action has \\\\nthe CFPB taken since June to eliminate these junk fees within \\\\nremittances, or what other action can we expect from you soon?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Let me first share that remittances are such an \\\\nimportant market for us to be focused on. We also know that \\\\nremittances are a key part of U.S. national security policy as \\\\nwell, given the volume that takes place, so let me share this. \\\\nI do share your concerns about advertising, especially that \\\\nsomething is free, when, in reality, it has a big cost.\\\\n    We have actually taken a number of enforcement actions over \\\\nthe last 2 years, including fairly recently, to go after \\\\nviolations of the remittance rule. I think as more consumers \\\\nare doing this digitally, we are going to need to evaluate \\\\nwhether those rules need any updates so that they are fit for \\\\nthe modern times. We do see that there are many people who are \\\\nsending them through apps, and we want to make sure they can \\\\ncompare, get a good offer, and really know what they are \\\\ngetting into.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Great. Also, I read your Semiannual Report, \\\\nwhich notes the efforts to diversify in terms of your \\\\ncontractors, with 43 percent of contracts going to minority- \\\\nand women-owned programs. However, when we looked at the \\\\nbreakdown of the contract, it only showed .2 percent--not even \\\\n1 percent--.2 percent of the dollars spent went to Latino-owned \\\\nbusinesses. What steps is the CFPB taking to ensure that Latino \\\\ncontractors are at the table and get some of those contracts?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We have our Office of Minority and Women \\\\nInclusion that is required to oversee that. I am happy to \\\\nanswer more questions for the record.\\\\n    Ms. Garcia. Mr. Chairman, I will submit those in writing. \\\\nThank you.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. Thank you. The gentlelady&#x27;s time has expired. The \\\\ngentleman from Georgia, Mr. Loudermilk, is now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chopra, thank \\\\nyou for being here and for being willing to answer questions. I \\\\nagree with some of my colleagues that there are some things \\\\nthat we share that are important, and one is data privacy. That \\\\nis something I have been working on since I have been here in \\\\nCongress, and it seems that we continue to go backwards, not \\\\nforwards. I am talking about the Federal Government in general. \\\\nOne of the things about data privacy is it is intrinsically \\\\ntied to data security, and one of the best ways to protect data \\\\nis to not have it. You don&#x27;t have to protect what you don&#x27;t \\\\nhave, so only collect what you need, but that is a conversation \\\\nfor another day.\\\\n    I want to ask about the data breach that happened in \\\\nFebruary of this year. Obviously, you are aware of this as you \\\\nhave communicated this in the past, but I do want to ask some \\\\nquestions about that, especially as early as 2014, the Bureau \\\\nwas warned that vulnerabilities in its information security \\\\nprogram put it at risk of a breach, and the latest Office of \\\\nthe Inspector General (OIG) report indicates the Bureau hadn&#x27;t \\\\naddressed any of these cybersecurity action items that were \\\\npreviously recommended. Have you implemented any of these \\\\nrecommendations since the publication of the report? This \\\\nreport was in February of 2023.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We have gotten from our Federal \\\\nInformation Security Modernization Act (FISMA) audit, our OIG, \\\\nand our third-party review, a whole slew of things that, over \\\\ntime, we have been able to successfully implement. I want to \\\\ngive you the appropriate details of that, and we do know which \\\\nones have been fulfilled, and we work with the Inspector \\\\nGeneral to see if it is also to their satisfaction. But let me \\\\njust share that, of course, the misappropriation of data that \\\\noccurred earlier this year was extremely serious. One of my \\\\nreflections on it is that we are talking about an insider \\\\nthreat.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. So, part of what we are doing is not just \\\\nmaking sure that systems are not penetrable from outside, but \\\\nalso from the inside, making sure that there is limited access, \\\\nonly where there needs to be. There will employees who have \\\\naccess to information. We have made some system changes, too, \\\\nto limit the information that is accessible. I can confirm the \\\\nissue was not related to any sort of intelligence operation by \\\\na foreign state actor. The individual is no longer employed at \\\\nthe agency, but there is work to do as it relates to insider \\\\nthreats across the----\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Right, and in a lot of cases, access by \\\\nforeign actors, criminals, come as the result of improper \\\\nactions by an internal operator, as we saw with Equifax a while \\\\nback, right?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. And ultimately, we know it was not just \\\\nEquifax, but Marriott, and the Office of Personnel Management \\\\n(OPM).\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It was bad actors affiliated with the Chinese \\\\nGovernment, that we have to make sure that we know this data is \\\\nused for all sorts of purposes.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. I just want to ask you specifically some of \\\\nthese questions and bring it back up.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Sure.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. You may not have the answer now, but if you \\\\ncould respond in writing for the record, that would be great. \\\\nThere are specifically three in the OIG report. The first was \\\\nto develop and implement a cybersecurity risk register and \\\\nassociated process to identify and manage organizational-wide \\\\ncybersecurity risks. These were showing that they had not been \\\\ncompleted by February of 2023, but the response from the Bureau \\\\nwas, ``implementation in progress,&#x27;&#x27; and, ``estimated \\\\ncompletion is this year,&#x27;&#x27; and we are running out of time. The \\\\nother two, and I can provide these to you, all three of these--\\\\nwe will provide them in written format.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Of course.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. If you can respond where you are on these, \\\\nI would appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. On that one, we know that part of it was, I \\\\nbelieve we were procuring a new system, and it would replace \\\\nand implement something. We have tried to also complete these \\\\nin a way that is deliberate and also to the satisfaction of our \\\\noffice.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. I am running out of time quickly, and \\\\nI need to ask this: How and when were the victims of the CFPB \\\\ndata breach notified? Congress wasn&#x27;t notified until May. Were \\\\nthe businesses or the individuals that were potentially \\\\nbreached, were they notified at any time----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. ----and if so, was it before Congress or \\\\nafter Congress?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We notified Congress completely pursuant to the \\\\nguidance, and actually, when we found out, we looked to see \\\\nwhen the data may have left the system by the insider threat. \\\\nWe did the customer notifications, and we had to work with our \\\\nsupervised entity, because sometimes it was complicated, and my \\\\nstaff just shared that Congress was notified in March.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Right, but when were the customers \\\\nnotified, before or after Congress?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We actually didn&#x27;t have their contact \\\\ninformation in most situations, so we had to work with the \\\\ninstitutions.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The gentlewoman from Massachusetts, Ms. Pressley, \\\\nis recognized.\\\\n    Ms. Pressley. It&#x27;s good to see you, Director Chopra. I \\\\nalways smile when I see you because I actually know what it is \\\\nthat you do. I am grateful for your service and certainly your \\\\nresilience. Despite the destructive efforts by Republicans to \\\\nsabotage the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I commend \\\\nyou on your work to support vulnerable consumers. From cracking \\\\ndown on junk fees and predatory lenders, to working to remove \\\\nburdensome medical debt from credit reports, and protecting \\\\nseniors against fraud, the CFPB&#x27;s record speaks for itself.\\\\n    Now, I want to talk about the $2-trillion crisis that is \\\\nstudent debt. You have heard the expression, ``like a dog with \\\\na bone.&#x27;&#x27; I am no dog, but I am a Congresswoman with a cause, \\\\nand some of my colleagues may be tired of me bringing up \\\\nstudent debt, but imagine how tired our constituents are of \\\\nliving with it. For borrowers who live in my district, the \\\\nMassachusetts 7th, whether it is a father juggling part-time \\\\njobs, or a third grade teacher who spent a decade in the \\\\nclassroom making payments month to month, their situations are \\\\nas precarious now as they were 3 years ago when payments were \\\\nfirst paused, and student loan servicers are not making it any \\\\neasier: high wait times when you call; false information when \\\\nyou get someone on the phone; and wrong billing amounts when \\\\nthey ask for money.\\\\n    Just last month, MOHELA, the largest student loan servicer \\\\nin the country, proved its incompetence: 78,000 borrowers \\\\nreceived the wrong information for the SAVE Income-Driven \\\\nRepayment Plan; 153,000 borrowers did not receive a bill until \\\\nafter it was due; and for the ones who did receive a bill, \\\\n21,000 borrowers received bills that were very high and far \\\\nfrom correct, including some who received a bill for $100,000. \\\\nNow, imagine opening your mail and seeing a bill for $100,000. \\\\nThis is ridiculous, and it is proof that the CFPB&#x27;s work is \\\\nmore critical now than ever before.\\\\n    Director Chopra, could you describe what steps the Bureau \\\\nis taking to protect student loan borrowers from the gross \\\\nincompetence of student loan servicers?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Those servicers, just like mortgage servicers, \\\\nimpact people&#x27;s lives so much. We have seen, over the course of \\\\nthe past 15 years, illegal foreclosures and other harms in the \\\\nmortgage market. But in the student loan market, a wrongful \\\\ndefault or a major error can hit people so hard early in their \\\\nfinancial life and eliminate their ability to even get an auto \\\\nloan or do anything else. They may not be banks, but they have \\\\nto follow the same laws. We are allocating real attention to \\\\nthis, including the return to repayment, because many of those \\\\nservicers shrunk quite a bit during the payment pause, scaling \\\\nup, and we will be releasing more information about some of our \\\\nfindings. We have taken enforcement actions, and it is very, \\\\nvery important that people are not the victims of an unlawful \\\\npractice.\\\\n    Ms. Pressley. Thank you. And, Director Chopra, what is your \\\\nadvice--sort of consider this a PSA, if you will--to borrowers \\\\nwho are dealing with predatory student loan servicers, \\\\nscammers, and malicious actors?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly, be very, very cautious about talking \\\\nto someone who isn&#x27;t the loan servicer. They may be using \\\\ninformation about you in order to get you to pay something that \\\\nyou don&#x27;t owe them. We also say if you are having trouble, \\\\nplease file a complaint. We are often able to get those \\\\nindividuals across the country fixes and sometimes clear \\\\nanswers on what really needs to happen. This whole thing has to \\\\nwork, or there are going to be big problems.\\\\n    Ms. Pressley. Thank you, Director Chopra. Like many \\\\nAmericans, I took on student loans to pursue higher education, \\\\nnot because I wanted to, but because I had to. It was the only \\\\nway. It took me over 20 years to pay them off while I was a \\\\ncaregiver to my mother and often working multiple jobs, \\\\nincluding as an aide in the House and in the Senate, but I want \\\\nan easier road for the next person. The people demand and \\\\ndeserve student debt cancellation. In the meantime, we must \\\\nprovide relief for our borrowers wherever and however we can, \\\\nand that includes holding student loan servicers accountable \\\\nfor their incompetence. I thank you again, Director Chopra, and \\\\nyour entire dedicated team, and I look forward to continuing to \\\\nwork together.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The gentlelady yields back. The gentlelady--no, \\\\nthe gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Davidson, is now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. I&#x27;m glad we got that right. Thanks, Director \\\\nChopra. I appreciate you being here, and I appreciate your work \\\\non privacy. I have really enjoyed the prominence of the Fourth \\\\nAmendment in this hearing, and I know you know that I share \\\\nyour fondness of the respect for privacy and the sense that it \\\\nreally needs a lot of attention right now.\\\\n    I have been developing a bill called the Payment Privacy \\\\nAct that would ban the sale or distribution of consumer \\\\nfinancial data unless the consumer provides express consent. \\\\nThis consent would only be legal if the consumer can identify \\\\nwho will receive their data at the time the consent is given. \\\\nWe still have a few things to work out, but it is close to \\\\nbeing done, and most notably, we are trying to make sure that \\\\nenforcement and damages provisions match the impact of the data \\\\nbreaches. This is clearly something that you touch on with some \\\\nof the rulemakings that you have been in process with, and I \\\\nlook forward to continuing to work with you and your office on \\\\nthat, so I appreciate that.\\\\n    But as we talk about Section 1033, one component of it \\\\nwould allow tokenized account numbers when making data \\\\navailable to consumer-permission third parties, so they could \\\\ntokenize it, it kind of anonymizes the data in a sense. This \\\\nmeans the account identifier would mask that identity from the \\\\nthird party. Has the Bureau considered any alternative \\\\napproaches to protecting consumer account information?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. In many ways, Congressman, we also have to \\\\nthink ahead. I have talked to some of you on this committee \\\\nabout quantum decryption and the risk of re-identification, and \\\\nwe want to think of ways that are timeless, so we are very open \\\\nto feedback on other alternatives. We don&#x27;t want any sort of \\\\nspecific technology built in, but I do fear that if we don&#x27;t \\\\nmake sure that the rule has some real data protections, it will \\\\nbe a haven for misuse.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. I think that is the point of not just \\\\nprotecting the consumer privacy. They clearly didn&#x27;t disclose \\\\nit. This is a way to bypass the fact that they haven&#x27;t \\\\ndisclosed it and technology kind of escalates.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I see. That could sidestep it.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Oh, I&#x27;m sorry. I misunderstood.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. And I am also fond of zero knowledge proofs, \\\\nfor what it is worth, and this touches on a transition point to \\\\ndigital assets briefly.\\\\n    Director Chopra, the former Director of the CFPB, Director \\\\nKraninger, previously stated that the CFPB&#x27;s authority over \\\\ndigital assets is murky at best because there is a lack of \\\\njurisdictional clarity. Given that the, ``larger payment \\\\nparticipant rulemaking,&#x27;&#x27; attempts to sweep in digital assets, \\\\nhow do you see the scope of the CFPB&#x27;s role in digital assets \\\\nand, in particular, with respect to protecting self-custody and \\\\nprivacy?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. It is really when it is being used for a \\\\nconsumer payment, so we do have a lot of nonbank payment apps. \\\\nTo the extent to which they are using something that is just \\\\nfor a consumer payment, there is case law which shows that is \\\\ncovered under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and that \\\\nis what we supervise for. I think we have tried to be very \\\\ncautious about this, and also, inasmuch that you are \\\\nlegislating on it, we are happy to provide any input on it. But \\\\nwhen it comes to that, we are really trying to address those \\\\nlarge payment apps that we have to make sure are following the \\\\nsame set of laws as the banks.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. Right. Yes. The general trend is to make \\\\neverything account-based, and one of the best things is self-\\\\ncustody. So if I have cash, my identity is pretty well \\\\nprotected.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. And if I want to exchange that with someone \\\\nelse, then we don&#x27;t really have a lot of risk of data breach or \\\\nprivacy issues. Now, for many of my colleagues, that level of \\\\nprivacy is too much privacy. They like the spying-on-people \\\\nfeatures of account-based systems, and I am really concerned \\\\nthat we protect self-custody because that is at the core of \\\\nprivacy. That is at the core of protecting your money because \\\\nsomeone&#x27;s not skimming part of it for providing services unless \\\\nyou want them to.\\\\n    One other thing that I just want to touch on is that in the \\\\nlast numbers I saw on Buy Now, Pay Later for Black Friday and \\\\nCyber Monday, spending was $940 million. That is about a 42-\\\\npercent jump over last year. The pros of Buy Now, Pay Later are \\\\nreally apparent. There is no credit check. It is interest free \\\\nup front. So if you want to buy something for, say, $200, and \\\\nyou pay $50 now, you can pay 3 more payments of $50 and do it. \\\\nDoes that, at some point, especially if you don&#x27;t make that \\\\nnext payment, start to look a lot like credit? You did some \\\\nwork on this.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We are trying to make sure that those \\\\nsimilar types of use cases have similar treatment. Buy Now, Pay \\\\nLater is an option for many, many people, and you are right, it \\\\nhas grown, and there are a lot more providers. I think there \\\\nare some issues, some credit reporting issues and other things \\\\nthat we do need to keep thinking about.\\\\n    Mr. Davidson. Okay. Thank you. My time has expired, and I \\\\nyield back.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \\\\nNevada, Mr. Horsford, is recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank \\\\nyou to the ranking member for this hearing, and thank you, \\\\nDirector Chopra, for returning to discuss the continued \\\\nconsumer protection efforts that your Bureau has undertaken \\\\nsince we last spoke. Americans everywhere deserve to have \\\\nsomeone in their corner every day to keep a watchful eye on the \\\\nfinancial sector and to protect hardworking people from \\\\ndiscrimination and fraud.\\\\n    I was pleased to receive your report. In it, you identified \\\\n950,000 complaints that were received in the time period \\\\nencompassed by the report, with an impressive 99-percent \\\\nresponse rate from the respective companies. The CFPB is not \\\\njust standing idly by, but is actively securing redress for \\\\nharmed consumers. Under your leadership, I have been glad to \\\\nsee the CFPB standing up for consumers, combating the negative \\\\neffects of medical debt, ensuring that fair lending standards \\\\nare adhered to, and holding bad actors in our financial sector \\\\naccountable.\\\\n    I want to point to the issue of the Office of Servicemember \\\\nAffairs and how they are working to address the growing number \\\\nof complaints that members of our Armed Forces have regarding \\\\ntheir consumer protection needs. As you are aware, in June your \\\\nagency reported that there was a staggering 66,400 complaints \\\\nfiled by servicemembers in 2022 alone. This is a dramatic 55-\\\\npercent increase from the prior year. Unfortunately, for my \\\\nhome State of Nevada, the volume of complaints from \\\\nservicemembers ranks third in the country on a per capita \\\\nbasis.\\\\n    Director Chopra, your report on Servicemember Affairs shows \\\\nthat active-duty personnel are 76 percent more likely to become \\\\nvictims of identity theft than the general population. What are \\\\nyour insights into why this may be the cause, what \\\\ncharacteristics make them most susceptible to theft, and what \\\\nrecommendations do you have to further protect them from this \\\\nabuse?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We have seen time and time again, active-duty \\\\nservicemembers&#x27; personal data being weaponized. It used to just \\\\ntake the form of putting a fake debt on their credit report and \\\\nbullying them into paying something they didn&#x27;t owe. Now, it is \\\\ngetting even more sophisticated. We see that all sorts of data \\\\ncompanies are collecting information on military personnel. \\\\nIdentity theft is just one piece. There are real national \\\\nsecurity implications. We don&#x27;t just care about these families \\\\nbecause they serve our country. They are often the canary in \\\\nthe coal mine for everyone else, and that is why we pay a lot \\\\nof attention to it.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. I am glad you are. As you said, it does take \\\\nattention away from national security. It has serious negative \\\\neffects on morale and can even interrupt their service if it is \\\\nnot addressed, so I look forward to working with you on that \\\\nissue. Private identity verification companies are fortunately \\\\nable to prevent some of these issues, so I am glad that while \\\\nthe CFPB has enhanced capabilities to protect these \\\\npopulations, fraudulent applications and identity theft can be \\\\ndisastrous for any American.\\\\n    As we look to continue to expand access to credit across \\\\nthe country, have you considered that these unintended \\\\nconsequences of your upcoming Fair Credit Reporting Act \\\\nrulemaking could lead to more legitimate applicants being \\\\ninappropriately rejected due to their perceived fraud risk by \\\\nfinancial institutions?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We haven&#x27;t proposed anything as of yet, \\\\nbut we are trying to look at all the ways that data could be \\\\nused or misused and, ultimately, look at the downstream \\\\neffects. Absolutely, we are looking at all aspects before we \\\\npropose anything.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Thank you. Dr. Chopra, I have also been \\\\npleased to see that the CFPB has brought about enforcement \\\\nactions to curtail the unscrupulous actors in the credit repair \\\\nmarketplace. Unfortunately, in an industry rife with \\\\nmalpractice, there are still bad actors operating in blatant \\\\nviolation of your recent court ruling regarding deceptive \\\\ntelemarketing practices. The Bureau should apply this decision \\\\nuniformly across the credit repair space to protect our most-\\\\nvulnerable consumers from being scammed by products that will \\\\nactually do little to improve their credit. Do you believe that \\\\nthere is a benefit to providing clear, consistent guidance \\\\nregarding the telemarketing sales rule&#x27;s advanced fee \\\\nprohibition in order to prevent bad actors from continuing to \\\\ntake advantage of consumers?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, and the telemarketing sales rule, while we \\\\nenforce it, it is not administered by the CFPB. The Federal \\\\nTrade Commission (FTC) is the one that issues rules and \\\\nguidance, but I think certainly as these scams develop, we can \\\\nhave a conversation with them about that.\\\\n    Mr. Horsford. Thank you very much. I look forward to \\\\ncontinuing to work with you. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \\\\nMichigan, Mr. Huizenga, is now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize for \\\\nmy tardiness. I was in the Budget Committee testifying on our \\\\ndebt commission that, I think, is also another significant \\\\nissue for us. But thank you, Director Chopra, for being here \\\\ntoday. I have a couple of topics I want to cover this morning, \\\\nso I ask for concise answers.\\\\n    You have been employed by the U.S. Government for about a \\\\ndecade. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, all told.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. And holding several senior positions \\\\nthroughout that time?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Yes. Okay. You have served on the FDIC&#x27;s \\\\nBoard of Directors since October of 2021, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Since you have been a Director on the FDIC \\\\nBoard, were you ever made aware of the July 2020 FDIC Office of \\\\nInspector General report on the sexual harassment charges that \\\\nwere happening at the FDIC?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I can&#x27;t recall when, but I did review, prior to \\\\ncoming to the Board, all ofthose reports that the Inspector \\\\nGeneral and others had issued on a wide range----\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Had the Inspector General run you through \\\\nthose and the Board? Who made you aware of those?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Prior to being confirmed, I personally reviewed \\\\nall of those for the CFPB and others as well to prepare. I do \\\\nhave periodic discussions with the Inspector General about \\\\nthat. And with respect to implementing any recommendations, the \\\\nexecutives of the Corporation do file periodic reports about \\\\nwhere things are. So, we try our best to ascertain where the \\\\nissues are.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Are you alarmed by the FDIC OIG&#x27;s findings of \\\\nunderreporting and fear of retaliation at the FDIC?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, and, in fact, at the CFPB, we actually \\\\nimplemented a number of new steps to make sure that there were \\\\nmany ways for employees to report these issues. From a risk \\\\nmanagement perspective, you want to be able to be sure you are \\\\ngetting these complaints, and every agency is trying to do----\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Well, maybe not every agency is trying \\\\nto do that.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Well, I can speak for the CFPB.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Okay. So, you are speaking for yourself, and \\\\nyou are saying--I am not trying to put words in your mouth--you \\\\nare saying you took your experiences and what you witnessed at \\\\nthe FDIC, and you are trying to improve the CFPB&#x27;s operations, \\\\ncorrect?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Sure, and other agencies.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Now, I have been, and I think a number \\\\nof my colleagues have been a bit critical of your role in \\\\nousting the last Chair of the FDIC and sort of what happened \\\\nthere. Why weren&#x27;t you as concerned or as aggressive with this \\\\nparticular Chair?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. To be clear, the last Chair resigned. There was \\\\nan issue about the law----\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. There was significant palace intrigue behind \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. There was a violation of the law, in my view \\\\nand others, but I know you don&#x27;t want to get----\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. Okay, a violation of the law. We have some \\\\nvery, very serious charges with people at the FDIC, including \\\\nthis Chair, and whether he knew and whether he was involved or \\\\nhow he was involved, so why not take that same passion to the \\\\nFDIC?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly, any type of these issues are \\\\nserious. The Board has created a bipartisan special committee \\\\nthat will have full authority to investigate it, to hire \\\\noutside players, to determine if appropriate actions were \\\\ntaken, and to identify what needs to change.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. I am going to remind some of my newer \\\\ncolleagues that it wasn&#x27;t that long ago we had another head of \\\\nan agency--the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)--Mel Watt, \\\\nour former colleague on this committee, who was before the \\\\ncommittee to discuss allegations of inappropriate behavior, and \\\\nit was a bipartisan effort then. I hope the discussion of the \\\\nFDIC is a bipartisan effort now. As Chair of our Oversight and \\\\nInvestigations Subcommittee, I hold our government officials \\\\naccountable, and I hope and expect that the FDIC Chair and \\\\nothers are going to cooperate fully.\\\\n    Let me turn very briefly here to a recent enforcement \\\\naction of yours--Mr. Barr had brought this up earlier--about \\\\nthe CFPB using the fine print, pop-ups, dropdowns, different \\\\nsort of criteria, as labeling that abusive. Now, in this \\\\ninstance, the company in question was following the laws of the \\\\nState in which they were operating. And while your agency did \\\\nnot accuse the finance company of breaking any laws, you still \\\\nwent forward with an enforcement action. Last night, I sent you \\\\na letter on this specific issue.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. That is not true. We did plead a violation of \\\\nlaw in the complaints. Every enforcement action, if it is being \\\\nlitigated, has specific allegations of what law is being \\\\nviolated, and that will be adjudicated.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. My time has expired, but last night, I sent \\\\nyou a letter on this specific issue, and I expect a------\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We will respond.\\\\n    Mr. Huizenga. ----response in a timely manner. Thank you. \\\\nMr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Barr. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired and I thank him \\\\nfor his good work as our Oversight Subcommittee Chair. The \\\\ngentlewoman from Michigan, Ms. Talib, is now recognized.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you \\\\nso much, Director Chopra. I want to talk about something that \\\\nmy residents are actually asking me about specifically. Of \\\\ncourse, the CFPB has been incredibly responsive with a number \\\\nof fraudulent cases, issues that are coming up with folks&#x27; \\\\ncredit card companies, so I appreciate your team and your staff \\\\nbeing so responsive to my team. They really are getting \\\\ncallbacks and feeling like they have an advocate in the CFPB.\\\\n    As you know, nearly 1 in 5 American adults are burdened \\\\nwith medical debt, and this is something that I have been \\\\ncontinuing to talk about with many of my colleagues here. I \\\\nfeel like it is completely wrong to have medical debt weighing \\\\ndown credit reports. And you and I know no one chooses to get \\\\nsick, and I know you have personal stories yourself, but \\\\nmedical debt should not prevent somebody from securing a home \\\\nor even education, basic needs. I have even had residents talk \\\\nto me about the fact that they had to sell their home because \\\\nof medical debt or get another loan on their home because of \\\\nmedical debt.\\\\n    In my own district, we have had residents who are veterans \\\\nor seniors report difficulty in paying $3,000 to $4,000 in \\\\nmedical bills, and they are on a fixed income. And these are \\\\nfolks, by the way, who get their stuff garnished, they go after \\\\nthem, and these are people who are actually insured. Let&#x27;s \\\\nunderstand that. They are not uninsured. They are actually \\\\nfolks with health insurance, who are still facing a high burden \\\\nof medical debt. And for me, I was so incredibly excited that \\\\nthe CFPB announced a rulemaking process to remove medical debt \\\\nfrom consumer credit reports, which I also called for in my \\\\nRestoring Unfairly Impaired Credit and Protecting Consumers \\\\nAct.\\\\n    Director Chopra, can you describe, because I think it is \\\\nimportant for my colleagues to listen to this--this is \\\\nimportant, because even Chairman McHenry talked about the fact \\\\nthat he paid his bill, and it still showed up, and the \\\\ninaccuracy of debt that is showing up on people&#x27;s credit \\\\nreports. Collections are inaccurate. Things are already paid. A \\\\nmedical service that occurred many, many years ago is all of a \\\\nsudden appearing from decades prior on people&#x27;s credit. It is \\\\nreally unbelievable the stories that are coming from many \\\\nfolks. Can you describe some of the billing and collection \\\\npractices that motivated the CFPB to take action?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. What we saw is that the largest delinquent, \\\\nderogatory items on a credit report were no longer credit \\\\ncards, and no longer a normal loan. It was allegedly unpaid \\\\nbills, and the very common experience was people say, I am \\\\ndisputing this, this is wrong, and then, they go through this \\\\nendless paperwork process to do it, and we know this is not \\\\nlike a normal loan. This is a situation where there is a back \\\\nand forth between the insurance company, the provider, and the \\\\nfacility, and we have found very serious inaccuracies. And I \\\\nthink it has just raised the question about, given its limited \\\\nor almost no predictive value in cases, is the credit report \\\\njust a way to coerce someone to pay something they don&#x27;t owe?\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Exactly. And I think you led a little bit on \\\\nthis, but your own research at the CFPB found that using \\\\nmedical billing data on a credit report is less predictive of a \\\\ncredit risk or performance than non-medical collection. So, \\\\nthere is no benefit in having medical debt on credit reports \\\\nand weighing down on so many of our families, from cancer to \\\\neven folks who have really awful car accidents that lead to so \\\\nmany charges, including physical therapy. Folks have told me \\\\nthat they have insurance, but it didn&#x27;t cover everything, and \\\\nyears later, they are getting all this stuff showing up on \\\\ntheir credit report.\\\\n    There is something that I talked to you about, and I really \\\\nwant to take a moment, and I know you may not have coverage \\\\nover, but right now, auto insurance companies are using non-\\\\ndriving factors, Director, and I talked to Treasury Secretary \\\\nYellen about that this this morning. It really has had a \\\\ndisparate impact on my residents, using marital status and \\\\neducation level for credit scores. I just feel like that \\\\npractice is a way to discriminate, especially when I see folks \\\\nwith DUIs but high credit scores paying 3 times less than \\\\nsomebody with no DUI and a lower credit score. And I wanted to \\\\nsee if you had anything to say about that?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. You are right, we don&#x27;t regulate \\\\ninsurance, but I think there are serious issues with how credit \\\\nscores are being used sometimes. For many people, it just \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t seem to make sense.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. No. Somebody with a Ph.D. is not necessarily \\\\ngoing to be a better driver. I don&#x27;t understand the rationale \\\\nthat auto insurance companies use in this data.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think sometimes, they will say it reflects on \\\\nwhether their premium is going to get paid, but sometimes, it \\\\nis so variant, and, again, we don&#x27;t have authority over here. \\\\nWe just cover the credit report and credit score, but \\\\ncertainly, if Treasury&#x27;s insurance office does further work on \\\\nthis, we are happy to provide information on the State \\\\ninsurance regulators. I know many of them are also wondering \\\\nthe same thing.\\\\n    Ms. Tlaib. Yes. Some States have done that, but thank you \\\\nso much. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. [presiding]. The gentlelady yields back, \\\\nand we will take a 5-minute recess.\\\\n    [recess]\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Okay. We are back, and next, we are going \\\\nto go to the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Rose, for 5 \\\\nminutes..\\\\n    Mr. Rose. I want to thank Chairman McHenry, and thank you, \\\\ntoo, Director Chopra for being here today.\\\\n    Director Chopra, last month, The New York Times ran an \\\\narticle with a headline calling you, ``Wall Street&#x27;s Most Hated \\\\nRegulator,&#x27;&#x27; and stated that bankers believe that you are a \\\\nregulator gone rogue. Do you agree with the characterization \\\\nthat you are Wall Street&#x27;s most hated regulator and a regulator \\\\ngone rogue?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly not, but you will have to ask them. \\\\nWe try and make sure that all of our work is really with the \\\\npublic interest in mind, including honest financial \\\\ninstitutions.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you for that. I want to say this to you, \\\\nbecause I feel this very strongly about all of our Federal \\\\nregulators, that in my view, your first responsibility is to \\\\nhelp those who you regulate comply with the regulations, and \\\\nthat your entire approach to that regulated community that you \\\\ndeal with should be to empower, enable, inform, educate, and \\\\nfacilitate their compliance with the regulations that are \\\\nintended to protect the consumers of this country. Do you agree \\\\nwith that observation?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, and, in fact, we spend much more of our \\\\nenergy on supervision, and most of the issues are not dealt \\\\nwith in litigation or enforcement actions. In many cases, they \\\\nare when they are serious or repeat offenses, but we do take \\\\nthat as examiners looking at where there are issues and being \\\\nconstructive about how it can be fixed.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. I worry then a little bit. I know earlier in your \\\\nremarks, you highlighted the amount of fines that you have \\\\nrecovered from the regulated community, and I just----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Restitution.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. ----would caution you that I don&#x27;t think that is \\\\nthe objective. I don&#x27;t think that is what we ought to be \\\\nmeasuring your success by. I think compliance with a regulated \\\\ncommunity that understands what they are supposed to be doing \\\\nto protect consumers is the goal, and what I would like to hear \\\\nis measures that affirm the agency&#x27;s understanding, the \\\\nBureau&#x27;s understanding.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. And just to comment on that, we have really \\\\nfocused on repeat offenders and others. We are not trying to \\\\ntarget with, ``gotcha,&#x27;&#x27; actions. I saw that at the Federal \\\\nTrade Commission, where that agency had a history of targeting \\\\nsmall businesses, strong-arming them into settlements. We just \\\\nare taking a very different approach.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you. Director Chopra, as has already come \\\\nup today, and I am sure you are aware, of course, of the FDIC \\\\nInspector General starting an investigation into the extremely \\\\nserious workplace misconduct allegations first raised by The \\\\nWall Street Journal. As a Board member of the FDIC, will you \\\\ncommit to fully cooperating with any requests made by the FDIC \\\\nInspector General regarding their investigation?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Oh, of course, and, in fact, we cooperate with \\\\nall sorts of inquiries on this.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you. And will you commit to fully \\\\ncooperating with congressional investigations into workplace \\\\nmisconduct allegations at the FDIC, including promptly turning \\\\nover any requested information and documents?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. As always, we will work with you to accommodate \\\\nyour request. Obviously, it is another agency we have, the \\\\nCFPB, but you are right, I am a Board member, so we will do our \\\\nbest to accommodate that.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you. Director Chopra, have you ever been \\\\ninvestigated for workplace misconduct?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I have never been a target of an investigation. \\\\nOf course, where there have been issues, there are lots of \\\\nother investigations. We always cooperate, but I have never \\\\nbeen a target of one.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Do you believe that consumers should have the \\\\nfinancial freedom to make their own financial choices as long \\\\nas loan terms are clearly disclosed?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I think that is right. I think we want \\\\nconsumers to have lots of choice and to be able to compare one \\\\nwith the other. I think in the digital economy, there are new \\\\nissues about how they can present certain information, so-\\\\ncalled dark patterns, but yes, we want to give consumers that \\\\ninformed choice.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you. And as our time winds down here, would \\\\nyou help to explain how you and the Bureau are ensuring that \\\\nthe costs of regulations and other CFPB actions do not outweigh \\\\nany potential benefit, especially since those costs, of course, \\\\nwill likely be passed on, ultimately, to the consumer?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We never want to do something that makes \\\\nthe public worse off. I think your colleague asked me a \\\\nquestion about when there are benefits--Congress had passed the \\\\nDebt Bondage Repair Act, which the CFPB implemented. That is \\\\nabout a human trafficking survivor getting their life back. It \\\\nis sometimes hard to put a dollar figure on it, but we do our \\\\nbest in the required analyses in those rules.\\\\n    Mr. Rose. Thank you very much, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now go to the \\\\ngentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Nickel, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thank you very much. I want to thank Chairman \\\\nMcHenry and Ranking Member Waters for their work on these \\\\nissues. And it is great to see you, Director Chopra. My \\\\ncolleague from Tennessee referenced the article where you are \\\\nthe most-hated regulator on Wall Street. I was just on Wall \\\\nStreet yesterday, and I definitely don&#x27;t think you are the most \\\\nhated. I can feel pretty confident about that. I don&#x27;t know if \\\\nthat is much of a consolation prize, but----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It is not a popularity contest, so yes.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Yes. And 25 of these, when you get down to the \\\\nfinal row here of Democrats, it has been a while, so thank you \\\\nfor your testimony and being here. I want to thank you for the \\\\nwork you and your colleagues at the Bureau do daily to protect \\\\nconsumers, Democrat or Republican. All of our constituents rely \\\\non the CFPB to protect them from financial harm. In fact, over \\\\n82 percent of Americans want the Bureau to continue doing its \\\\njob. I think that is a good record of success. And earlier, I \\\\nheard from some of my Republican colleagues, and I was glad to \\\\nhear them voicing words of encouragement and support for open \\\\nbanking. I want to talk a little bit about open banking.\\\\n    I am glad the CFPB proposed the Personal Financial Data \\\\nRights Rule last month to accelerate the shift towards open \\\\nbanking. Open banking would give consumers the right to control \\\\ntheir financial data, which is long overdue. As an example, if \\\\none of my constituents has a checking account at a bank but is \\\\nreceiving bad service, high fees, under the current system, \\\\nthey would have to jump through a significant amount of hoops \\\\nto, ``break up,&#x27;&#x27; with that bank and move their data to another \\\\nfinancial services company, whether it is a bank or a fintech. \\\\nThey would likely lose some of their data along the way, and \\\\nspend countless hours trying to piece it all together as they \\\\nmake that shift. But open banking will change this, make life \\\\neasier for consumers, drive down costs, and promote financial \\\\ninclusion. Can you share your thoughts on how open banking is \\\\ntransforming the financial landscape for consumers in the U.S.?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I think the more we can give people the \\\\nability not to just solely be judged by a three-digit score but \\\\nalso their financial history, being able to give that data, to \\\\nbe able to get a better term, to avoid illegal conduct, to \\\\nreally have more of a driver&#x27;s seat, I think this is really a \\\\nway to make banking a way to give consumers a wider range of \\\\noptions. And I think smaller entities are really going to be \\\\nable to compete more easily with the big players this way. \\\\nRather than being locked in with one provider, local \\\\ninstitutions or startups will have more of a chance to win on \\\\nthe merits.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Yes. Under this proposed rule, the CFPB would \\\\nrely on a separate standard-setting organization to establish \\\\nthe technical standards and certifications for consumer \\\\npermission sharing. Given that this organization would be a \\\\nseparate entity from the CFPB and not subject to its oversight, \\\\nhow would you ensure that all parties have a seat at the table \\\\nand that this arrangement doesn&#x27;t result in anticompetitive \\\\nbehavior, while also meeting its standard-setting obligations \\\\nin a timely manner?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It is a huge concern to make sure that there \\\\nare not a small set of actors who get to dictate, in an \\\\nanticompetitive way, so we would have oversight. Under our \\\\nproposed rule, the CFPB would have to recognize the standard-\\\\nsetting body, and pursuant to longstanding guidance, that body \\\\nwould need to be inclusive of all perspectives. It can&#x27;t just \\\\nbe the incumbents or it can&#x27;t just be the fintechs. It really \\\\nhas to have everybody. We are collecting comments on that now, \\\\nbut that is going to be a big piece in determining how open \\\\nbanking accelerates.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thanks so much. And in the remaining time, I \\\\nwant to just touch on credit repair scams. I have been working \\\\non legislation in a bipartisan way to finally stop credit \\\\nrepair scams, and I know we have talked about this in my \\\\noffice. I appreciate your work and your leadership here. These \\\\ncompanies market themselves to financially-distressed \\\\nconsumers, falsely promising to increase credit scores while \\\\ncharging exorbitant fees in monthly subscription services that \\\\ncan cost thousands of dollars but yield few positive results. \\\\nWhile the Bureau took enforcement action against one of the \\\\nlargest credit repair organizations earlier this year, are you \\\\nconcerned that these scams will continue by new organizations, \\\\nespecially as household debt increases?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I am also worried about how they might be \\\\ntargeted using very sensitive information about people, \\\\nparticularly on social media, but not exclusively. We are \\\\ntrying to look at how people can actually navigate ways to \\\\naddress their debt issues without ending up worse off in the \\\\nprocess.\\\\n    Mr. Nickel. Thanks so much, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now go to the \\\\ngentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Steil, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you \\\\nfor being here, Director Chopra. I think we are discussing \\\\nreally important topics.\\\\n    Let me go back to your opening statement, if I can, for \\\\njust a minute. In your opening statement, you noted that credit \\\\ncard debt is increasing now north of a trillion dollars. Auto \\\\nloans are increasing north of $1.6 trillion. Mortgages have \\\\nincreased dramatically. The median mortgage in the United \\\\nStates, over the course of 3 years, went from $1,200 to $2,400. \\\\nThat is significant. It is a major concern. The driver of that, \\\\nI think should be noted, is largely the inflationary policies \\\\nput in place by the Biden Administration, in particular, \\\\nreckless spending, the war on energy, and paying people not to \\\\nwork after the pandemic. And as we look at the drivers of \\\\nincreasing debt for Americans, I would encourage my colleagues \\\\non the left side of the aisle to join us to work to bring down \\\\ninflation. That is outside your wheelhouse, but I wanted to put \\\\nthat out there because I think it is a really important point \\\\nto your earlier points and your opening remarks.\\\\n    Let me jump into Earned Wage Access (EWA), which gives \\\\nindividuals access to wages that they earned. Improving the \\\\nconnection between pay and work in a more timely manner, I \\\\nthink is a great opportunity that is out there. You commented \\\\nin the press that the CFPB is re-examining the 2020 guidance \\\\nthat maintained that EWA was not a credit product. Can you give \\\\nme an update as to when you expect the review to be completed?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I am hoping we will be able to answer more of \\\\nthe questions that we have been getting in the next few months, \\\\nand, specifically, there has----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. So, you expect that in the next few months, that \\\\nrulemaking process will be concluded?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think we are going to try and provide \\\\nadditional guidance on it. The original guidance that was \\\\nprovided a few years ago covered a pretty narrow set of \\\\ncircumstances. It is essentially ones that were free, so earned \\\\nwage advance, earned wage access, some of it is with the \\\\nemployer, and some of it is separate from the employer----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. There is a significant development in the public \\\\nspace----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. There have been significant developments in the \\\\nlast few years.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. So, you are expecting that in the next few \\\\nmonths, you will be coming forward with that. As you are going \\\\nthrough that process, I would like you to make sure that we are \\\\nnot reducing consumer access in that space.\\\\n    Let me follow up on my colleague, Andy Barr&#x27;s, earlier \\\\ncomment as it related to nonsufficient funds and your review of \\\\nthat. I would echo his comment that I think it is important \\\\nthat these rules are enforced prospectively and not \\\\nretroactively in light of the previous guidance from the CFPB.\\\\n    I will jump to one more topic here, the proposed rule that \\\\nthe Bureau&#x27;s new supervisory powers, in particular, as it \\\\nrelates to digital apps in wallets. You noted in your remarks \\\\nthat consumer complaints is one justification of the proposed \\\\nrule, so if you could expand on how much complaints rose and \\\\nover what period of time?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I can&#x27;t recall. As part of that rule, we are \\\\nsupposed to look at risk using a multifactor analysis, and----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. No, I understand, but if you could get back to \\\\nme on the complaints, how they came back?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Is there a portal at the CFPB where someone \\\\ncould issue a complaint, or do you know how the CFPB would \\\\nreceive those complaints from individuals?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We receive them through our website, \\\\nthrough the phone, and other ways. We receive thousands each \\\\nweek.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Okay. And then, an analysis is taken into \\\\naccount on how many complaints are resolved?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly, we look at all of those factors, but \\\\nwith respect to that proposed rule, that is one issue, but \\\\nthere are many, many other reasons for the rationale for that \\\\nproposal. It really focuses on the consumer payment apps.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. No, I understand. In the proposed rule, it is \\\\nnoted that one of the justifications for this is a rise in \\\\nconsumer complaints. If there are consumer complaints, I would \\\\nlike to know.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. I think that is a valid thing that we should be \\\\nthinking about on this committee.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Totally.\\\\n    Mr. Steil. I am just looking for some clarity as to what \\\\nthe rise in consumer complaints is, and I understand you don&#x27;t \\\\nhave know off the top of your head. That is fine, but if you \\\\ncan get back to me in writing as to what that is in a numerical \\\\nanalysis, I would appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We will answer questions for the record, \\\\nand we will provide numbers of where we----\\\\n    Mr. Steil. Perfect. Let me do one final piece here. Last \\\\nyear, when you testified in front of the committee, I asked if \\\\nyour speeches, press releases, and blog posts are reviewed by \\\\nattorneys. You responded that it is sometimes the case. You \\\\nwere kind of open to the feedback that we had because I think \\\\nyour words have very serious implications for consumers and \\\\nmarkets.\\\\n    And I remain concerned that some statements that you have \\\\nmade are more in light of shaming businesses into doing what \\\\nthe agency wants rather than going through a traditional \\\\nrulemaking process. So, I would just continue to encourage you \\\\nto engage legal counsel in the review of your posts on blogs or \\\\nat other locations because I do think they have market-moving \\\\ninfluence. I am concerned that that is outside of the \\\\nfunctional rulemaking process, and I appreciate you being here. \\\\nMr. Chairman, I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now recognize \\\\nthe gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gonzalez, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, \\\\nDirector Chopra, for being here with us today.\\\\n    Let&#x27;s talk about medical debt. The State of Texas has the \\\\nhighest rate of uninsured working-age adults in the country, in \\\\npart due to the State Government and the Governor who refuses \\\\nto comply with Federal law to expand Medicaid. Most of my \\\\nconstituency is severely unbanked or underbanked and do not \\\\nhave the up-front capital to pay for healthcare costs, leaving \\\\nmany with medical debt. The ding on their credit report for \\\\nmedical debt, which is not an accurate measure, as you know, of \\\\ncredit risk, also means it is harder for them to access \\\\ntraditional sources for credit like bank loans and credit \\\\ncards. I was excited to learn of the proposal announced in \\\\nSeptember of this year by the CFPB that would address this \\\\nissue head on. If this goes into effect, could you outline the \\\\nsteps for the CFPB, the steps they would take to ensure that \\\\ncreditworthy consumers are not unduly prevented from attaining \\\\ncredit or even a job simply because of a debt they owe or a \\\\ndebt they owe from a loved one who has gotten sick?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think really \\\\nour lodestar on this has been the real challenges of accuracy, \\\\nand, again, I mentioned to your colleagues, it is not like a \\\\nnormal loan, and it is often a bill that is put on your credit \\\\nreport. You mentioned uninsured, but a lot of the issues are \\\\neven people with insurance. There are many parties. There is a \\\\nprovider. There is a facility. There is an insurance company. \\\\nThere is a patient. There is a debt collector. There is a \\\\ncredit reporting agency. And over many years, I think there is \\\\nbeen a consensus that there is extremely limited predictive \\\\nvalue of this. And given the inaccuracies, you worry a lot that \\\\npeople, when they are applying for a job or credit, are just \\\\npaying something that they don&#x27;t owe. The big credit reporting \\\\nconglomerates have taken some steps, but we are looking at \\\\nwhether we might propose a rule to address it more directly, \\\\nand we are currently collecting feedback from small entity \\\\nrepresentatives on that, and that will inform any proposed \\\\nrule.\\\\n    Mr. Gonzalez. I can&#x27;t agree with you more, and thank you \\\\nfor these steps you are taking. Also, as you know, in 2012 the \\\\nCFPB implemented its remittances rule requiring companies that \\\\noffer remittances to provide consistent disclosure regarding \\\\nthe price of a transfer before consumers make payments. While \\\\nthe remittances rule created essential protections for millions \\\\nof immigrants, servicemembers, students, and others who send \\\\nmoney to other countries, providers have found ways to get \\\\naround it. According to consumer and immigration groups, U.S. \\\\nconsumers lose approximately $8.7 billion a year due to hidden \\\\nfees, or they sometimes can change it under exchange rates and \\\\nrecover it in the other country.\\\\n    In June of 2023, you testified before this committee and \\\\nrecognized this issue. Like my colleague, Mr. Vargas, has \\\\nstated in the past--he calls them junk fees, which I agree \\\\nwith, and they have impacted our constituents who send \\\\nremittances to their families abroad. The money earned by these \\\\nhardworking people should not be lost to hidden fees or extra \\\\nfees but go to their families. So I ask, what is the CFPB doing \\\\nto protect consumers and ensure hidden fees aren&#x27;t being folded \\\\ninto exchange markup rates? Is there a plan in place to prevent \\\\nremittances providers from continuing this practice?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We have taken a number of actions against \\\\nproviders that have egregiously violated the law on this front, \\\\nbut I think there is this question of, how will a consumer be \\\\nable to get a competitively-priced remittance? They are paying \\\\nfor it, and when you are looking at multiple levers, the \\\\nexchange rate, sometimes, there is an advertisement where it \\\\nsays, ``free,&#x27;&#x27; and you know when it is really not free. That \\\\nis what we are really focused on. We are seeing if that is \\\\nworking or not. There are a lot of other places where people \\\\nmay have options on sending remittances that they may not even \\\\nbe aware of, so we are looking at all of that.\\\\n    Mr. Gonzalez. Yes. Certainly, things have improved since \\\\nthe 1990s, but the concern is whomever their partners are in \\\\nthe receiving country----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The other side.\\\\n    Mr. Gonzalez. Right. And I know for Mexico, for sure, they \\\\nget shortchanged on the exchange rate, and I think that is \\\\nhappening around the world. Thank you for the work you are \\\\ndoing, and we hope that you continue looking into this issue \\\\nthat impacts millions of people here and around the world.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman \\\\nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Timmons, is now recognized.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The CFPB has kicked \\\\noff a massive rulemaking to revise Regulation V, which \\\\nimplements the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The FCRA and \\\\nRegulation V set strict guidelines for the credit reporting \\\\nsystem, and these guidelines enable our credit economy to \\\\nfunction. Thus, changes to this foundation should not be made \\\\nlightly, nor should they be rushed.\\\\n    Accordingly, I have concerns with the FCRA SBREFA proposal \\\\nthat seeks to designate specific data breaches as FCRA \\\\nviolations. Numerous Federal and State laws already mandate \\\\ndata security measures and breach notifications to consumers. \\\\nNevertheless, the CFPB seems inclined to introduce a strict \\\\nliability standard concerning data breaches or unauthorized \\\\naccess to consumer data by third parties.\\\\n    But before I move on, the CFPB had its own data breach \\\\nimpacting a quarter million Americans. Would a strict liability \\\\nstandard be appropriate for the CFPB&#x27;s own data breach?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Just to be clear, we have not proposed a rule. \\\\nWe have been looking at multiple options on data brokers as \\\\nwell as how there may be access to data, but of course, the \\\\nsituation at the CFPB with an insider threat was very, very \\\\nserious. We did the consumer notifications and we erred on the \\\\nside of making sure it was clear. We talked to our supervised \\\\nentities. In some ways, there were automatic triggers that led \\\\nus----\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. How will they be made whole? How will the \\\\nvictims be made whole? If it was a private business or a bank, \\\\nthey would have to pay restitution. The CFPB has hundreds of \\\\nmillions of dollars. Is there any restitution that is going to \\\\nbe offered to these victims?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Fortunately, we have no indicia, and it is \\\\nreally based on the type of data that it could be used for any \\\\ntype of identity theft. It didn&#x27;t include----\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. Like filing unemployment claims fraudulently?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It didn&#x27;t include the type of information that \\\\ncould lead to that, but of course, I take your point. It was \\\\nvery serious, and we are taking steps to address it. And with \\\\nrespect to that outline, we are really trying to make sure we \\\\nare guarding privacy, and I agree with you that actually the \\\\ncredit reporting system is foundational, and we want to be \\\\njudicial.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. Do you know of any other example of data \\\\nsecurity and breach notification requirements that are enforced \\\\nwith a strict liability standard?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I do believe that some State laws do have that, \\\\nbut I can look it up and answer the question for the record.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. Okay. That would be great. I guess I am just \\\\nconcerned about what impact this standard would have on \\\\neconomic activity. Almost every corner of the financial \\\\nservices industry will tell you that their cybersecurity teams \\\\nspend more time and money on compliance than on actually \\\\nkeeping their data safe. I think the last thing we need is yet \\\\nanother redundant regulation taking resources away from these \\\\nentities providing actual cybersecurity.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. And we don&#x27;t want to do anything redundant, \\\\nthat is for sure.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. Thank you for that. Director Chopra, it has \\\\nbeen reported that the CFPB is readying a proposal focused on \\\\nbank overdraft fees, and apparently doing so just conveniently \\\\nright after your appearance on Capitol Hill this week. Is this \\\\nreport accurate, and what are you proposing in that rule?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We did put on our regulatory agenda many months \\\\nago that we would be looking at overdraft and NSF. We haven&#x27;t \\\\nmade any decisions on it, but one of the places that we got \\\\ninput on is people wanted some clarity on what the rules would \\\\nbe. There have been guidance documents. There are a number of \\\\nplaces. We are trying to sift through all that and ideally \\\\npropose something that makes sure that there are not overdraft \\\\nabuses.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. I guess overdraft is a service provided by \\\\nfinancial institutions for consumers to manage their finances. \\\\nI am curious, given your previous statements today about \\\\nattempting to foster competition in the banking sector, why do \\\\nyou think it is a good idea for government to set the price for \\\\na clearly-disclosed service offered to customers in the private \\\\nsector?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It is not about setting a price. I think there \\\\nhave been certain places where prices are a safe harbor to \\\\navoid some of the cost of compliance, but what we are looking \\\\nfor is for there to be a competitive market. When people are \\\\nborrowing, we want them to have lots of choices and to be able \\\\nto get it in a way that is the function of the market.\\\\n    Mr. Timmons. I guess that is just the free market. If they \\\\nwant to go to a different service provider to get a better \\\\nrate, they should. I am just worried that such a rule will \\\\nmerely result in denying overdraft protection for millions of \\\\nAmericans. These are the Americans who need it most, and if we \\\\nstart impacting the free market, I fear that they are not going \\\\nto be able to have access to overdraft protection, so the \\\\npeople who need it most, their transactions will ultimately be \\\\ndeclined. I appreciate the intent, but the outcome will be \\\\ndetrimental to those that you are seeking to protect. As you \\\\nconsider this issue, just appreciate that the banks are not \\\\ngoing to offer overdraft protection if they are not able to \\\\ncharge a fee for it.\\\\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now go to the \\\\ngentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Gottheimer, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Hello, Director \\\\nChopra. While I know that you don&#x27;t have direct oversight over \\\\ntolling, you do have oversight over our financial institutions, \\\\nparticularly with regard to revenue from exorbitant fees \\\\ncharged to consumers. It has come to my attention that some \\\\nfinancial institutions are providing favorable credit terms to \\\\nNew York&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the MTA, \\\\nbased on enormous and outrageous fees, including a new $23-a-\\\\nday congestion tax just to drive into New York City. That will \\\\nbe paid by hardworking families, particularly my constituents \\\\nin New Jersey, and you are a Jersey guy, so you know about \\\\nthese issues I am talking about.\\\\n    We are talking about charging nurses, cops and \\\\nfirefighters, labor, restaurant workers, and other hardworking \\\\nfamilies $23-a-day just to drive into New York City. You \\\\nunderstand consumer fairness perhaps better than anyone else in \\\\nthis room. Are you concerned at all that these banks will be \\\\nmaking money off of gouging middle-class Americans with \\\\nexorbitant tolls from their new congestion tax, and will you \\\\ncommit to investigating the revenue that financial institutions \\\\nare making from this congestion tax?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I actually have not heard this. I am from \\\\noutside Philadelphia, but my uncle worked for the New York MTA \\\\nfor a long time. But I will look into this and get back to you.\\\\n    Mr. Gottheimer. I would really appreciate if you would do \\\\nthat. I would be very grateful, and I will follow up with you.\\\\n    I am working with Representative Cartwright on legislation \\\\nthat would require the 6-percent interest rate cap for loans \\\\nmade to active-duty servicemembers to apply to all applicable \\\\naccounts held by the servicemember at a particular financial \\\\ninstitution. This is an issue I have been following closely, \\\\nand I know the CFPB released a credit card market report last \\\\nmonth which found that many credit card companies are not \\\\nproactively checking servicemembers&#x27; military status to ensure \\\\nthat they receive the benefits they have earned in return for \\\\ntheir sacrifices and service to our great nation. What needs to \\\\nbe done to make sure that more credit card companies are \\\\nproactively checking?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. This is a very good point, by the way. With \\\\nhigher interest rates, you actually have a lot more people, \\\\nincluding on their mortgage, where the Servicemembers Civil \\\\nRelief Act protection is going to kick in. We released some \\\\nanalysis about the low levels of take-up for National Guard and \\\\nreserve who were activated. Our Servicmember Affairs Office and \\\\nI put out some recommendations on what institutions can do to \\\\nmake sure that they are covering everyone. It is voluntary. We \\\\nknow some are doing it, but I do think there are some good \\\\nquestions about whether it should be required to simply make it \\\\ngo through the process rather than having the servicemember \\\\ndeal with every single notice through that process, and there \\\\nis a database. So, we can get back to you with some further \\\\ndetails on that, but it is a good, worthwhile idea.\\\\n    Mr. Gottheimer. Yes. I would really like to follow up with \\\\nyou on that as well. That would be great.\\\\n    And Director, this committee, as you might know, has \\\\nrecently discussed Earned Wage Access, known as EWA, products \\\\nwhich offer individuals the ability to draw money from their \\\\npaychecks before payday. Several States, such as Maryland and \\\\nConnecticut, have classified EWA products as credit products. \\\\nOther States, like Nevada and Missouri, do not recognize EWA \\\\nproviders as lenders. Director, does the CFPB view EWA as forms \\\\nof credit, and if so, does the Bureau plan to treat this \\\\nproduct on a level playing field with other credit products, \\\\nincluding by requiring the providers to disclose the cost of \\\\ncredit?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. Earned Wage Access (EWA) is often a \\\\nbranding term. It can be an earned wage. It is a cash advance. \\\\nSometimes, it is through the employer, and sometimes, it is \\\\nnot. The CFPB, a few years ago, did issue some guidance that \\\\nwas pretty narrow. It essentially involved free earned wage \\\\nadvance, so we know the market has developed a lot. Of course, \\\\nFederal law still applies. There is Federal and State law. We \\\\nlive with federalism. We are looking, as I mentioned to your \\\\ncolleague, at updating the guidance, given all the evolution in \\\\nthe marketplace.\\\\n    Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you so much. It is critical we \\\\nclassify, in my opinion, and govern these products \\\\nappropriately.\\\\n    I would like to shift gears quickly to open banking. One of \\\\nthe most prominent consumer protections is protecting consumers \\\\nfrom fraud, as you would agree, and as you know, fraudsters&#x27; \\\\npractices are evolving constantly, and the industry needs to be \\\\nable to continue to innovate to be more effective in curbing \\\\nbad actors. I am concerned that the open banking rule as \\\\nwritten will hinder critical industry efforts to fight fraud by \\\\nprohibiting the use of consumer data to develop or improve \\\\nfraud identification products. Can you please clarify how the \\\\nproposal permits the development and improvement of antifraud \\\\ntools?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think what you are referring to is there are \\\\nlimitations on secondary uses of the data, in other words, that \\\\nit is really to prevent fraud. We don&#x27;t want someone baiting a \\\\nconsumer to hand over their data, and say, I am going to give \\\\nyou an auto loan, when in reality, they are using it for all \\\\nsorts of other purposes. Really, the goal is to protect the \\\\nconsumer, to reduce bad actors. I think there are some \\\\nquestions in the notice of proposed rulemaking about how data \\\\ncan be used. We are collecting comments on that, but of course, \\\\nwe do want to make sure that fraud is reduced. Congressman \\\\nFoster raised the issue of identity verification. There is \\\\nreally a lot to work on, on this front. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize \\\\nthe gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Norman, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. Thank you, Director Chopra, for testifying \\\\ntoday. I am going to move through a couple of questions, and \\\\nfor any we can&#x27;t get through, we will write a letter, and if \\\\nyou could just get back to us.\\\\n    One question that has come up has been the funding for the \\\\nCFPB before the Supreme Court. You mentioned that you all have \\\\nundertaken a pretty extensive review of expenses, trying to cut \\\\nthe costs, I guess, of the CFPB. Has that been successful?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Just to make sure it is clear, we are always \\\\nlooking at ways to sunset old contracts that are no longer in \\\\nuse, and reduce waste. We try our best to constantly be doing \\\\nthat and to find more ways to get value out of every dollar \\\\nwith our procurement, and I have seen places where we are \\\\nmaking inroads on it. At the same time, we have to execute our \\\\nmission, and that requires expenditure.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. When you look at what the history is, I think \\\\nwhat the CFPB has done is, they can issue a 1-page letter to \\\\nthe Federal Reserve and fund up to 12 percent of the Federal \\\\nReserve&#x27;s expenses. In 2021, it was $717 million for Fiscal \\\\nYear 2021, and then, in 2022, it was $734 million. Has 2023 \\\\nseen an increase from the $734 million?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, I believe so, and, in fact, we have to \\\\nconsider a number of factors, and, of course, a big driver is \\\\nwages and compensation. That is our biggest piece.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. But it&#x27;s fair to say it has gone up?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Oh yes, it has gone up. I don&#x27;t think the \\\\nprojections are out of line with other banking regulators. I \\\\nthink, in some cases, it is lower.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. I think it was brought up about how we voted on \\\\ndoing away with the CFPB. I was one of 148 to vote to do away \\\\nwith it because of funding. Congress ought to have some type of \\\\noversight, and that a governmental agency can just submit a 1-\\\\npage letter and get funded, I think is unfair to the taxpayers.\\\\n    In a sweeping change of topics, I think the CFPB has \\\\nremoved or is in favor of removing all medical debt from credit \\\\nreports. Is that right?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No. We haven&#x27;t proposed it yet, but we are \\\\ncollecting feedback from small entity representatives on that. \\\\nAnd I think, again, it is interesting because it is not like \\\\nanother loan, and the inaccuracies and dispute rates on them \\\\nare extremely high compared to other products, and we also see \\\\nthat FICO, and others----\\\\n    Mr. Norman. You wouldn&#x27;t be in favor of taking it off the--\\\\n--\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Oh, we haven&#x27;t proposed it yet, but that is one \\\\nserious consideration that we are collecting comments on.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. What is your opinion of it, briefly, because I \\\\nwant to get to another one.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Based on the data over the past 10 years, I do \\\\nthink that the harms associated with inaccurate medical debt \\\\nreporting cause a nightmare for people----\\\\n    Mr. Norman. So, you would take it off?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. ----relative to the benefits. I kind of want to \\\\nsee how it all works.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The difference is, medical debt, we think of \\\\nseparately from the medical bills that you don&#x27;t apply for in \\\\nadvance as opposed to the medical loans and----\\\\n    Mr. Norman. I get it. Let me ask you this. You have a Small \\\\nBusiness Review Panel. Whom have you dealt with, or, I guess, \\\\nwhom have you gotten opinions from? Has it been from medical \\\\nproviders? Have you interviewed them?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. In terms of the panel, we will need to get \\\\nyou more information on who is on it, but I have personally \\\\ntalked to a number of medical professionals, including medical \\\\ndebt collectors who are inside the hospitals, inside the----\\\\n    Mr. Norman. You have met with them to get their opinion of \\\\nthis?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, and I think----\\\\n    Mr. Norman. And I will get a letter if you could just \\\\nrespond who you have gotten with.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. And we can even share with you some conferences \\\\nwhere we have given presentations. What is interesting is many \\\\nof the hospitals actually don&#x27;t send it to credit reporting, so \\\\nthere is a lot of heterogeneity in the practices.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. Okay. I am out of time.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Okay. Sorry.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. If you get can the information to us.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. Now, on Regulation F, where consumers can \\\\nconsent to receive accounts receivable via text, you have \\\\ncertain companies that are blacklisting, that are not sending \\\\ntexts, even though the consumer wants them to, like in \\\\nOperation Choke Point. Do you think this is right?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Wait. Say that again, some----\\\\n    Mr. Norman. If a consumer asks for the accounts receivable \\\\nto be received, the information on it via text, some companies \\\\njust are not doing that.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Let us know about it. I will say the regulation \\\\ndoesn&#x27;t require that debt collectors provide information by \\\\ntext. It just allows them if that is a choice, but we are happy \\\\nto follow up with you on it.\\\\n    Mr. Norman. Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. We now go \\\\nto the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Lynch.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Director \\\\nChopra. It&#x27;s good to see you again. Thank you for all your good \\\\nwork.\\\\n    I wanted to ask you about the proposed rulemaking that was \\\\nannounced in November. We have a bunch of these larger fintech \\\\nfirms that are using digital wallets, and in a way, they are \\\\nsort of blurring the line between regular commerce and banking. \\\\nI know that the original announcement was that you were going \\\\nto look at some of these larger firms and require them, because \\\\nthey are in a good part of the banking business, to report, as \\\\nwe require small banks and credit unions. I wanted to just get \\\\nsome of your thinking behind that on how big does a fintech \\\\nfirm need to be before they would come under this reporting, \\\\nwhich I think is appropriate for some of these larger and \\\\nbusier firms?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It is interesting. You have a lot of nonbanks, \\\\nparticularly with apps, that are transmitting, I think it is \\\\nnow trillions of dollars globally. In many ways, they look a \\\\nlot like what we see emerging in China where large tech firms \\\\nhave a lot of ability to collect data, and move payments.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We have proposed bringing in some of those \\\\nfirms and subjecting them to supervision. We already have \\\\nenforcement authority over them.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Right.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We think the supervision actually makes sure \\\\nthere is a level playing field between the banks that are doing \\\\nit and the nonbanks. There are a number of issues--fraud, \\\\nprivacy--but I think there is going to be a lot of value in \\\\nthat. We are collecting comments on the specific threshold, but \\\\nwe estimate it is about 1 or 2 dozen that could come under.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. I was reading that one of your enforcement cases \\\\nrecently was Inova. Was that the name of it?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, Inova.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. They actually went in and took money out of \\\\ntheir customers&#x27; accounts.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. Can I just share, Congressman?\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Yes, please.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We have a lot of situations where people are \\\\nable to get information about a customer, and then they can \\\\njust grab the money. There are lots of issues that impacts. So, \\\\nmaking sure that our payment system has a lot of fidelity is so \\\\nimportant to the lowest-income people in our country because a \\\\nwrongful debit in their account can send them into a tailspin.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Right, and there are credit rating issues there \\\\nbased on much of that difficulty. I know one of my colleagues \\\\nraised an issue earlier today about, I think it was Citibank, \\\\nand there was a discrimination issue there with Armenian-\\\\nsounding names, I guess.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It was actually names, particularly, that ended \\\\nin Y-A-N and I-A-N.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. I have a big Armenian population in my district, \\\\nso I am quite familiar with that.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. And those are obviously going to impact the \\\\nArmenian community.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Where does that come from? Do you have any sense \\\\nof----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. As we have investigated in the enforcement \\\\naction, they actually filed false reports to those borrowers as \\\\nto why they were declined, and they ostensibly said it was to \\\\ndetect and prevent fraud. But we allege, and I think provided \\\\nvery strong evidence that it was prohibited national origin \\\\ndiscrimination. We have laws on the books that don&#x27;t allow it \\\\nto say, ``you type of people.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. These are Armenian Americans, though, aren&#x27;t \\\\nthey?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Yes, in this country. I was just curious what \\\\nthe underpinnings of what the motivation might have been there, \\\\nif anything, during your investigation.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We can share more, but they were excluding \\\\npeople from the Glendale, California, area, which has a very \\\\nhigh concentration of Armenian Americans, as well as people \\\\nwith that last name suffix.\\\\n    Mr. Lynch. Okay. Maybe, we can talk offline about that. I \\\\ndo appreciate your good work, however, and how readily \\\\navailable you have been to members of this committee. I think \\\\nit is commendable the way you have handled your \\\\nresponsibilities. Thank you, and I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now go to the \\\\ngentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, \\\\nDirector Chopra. It&#x27;s good seeing you, and I, too, believe that \\\\nyour work is focused on improving situations, but I can&#x27;t help \\\\nbut have a number of questions, and maybe you can help clear \\\\nsome things up for me.\\\\n    Your mission at the CFPB, part of it anyway, is to aim to \\\\nmake consumer financial markets work for consumers, and \\\\nresponsible providers, so both, and the economy as a whole, to \\\\nprotect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices \\\\nand take action against companies that break the law. However, \\\\nthere are many in the banking and business communities that \\\\nthink that the CFPB is guilty of practices that are unfair and \\\\nperhaps abusive and that there is tremendous overreach, and \\\\nthat very often, rather than the bright-line concept, there is \\\\nideology over specific rules. And this isn&#x27;t just from one set \\\\nof resources. It is from large banks, small banks, super large \\\\nbanks, super regionals, $1 billion banks, $10 billion banks.\\\\n    I put out a text a little while ago to a few banks saying, \\\\n``Hey, give me some of your thoughts on the CFPB.&#x27;&#x27; And my \\\\nphone is blowing up with negative comments, for instance, \\\\n``1071, it will impose significant costs on banks, costs that \\\\nwill be felt most acutely by small community banks that will \\\\nnegatively affect their small business customers.&#x27;&#x27; This was \\\\nfrom a group.\\\\n    From another group, ``The proposed rule&#x27;s scope is \\\\nunnecessarily far-reaching. It would exempt very few community \\\\nbanks, define small businesses so broadly as to include tens of \\\\nthousands of large businesses, and require institutions to \\\\ncollect and report data on numerous data points, in addition to \\\\nthe congressionally-required data points.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Next one: ``The CFPB 1071 rule would create onerous \\\\nreporting requirements for both small business owners and \\\\nfinancial institutions.&#x27;&#x27; Here is one as well: ``The biggest \\\\nissue with the CFPB--and I know this person personally, a small \\\\nbank, with probably a billion dollars--is the regulations \\\\nrestrict banks from residential lending, limiting options for \\\\nborrowers, and forcing community banks to lend to more \\\\ncommercial customers.&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    I will leave it to you. How is this working? Everybody, \\\\nwhat a great job is being done. Okay. I would love to see a \\\\ngreat job being done. I want consumers to be protected. I don&#x27;t \\\\nwant bad characters to be able to play out, and that should be \\\\na good thing. But the fulfillment of all of this needs to have \\\\na feel that there is some sort of synergy or at least \\\\nimprovement in line with what is best for the economy as a \\\\nwhole. That is a somewhat general question, Director, but I \\\\nwill ask you to comment on some of those comments I read.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It is true that when regulators are doing their \\\\njob, we won&#x27;t always be the most popular when it comes to those \\\\nwhom we enforce the laws for, when it comes to detecting where \\\\nthere are potential crimes. I get it. Many of the things you \\\\nmentioned are things that Congress enacted in order----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. We are talking about 90 percent of the banking \\\\ncommunity here whom I am referring to----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I hear from a lot of financial providers who \\\\nare eager for us to crack down on some of the abuses that we \\\\nsee, because they have to compete with these people. They have \\\\nto be the ones competing online often with these \\\\nmisrepresentations. So, we take all the feedback. I have met, I \\\\nthink, with every State bankers association representing people \\\\non this committee, and maybe even more. We want to make sure \\\\nthat the law-abiding businesses are not disadvantaged by those \\\\nthat----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. I understand that, but----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. And, again, it is not a popularity contest.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. You are not receiving the feedback that, and \\\\nyou said to me in the last hearing that you would reach out \\\\nmore and have more of a comprehensive relationship or even get \\\\nfeedback from those who are knocking themselves out. You went \\\\nto the Warren School of Business. I know you have to believe in \\\\ncapitalism to an extent. It is a competitive marketplace. They \\\\nare trying to win customers. They are not trying to abuse their \\\\ncustomers. That would be ridiculous because they would go out \\\\nof business. That is how it works. The 81 total data points, \\\\nthe questions that were added, last time we spoke, you said it \\\\nis not 81. I forget what you said. It is, like, 18 or \\\\nsomething--no, it is, in fact, 81.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It is not 81. If you are asked a multiple \\\\nchoice question of what State do you live in, that is not 50 \\\\nquestions. That is one.\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. You expanded upon congressionally-authorized \\\\nquestions that you were given. Why is sexual orientation \\\\nsomething that a bank is supposed to ask----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Because in the statute, there are requirements \\\\non----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Not that.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. ----the demographic----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. Not in the statute.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The Supreme Court has ruled that discrimination \\\\nbased on sex----\\\\n    Mr. Meuser. That is an overreach. It is not in the \\\\ncongressional statute. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now go to the \\\\ngentleman from New York, Mr. Torres, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Torres. It is always a pleasure to see you, Director, \\\\nand I have found you to be as impressively communicative and \\\\nresponsive as any agency head in the Federal Government. Thank \\\\nyou for your commitment to protecting working people from \\\\npredatory fees.\\\\n    My first question is about remittances. I represent a \\\\ndistrict in the Bronx where families have to pay excessive fees \\\\nin order to transfer their own money to loved ones abroad, and \\\\nthe high fees and long delays of the existing remittance system \\\\nimposes a hardship on the lowest-income Americans, particularly \\\\nimmigrants. And as a nation of immigrants, as you know, the \\\\nUnited States is by far the largest source of remittances, with \\\\n$72 billion in 2021 alone. In your view, what can and should be \\\\ndone to create a better, cheaper, and faster remittance system \\\\nfor the most-vulnerable among us?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. There is so much. One, we need to make sure \\\\nthat the existing providers are not engaged in bait and switch, \\\\nthat they are telling the truth about how much it costs, and \\\\nthey are not hiding things with junk fees, but I think with \\\\ndigitization, we have also have to think more broadly. Lots of \\\\nyou have constituents who send money abroad. I see how in big \\\\ncommercial contexts, there are often agreements between large \\\\nbanks, between central banks. We should be thinking about the \\\\nplumbing of the financial system so that people can send things \\\\ncheaply and safely, and I think that requires the attention of \\\\nus, the Federal Reserve Board, and many others.\\\\n    Mr. Torres. I have a question about blockchains and \\\\nstablecoins in the context of remittances. Blockchains can \\\\nenable real-time transactions. Stablecoins can digitize the \\\\ndollar. Do you believe that the combination of blockchains and \\\\nstablecoins, if properly regulated, has the potential to play a \\\\nrole in creating a better, cheaper, and faster remittance \\\\nsystem?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We have seen that some digital apps and \\\\nother products have been able to actually help people send \\\\nmoney to a family member who is in a very remote area.\\\\n    Mr. Torres. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. They may not actually live near a bank or a \\\\nplace that has a remittance provider and are sometimes able to \\\\nuse that in ways that really kind of bridge the divide. Now, on \\\\nthe underlying technology, obviously, it is complicated. We \\\\nwant to make sure that it is well-regulated, that there is not \\\\nfraud, that people have a fair sense of what it is, but I am \\\\ntotally open to working with all of you as you think through \\\\nthat.\\\\n    Mr. Torres. Much has been said about AI, and AI is the most \\\\nrevolutionary technology of our time. I have found the \\\\ndiscourse about AI to be pessimistic to the point of \\\\napocalyptic. So, I am curious, what do you see not only as the \\\\ngreatest risk, but also the greatest reward of AI when it comes \\\\nto consumer protection in the field of financial services?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. In some ways, AI is not totally new. It is \\\\nreally advanced computational methods. There are lots of good \\\\nways to prevent fraud. There may be ways in which you could \\\\ndetect some sort of error in your finances, to help you \\\\nautomatically dispute something. There are certainly going to \\\\nbe consumer use cases. I think a little bit of where we should \\\\nbe cautious is throwing it out into the world and just kind of \\\\nseeing what happens. I think we should be thoughtful about how \\\\nare the different use cases, generative AI and copying of \\\\nbiometric data lending and how it would work in algorithms. So \\\\nwe should be precise on it, but I think there are \\\\nopportunities. I am not apocalyptic, but I want to make sure we \\\\nare being cautious.\\\\n    Mr. Torres. Is the CFPB exploring how to harness the power \\\\nof AI to enhance enforcement?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I think we are always looking at more \\\\nadvanced tools on how we analyze our compliance data, and other \\\\ndata to detect and deter wrongdoing, just as other law \\\\nenforcement does.\\\\n    Mr. Torres. On the subject of crypto regulation, the \\\\nagencies that typically come to mind are the CFTC and the SEC. \\\\nWhat is or should be the role of the CFPB in the field of \\\\ncrypto regulation?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It is less about the underlying technology and \\\\nmore about the use case. There has not been a huge \\\\nintersection, but, certainly, if you have a stablecoin that \\\\nvery rapidly scales on one of these payment apps, like another \\\\nconsumer payment, that is certainly a consumer use case there, \\\\nso that is a real place that we are watching it. But most of \\\\nthe other uses that we see in the financial markets are indeed \\\\noutside of consumer financial products.\\\\n    Mr. Torres. What are your existing authorities with respect \\\\nto stablecoin regulation?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The relevant ones that come up a lot are the \\\\nElectronic Fund Transfer Act, which is kind of fraud movement \\\\nof digital money, and privacy and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \\\\nprivacy provisions, but there are some other ones that get \\\\nimplicated as well.\\\\n    Mr. Torres. I see my time has expired. Thank you for your \\\\nservice.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. I am now going \\\\nto recognize myself for 5 minutes.\\\\n    I would like to insert a letter into the record from the \\\\nConsumer Bankers Association commenting on today&#x27;s hearing.\\\\n    Without objection, it is so ordered.\\\\n    Director Chopra, your recent Fair Credit Reporting Act \\\\nproposal on data brokers and consumer data doesn&#x27;t include a \\\\nfraud exemption when an entity is using data to help verify a \\\\ncustomer&#x27;s identity. The treatment of credit header data \\\\ndescribed in the outline would prohibit financial institutions \\\\nfrom using it for the essential antifraud purposes, for what it \\\\nis used for today, I guess. As you know, identity verification \\\\nand consideration for creditworthiness are two distinct actions \\\\nwith their own legal frameworks, KYC laws and the FCRA. Have \\\\nyou consulted with prudential regulators and the Financial \\\\nCrimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to understand how capturing \\\\nidentity verification activities under the FCRA may impede \\\\ncompliance with the Know Your Customer requirements if, in \\\\nfact, the data is considered a consumer report?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. Just to be clear, we have not put forth a \\\\nproposed rule. One of the places that we know there is a huge \\\\ndesire for fraudsters to take control over is really that \\\\nidentity-related data. So, we are trying to think of all the \\\\nways in which we can protect it but not undermine what banks \\\\nand lenders are legitimately trying to do for financial \\\\nservices. To answer your question, yes, certainly we have \\\\ndiscussions with the Treasury, FinCEN, and others on a wide \\\\nrange of issues, and I can assure you that I hear your message \\\\nhere loud and clear.\\\\n    We don&#x27;t want to do anything that undermines some of the \\\\nlegitimate financial companies&#x27; work, and I think it also goes \\\\nback to something Mr. Foster said about identity verification. \\\\nI really think all of us need to work on what is the future of \\\\nidentity verification because it can open up a lot of questions \\\\nfor harms in the country if we don&#x27;t have a robust one.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. Let me shift gears here. A small \\\\npediatrician office in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, has estimated that \\\\nthe CFPB&#x27;s proposal to remove medical debt from credit reports \\\\nwill lead to a revenue decrease by 11 percent, or $11,000. I \\\\nworry that further reducing the information that lenders have \\\\non borrowers is just going to result in higher costs and higher \\\\nrates for all. Is there any way that CFPB has studied this or \\\\ntried to figure out what the impact would be on individual \\\\nmedical clinics?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I think we are thinking about it in two \\\\ndifferent contexts: the medical provider facilities; and then, \\\\nseparately, the lenders. You raised two parts: what will be the \\\\nimpact for them; and what would be the impact on the credit \\\\nreporting system? On the second part, there has actually been a \\\\nmove away because of the limited predicted value of medical \\\\nbills on credit reporting. We have talked to a number in the \\\\nmedical industry, and many of them actually don&#x27;t put it on \\\\ncredit reports, and actually for most small players, I believe \\\\nthey don&#x27;t. We are really looking at all of that, and, again, \\\\nwe have not proposed a rule. We are going through the process \\\\nof collecting input in advance of proposing. We will then have \\\\npublic comments before we pursue it. But I will tell you, I am \\\\nconcerned about widespread inaccuracies in medical debt credit \\\\nreporting.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. One more on privacy. We have \\\\nheard from many Wisconsin bankers in discussions with their \\\\nsmall business customers about the 1071 reporting requirements, \\\\nwhich have been discussed many times today. They are concerned \\\\nabout the public release of the data.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. We are talking about villages of a thousand \\\\npeople, and some counties, actually, would find themselves, I \\\\nthink, in a similar situation. It would be very easy for \\\\nsomebody to sit down and kind of figure out who this is or \\\\nwhich family this is. Considering how important privacy is to \\\\nthe Bureau, why wouldn&#x27;t you first publish the results of the \\\\nre-identification study and then take comments, as required by \\\\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), to balance the risks \\\\nand the benefits of the disclosure?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We are pretty far away from any publication on \\\\nit, and let me just share with you that compared to mortgage \\\\ndata under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the data here is \\\\ngoing to be totally different. Like you said, there may only be \\\\none type of small business type in an area, so we are going to \\\\nlook at that. I will take that suggestion about how we might \\\\nproceed with that, but we are many years away.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Very good. I yield back. And at this time, \\\\nI recognize the gentlewoman from Colorado, Ms. Pettersen.\\\\n    Ms. Pettersen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it&#x27;s great to \\\\nsee you, Director Chopra. It is wonderful to have you here. You \\\\ndo a very good job of being in the hot seat.\\\\n    Being last, all of my questions have been asked, but one \\\\nthing that I have thought a lot about sitting through this is \\\\nwhat it was like to live in poverty, what it was like when I \\\\nwas younger, having multiple jobs while I worked my way through \\\\ncollege, putting myself through school, being just one \\\\nfinancial emergency away from being unable to pay for rent and \\\\nput a roof over my head. And when I think about those life \\\\nexperiences that are so important to have when you are sitting \\\\nin these seats, and understanding what people are struggling \\\\nwith every day, and how important your work is in fighting for \\\\nregular people, and who these junk fees can really have an \\\\nenormous impact on, or zombie debt. So, I just want to thank \\\\nyou for the work that you and your team do every day.\\\\n    And when I think about zombie debt in particular, I was \\\\nreflecting on when I was younger, in high school, and I had to \\\\ngo to the emergency room. I paid for it. Later on, when I was \\\\nqualifying to buy a house, it showed up again.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Credit report?\\\\n    Ms. Pettersen. No, I paid for it, but then it was sold off. \\\\nSo zombie debt, where it is paid years later, and you have no \\\\nproof, oftentimes lose that, and they know that, so they sell \\\\nit off knowing that is likely, and so many people in my life \\\\nhave dealt with this. And I remember being a young person and \\\\nfeeling like there was no accountability, nowhere to go. And I \\\\nknow recently, the CFPB had a field hearing on this issue \\\\naround zombie mortgages specifically, and I wanted to see how \\\\nyou all are thinking about what to do about zombie mortgages \\\\nand how they are targeting seniors, but also if there are gaps \\\\nthat Congress should consider addressing?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. Thank you for that, and let me just share \\\\none of the things that is really great about the work we do is \\\\nthat we actually get to hear directly from thousands of people \\\\na day about exactly those situations, and how it affects them, \\\\nand how we can fix things for them.\\\\n    On zombie mortgages, there was, and we think this is quite \\\\ntargeted in a few metro areas, but maybe nationwide, second \\\\nmortgages that were considered satisfied, but that have \\\\nreemerged and are targeting people sitting on home equity, \\\\noften seniors, zombie debt, more broadly, of things that just \\\\nkeep popping up over and over again, and the consumer is often \\\\nput in a place to prove they have paid it, even though it may \\\\nbe long ago. I think there are a lot of ways in which the \\\\ncredit report, too, is used to coerce people into paying this \\\\ndebt, debt parking.\\\\n    We do use our authorities under the Fair Debt Collection \\\\nPractices Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but I think it \\\\nis worthwhile to think if we need any sort of enhancements to \\\\nit in order to make sure that this type of what I see often as \\\\nfraud doesn&#x27;t recur.\\\\n    Ms. Pettersen. Great. Thank you for that. I know that you \\\\nare trying to change behavior by doubling down on going after \\\\njunk fees, and I don&#x27;t know if you want to talk quickly about \\\\nhow you all are identifying junk fees, and then also what you \\\\nare seeing with behavior changing from businesses and what that \\\\nmeans for consumers?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I think we have seen a number of very \\\\nlarge banks which engage in some hyper-aggressive illegal \\\\npractices. We reached two major enforcement actions: Wells \\\\nFargo, and Regions Bank. It was pretty bad conduct. We have \\\\nseen, though, a pretty big shift in the market of moving away \\\\nfrom some of these junk fees, and I think we have tried to go \\\\nto other industries to see where are they charging something \\\\nthat really is for nothing. I mentioned earlier to your \\\\ncolleague that we found a paper statement fee that they didn&#x27;t \\\\nprint or mail, so we have to make sure that this is just not \\\\nanother way to cheat people. We are very proud of that work, \\\\nand I think it has made a difference of billions of dollars.\\\\n    Ms. Pettersen. Great. With 20 seconds remaining, is there \\\\nanything else you want to add? I know that there were a lot of \\\\ntalk----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I have known some of you now for many years, \\\\nand I do hope that there are some things that we all see eye to \\\\neye on, including protecting data privacy, and junk fees. I \\\\nthink there is a lot we can do to really row in the same \\\\ndirection, so I appreciate all of you who have met with me to \\\\nreally help inform our work.\\\\n    Ms. Pettersen. Thank you very much. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentlewoman&#x27;s time has expired. We will \\\\nnow go to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Garbarino.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director, it is \\\\ngood to see you. It is great that Ms. Pettersen just asked \\\\nabout junk fees, because one of my other colleagues asked about \\\\nit before as well, and I am trying to get an actual answer. Are \\\\nfees for negative business transactions, late fees, overdraft \\\\nfees that are part of the contractual services provided by \\\\nfinancial institutions to customers who sign up for products \\\\nsuch as credit cards and checking accounts--would you consider \\\\nthose junk fees? Would you consider if someone signs up for a \\\\ncredit card or a bank account, a late fee or an overdraft fee?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Some of it is how it is assessed. For example, \\\\nI mentioned those two enforcement actions. Sometimes, they \\\\nassessed it by mixing around the transactions, and sometimes, \\\\nthey didn&#x27;t even deliver it.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. I agree. If they don&#x27;t deliver, if there is \\\\nno overdraft and they charge an overdraft fee, that is a \\\\nproblem, but if the statement says if you are late with your \\\\npayment or if the contract says if you are late with your \\\\npayment, we are charging you a late fee, or if you overdraft \\\\nand it is a legitimate overdraft, we are charging an overdraft \\\\nfee.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Are those junk fees? Would you consider----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think I am in agreement with the spirit of \\\\nwhat you are saying. The issue is that it can&#x27;t override \\\\nFederal law, so there can&#x27;t be deception around it. There are \\\\nother congressional prohibitions. And again, like Congresswoman \\\\nPettersen said, I do want to recognize that the industry has \\\\nmade some real moves on this, which I think are commendable.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. I get that, but late fees and overdraft fees \\\\naren&#x27;t blatantly junk fees.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It depends on how----\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. I agree, but----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, I take your point. Look, the way we define \\\\njunk fees are ones that are not subject to the competitive \\\\nprocess, really are hidden, or are sometimes for things that \\\\nare not even services or not even provided.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. I get that.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We try and focus on where it is illegal, or \\\\nfraudulent, but there are other places where you have a lot of \\\\nhonest banks out there competing on the upfront price and then \\\\nothers building a business model off of something.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. I understand that. My point is, if a \\\\ncontract says that if you are late paying your credit card \\\\nstatement, we are going to charge you $25, and somebody is a \\\\nweek late, it is pretty straightforward.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. It also has to comply with Federal law.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Of course, yes. I want to move on to \\\\nsomething else. I want to talk about an issue, and it is \\\\nrelated to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) proposal and \\\\nthe data brokers. From what I understand, the CFPB is \\\\nconsidering significant changes to the FCRA, including \\\\nbroadening the scope of what constitutes a consumer reporting \\\\nagency to basically any entity that compiles and makes \\\\navailable consumer financial information, whether or not it is \\\\nused for eligibility decisions. Currently, the Bureau&#x27;s \\\\nauthority is limited to regulations that are necessary and \\\\nappropriate to carry out the objectives of the FCRA. However, \\\\nthe SBREFA includes a broad and novel definition of, ``data \\\\nbroker,&#x27;&#x27; which seems to contradict decades of regulatory \\\\nguidance, case law, and congressional intent. It also creates \\\\nconflicts with the KYC requirements.\\\\n    Given those contradictions, where in the CFPB&#x27;s limited \\\\nrulemaking authority does it have the ability to create the new \\\\ndefinition of, ``data broker?&#x27;&#x27;\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. I don&#x27;t agree with what you just shared \\\\nthere. One of the pieces of input you all have given us is to \\\\ntry and avoid, where we can, regulation by enforcement. There \\\\nare a lot of companies out there that meet the definition and \\\\nactivities of a consumer reporting agency. Yes, we could go and \\\\nlitigate it, bring enforcement actions. The goal is, in some \\\\nways, to provide some clarity about the business model of a \\\\nconsumer reporting agency, which now you have a lot of \\\\ndifferent firms that are collecting these dossiers on us, and \\\\nto create a level playing field around it.\\\\n    You mentioned the issue of KYC fraud. As I shared with \\\\nCongressman Fitzgerald, we are taking that very seriously and \\\\nlooking at all of the uses of it. But I think we need to be \\\\ncareful about data brokers often compiling information about \\\\nAmericans and often selling our most-sensitive data to bad \\\\nactors overseas, including to defraud people.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. I understand, but I just want to make sure, \\\\nso you think you already have the authority, the CFPB already \\\\nhas the authority to do all this with the new----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes, because we have to make sure that we are \\\\nadministering the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and if you look at \\\\neven the legislative history----\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. You believe you have it under the----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We can&#x27;t propose a rule on anything that \\\\nwe wouldn&#x27;t have it.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. I understand. I think there is a \\\\ndisagreement of whether or not----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We can talk about it. I am happy to talk about \\\\nit.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Okay. I appreciate that. I have another \\\\nquestion, but I am down to 10 seconds, and I know I won&#x27;t get \\\\nit out. I will submit it to you for the record.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Sure.\\\\n    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. Next, we have \\\\nthe gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the ranking \\\\nmember as well, who is not here at this time, but I also thank \\\\nMs. Garcia. And I thank you for appearing today, sir. It is my \\\\nbelief that if we did not have the CFPB, we would need to \\\\ncreate it, and what I would like to do is explore some of the \\\\nrationale for my contention.\\\\n    The staff has done an excellent job in providing \\\\nintelligence. There is an indication that the agency has \\\\nrequired financial firms that violate the law to pay more than \\\\n$4.1 billion in civil penalties. As a former litigator, I \\\\nunderstand the difference between a class action and a small \\\\naction. What would these persons have to do, if not for the \\\\nCFPB, to collect this amount in penalties? What would they have \\\\nto do without the CFPB?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We have obtained, I believe, about $20 \\\\nbillion in forfeitures. There is no way that people would have \\\\nbeen able to get all of this on their own, and in some ways, \\\\nCongressman, they may not have even known about the error or \\\\nthe mischarge. We have been using our complaints and sometimes \\\\ncan see the trends that it is not just 30 or 40, but it is \\\\n30,000 or 40,000, and I think we have had maybe tens of \\\\nmillions of people who directly benefited from those. And look, \\\\nwe should want a marketplace where people are playing by the \\\\nrules, and we try and help firms that do, but where they don&#x27;t, \\\\nwe do have to take action.\\\\n    Mr. Green. I am proud that you do. Let&#x27;s explore one \\\\nadditional area: illegal discrimination. We found that a \\\\ncertain bank--no need to mention the name--discriminated and \\\\nwas ordered to pay $25.9 million. This type of litigation \\\\nusually is long term, meaning it would be 3 to 5 years. This is \\\\nwhat the consumer would have to suffer, just the time alone, \\\\nand then to find a lawyer who would do this for an individual, \\\\nyou would have to have some deep pockets. Explain, if you \\\\nwould, as tersely as you would like, why it is so important \\\\nthat you engage in these illegal discrimination actions?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Many times, people wouldn&#x27;t even know they were \\\\nthe victim of it. In the case you mentioned, those individuals \\\\nwere given fake reasons why they were denied, but in reality, \\\\nit was because they were Armenian American. They wouldn&#x27;t have \\\\neven known to do it, and so we have to make sure that we are \\\\ndetecting it and taking action.\\\\n    Mr. Green. I started with the premise that if we didn&#x27;t \\\\nhave the CFPB, we would need to create it. Sadly, this Congress \\\\nwould never do it. Thank God, we have it now, because we \\\\ncouldn&#x27;t get it if we didn&#x27;t already have it. I yield back the \\\\nbalance of my time.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now go to the \\\\ngentlewoman from California, Mrs. Kim.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Thank you. And, Director Chopra, thank you for \\\\nbeing with us today. From its inception, the way the CFPB was \\\\ndesigned disregarded longstanding checks and balances. Under \\\\nour Constitution, no one agency or person shall have absolute \\\\npower to do as they please. Even the President is accountable \\\\nto Congress and to the power of the purse, and the CFPB should \\\\nnot be the exception to longstanding constitutional rules. I \\\\nthink we agree on that.\\\\n    And I do agree with the mission that consumers must be \\\\nprotected from bad actors. The CFPB, in the name of consumer \\\\nprotection, is being used to divert the public&#x27;s attention from \\\\nthe real challenges faced by individuals and families. And the \\\\nCFPB, under your watch, Mr. Chopra, has not addressed the root \\\\ncauses of indebtedness, of poor economic conditions for \\\\nmillions of Americans. And in your testimony, you highlight \\\\nthat for the first time ever, credit card debt eclipsed $2 \\\\ntrillion last year, and you also mentioned the cost of high \\\\ninterest rates for consumers, but unfortunately, you don&#x27;t \\\\nmention inflation once in your testimony.\\\\n    You are a member of FSOC, and so you should have been privy \\\\nto discussions on how fiscal expansionary measures fueled \\\\ninflation. If you recall, everyone in the Biden Administration \\\\nwas stating that inflation is transitory, when, in fact, we all \\\\nknow that it wasn&#x27;t. Why did you fail to mention inflation in \\\\nyour testimony?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly, higher cost of goods--I think I \\\\nspecifically mentioned examples of it, I am happy to look back \\\\nat it, and the examples of higher vehicle prices. There are \\\\ncertainly issues with higher home prices. Of course, prices and \\\\nthe rate environment, we do see both as being drivers. The rate \\\\nenvironment, I think, has also, as mentioned by one of your \\\\ncolleagues, dramatically increased the price of new mortgage \\\\norigination. So, they are both certainly something we think \\\\nabout in consumer financial products.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Thank you. Since consumers had to pay more for \\\\ngoods and services, would you agree that inflation played a \\\\nrole in increasing indebtedness to Americans?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If you look at the amount of household debt \\\\nrelative to net worth, we can share with you the trend lines, \\\\nbut it is not our job to really look at what exactly is \\\\nhappening with respect to each individual good. But we, of \\\\ncourse, know that when there are higher prices, when there are \\\\nhigher rates, that is going to affect people, and certainly the \\\\nFederal Reserve Board is the one that----\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Thank you. I mentioned that, because we had a \\\\npeak of 9.1 percent inflation in 2022, I think around June, and \\\\nthat was the highest rate in 40 years, so I just wanted to \\\\npoint that out. I know Chairman McHenry mentioned this earlier, \\\\nand I share his concern, because back in August of last year or \\\\nthis year, I led a letter with the Chair of our Financial \\\\nInstitutions Subcommittee, Chairman Andy Barr, and there were \\\\n17 of my colleagues who sent a letter voicing our concerns \\\\nregarding the announcement of the informal dialogue between the \\\\nCFPB and the European Commission, and in that letter, we \\\\nspecifically asked the CFPB to brief this committee. I want to \\\\nask you again, will you commit to briefing this committee, \\\\nbecause we want to ensure that the EU is not exporting their \\\\nfinancial laws and regulations in the United States.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly. Let me be clear, we are not cutting \\\\nand pasting anything from there. We are having a meeting, a \\\\nseries of meetings because many of the issues, particularly----\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. I just need your commitment. We haven&#x27;t gotten \\\\nthe briefing----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Actually, if I could just finish----\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. ----that we asked for.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We face some serious global threats when it \\\\ncomes to some of the issues, particularly from bad actors based \\\\nin China and Russia, and I do think that we need some global \\\\ncooperation on this. Yes, we will brief you----\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Okay. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. ----but we are having meetings with them.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Then, we can have that further conversation----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We are having meetings with them----\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. ----when you come and brief us----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. ----because there are some very serious issues.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Let me reclaim my time, because I do want to ask \\\\nanother question regarding the CFPB&#x27;s SBREFA outline because on \\\\nthat, the FCRA proposal raised concerns about legal versus \\\\nfactual disputes, and there is considerable case law and \\\\nsupervision guidance around factual disputes because those \\\\nquestions can be determined by reinvestigation. The resolution \\\\nof a legal dispute depends upon information that is generally \\\\nnot reported to a consumer reporting agency, so how could a \\\\ncredit bureau make a determination on a legal matter?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Mr. Chairman, may I respond?\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentlelady is out of time.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We will answer for the record.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. We can get that in writing, I am sure.\\\\n    Mrs. Kim. Okay. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. What we are going to do is, because there \\\\nis an open roll call going on right now, we are going to go to \\\\nCongressman Flood, and then we are going to recess. We have \\\\nfour more members, but it should be very quickly because there \\\\nare only two votes, and then we will come back in and finish \\\\nwith those four members. Next, we will recognize the gentleman \\\\nfrom Nebraska, Mr. Flood.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you to the very capable chairman from \\\\nWisconsin. Mr. Chopra, I would like to focus on the CFPB&#x27;s \\\\nrecent rulemaking for larger participants in the market of \\\\ndigital consumer payments. This rulemaking covers a lot of \\\\nground, from third-party platforms used in small businesses \\\\nacross the country, to digital asset wallets. Let&#x27;s start with \\\\nthe implications for digital assets.\\\\n    When describing the supervisory authority that the Bureau&#x27;s \\\\nlarger participant rulemaking would give to the CFPB, there is \\\\na footnote explaining, and it says, ``The CFPB&#x27;s supervisory \\\\nauthority is not limited to the products or services that \\\\nqualified the person for supervision, but also includes other \\\\nactivities.&#x27;&#x27; In my view, this footnote signals that the \\\\nrulemaking will cover far more than the, ``general use digital \\\\nconsumer payment applications.&#x27;&#x27; Can you comment on the CFPB&#x27;s \\\\nintentions surrounding the scope of this rulemaking?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I wouldn&#x27;t misread that. We are looking to make \\\\nsure there is a level playing field between the banks and \\\\ncredit unions that offer these services and the large nonbanks. \\\\nWe already have enforcement authority over all of these \\\\nentities that would be covered. It wouldn&#x27;t create any kind of \\\\nnew jurisdiction, but what we are doing is going through the \\\\nrulemaking process to establish for certain larger \\\\nparticipants, are they following the existing law? We could go \\\\nthrough that process by an enforcement investigation. That is \\\\nmore adversarial.\\\\n    I think this is a little bit more of a way to make sure \\\\nthat there are not harms, given some of them really are \\\\ntouching tens of millions of customers. But I think I hear the \\\\nconcern, which is kind of going outside of the jurisdiction, \\\\nbut we can only supervise and enforce the laws that Congress \\\\nhas specifically designated for us.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Given that the rule does not cover some digital \\\\nasset transactions, like an investor purchasing bitcoin through \\\\na brokerage account, but does cover others, how would the CFPB \\\\ndistinguish between the different types of transactions \\\\nconducted by the same digital asset wallet?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes. We are going to have to deal with that. I \\\\nthink most of what we are going to be doing is focused on ones \\\\nwhere it is really consumer payments. Inasmuch that they are \\\\ndoing two different activities, we have a lot of familiarity \\\\nwith how to do this. Many of our banks have broker-dealers \\\\naffiliated with them. They have commercial businesses that we \\\\ndon&#x27;t cover, so when we do an examination, we explain we are \\\\ncovering the activities under Federal consumer financial \\\\nprotection.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Do you think the CFPB has Regulation E authority \\\\nover transactions using a digital asset, like a stablecoin, to \\\\npurchase a consumer good or service?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act covers the \\\\ntransfer of funds. There are certain exceptions for when it is \\\\nfor trading of securities. I think there are other exceptions \\\\nthere. Overall, when you have a consumer payment for household \\\\nuse, I think the case law would suggest that is covered, but we \\\\nare collecting comments on this just to make sure, and we have \\\\nbeen pretty judicious on this point. I have raised with \\\\nChairman McHenry and others that, inasmuch that you all enact \\\\nanything, we will need to make sure that it is well-reflected.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. I would like to quickly switch gears and discuss \\\\nsome of the non-digital asset implications of the rule. Given \\\\nthat third-party payment processing tools are popular among \\\\nsmall businesses, how can you be sure that this rule wouldn&#x27;t \\\\nresult in some of the cost of compliance being passed down to \\\\nthese small businesses?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The rule proposes only for larger participants, \\\\nso we proposed a threshold for which we are getting comments, \\\\nso it is really not supposed to implicate small businesses, and \\\\nit is really focused on those consumer payments. I will keep my \\\\neye out for that, but again, there is not any kind of new \\\\nauthority. We currently have enforcement and other authorities \\\\nover these firms already.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. I appreciate that. The cost-benefit analysis in \\\\nthis rule states that the Bureau lacks sufficient information \\\\nto predict how compliance costs would be, ``borne by providers \\\\nor passed on to the consumers.&#x27;&#x27; However, you certified that \\\\nthe proposed rule would not have significant impacts on small \\\\nentities, and therefore, the rule wouldn&#x27;t need to go through \\\\nthe small business panel process. I have 20 seconds left, so \\\\nquickly, how can you assert the rule will not have an effect on \\\\nsmall businesses if the analysis fails to even attempt to weigh \\\\nthe rule&#x27;s compliance costs?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think the proposal exempts small business.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Okay. I will look at that. Thank you, Mr. \\\\nChairman.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I will let you know if it is something \\\\ndifferent.\\\\n    Mr. Flood. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We will now take \\\\na brief recess.\\\\n    [recess]\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Director Chopra, thank you for hanging in \\\\nthere, and we will go first to the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. \\\\nNunn, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Director \\\\nChopra, for hanging in here. It is a marathon today, but it is \\\\nimportant for all of us to be able to go through this.\\\\n    I want to follow up on a number of items that were brought \\\\nup from some local bankers in my community in Iowa. There are \\\\nmany folks in the Midwest who are trying to do the best they \\\\ncan to keep up with what seems like an ever-changing regulatory \\\\nenvironment, and it puts both an economic burden on them as \\\\nwell as just a challenge to be able to support the customers \\\\nand communities that I exist in. Some of the words that they \\\\nhave described to me in their dealings with your agency have \\\\nbeen that the guidance is unclear. It is not always concise. In \\\\nfact, sometimes it is conflicting. Some have called it \\\\npartisan, and others have said that it is analytically weak.\\\\n    To get us all on the same page here, I would like to just \\\\ngo over what the CFPB has that is unique to your organization, \\\\nthat is different from a lot of others. First, let&#x27;s be clear: \\\\nYou are not under the appropriations clause, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The appropriations clause?\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Yes. You are funded by the Federal Reserve, not \\\\ndirectly through any appropriations?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The appropriations clause is in the \\\\nConstitution.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Right, and you are not under it, correct?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Not right now.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Yes. Second, you don&#x27;t have an independent \\\\nInspector General, do you?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Our Inspector General is with the Federal \\\\nReserve. They oversee both of us.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. They oversee the Federal Reserve, but you don&#x27;t \\\\nreport to the Inspector General. They oversee the entire aspect \\\\nof it. Do you have an executive board?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Okay. I find the collection of those three things \\\\nconcerning, and that is an issue for Dodd-Frank that we can \\\\ntake up as we go forward. Now, when you and I last spoke, we \\\\ncame on the heels of roughly a quarter of a million Americans \\\\nwho had had their data hemorrhaged by the CFPB. I was hopeful \\\\nthat when we spoke in June, we were going to get a written \\\\nafter-action report on this. Has your office had the time to \\\\nreview this and provide any kind of written after-action report \\\\non what happened with that leak?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Again, the misappropriation theft of data by an \\\\ninsider threat was completely serious. We are continuing to \\\\ncooperate with all law enforcement related to that, including \\\\nany criminal law enforcement. With respect to changes we have \\\\nmade, we are happy to brief you----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I am asking you, Director, if you have provided a \\\\nreport to Congress on exactly what happened?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We have complied with all of the pieces of it. \\\\nIf there are specific questions about what happened----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I want to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen again.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I do, too.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Please provide us with a written after-action \\\\nreport on what occurred so we don&#x27;t have this again. Thank you.\\\\n    I want to turn now to Section 1071. I know it has been part \\\\nof an ongoing conversation today, and you are statutorily \\\\nobligated under Dodd-Frank to collect a number of data points. \\\\nAs I understand it, it has now swollen to 81. In fact, you have \\\\nexceeded your mandate by about 25 points.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Sorry. Just to be clear, that is not accurate.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Okay. Please describe to me where I am incorrect?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. There are 81 data fields, so I am just going to \\\\ngive an example, which is not in the rule, but it helps to----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I think that we can equivocate over how you want \\\\nto call it.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. But if you----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. There are 81 different items that members who \\\\nwant to review this would have to fill out. Is that correct?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Again, I am trying to explain that. There are \\\\nnot 81 different items. We create a template for how people can \\\\nreport. So if you have a first name, a middle name, a last \\\\nname, and a suffix, in order for the data to be cleanly \\\\nunderstood, that might count as five----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. So, there are a total of 81 different fields that \\\\nneed to be filled out. I am going to follow up on this because, \\\\nagain, you went above and beyond the requirement here by 25 \\\\nadditional requests. I want to understand how this information \\\\nis going to be used. Let&#x27;s be very clear here. Is this \\\\ninformation going to be publicly available?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. There is not going to be personally \\\\nidentifiable information. We&#x27;re going to----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Will any of the information be publicly \\\\navailable?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If you will let me finish, we are going to go \\\\nthrough a process, just like exists in mortgage data, to figure \\\\nout what type of----\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. Director, are you going to provide this \\\\ninformation publicly, or is it going to stay internal to the \\\\nCFPB?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. As I just shared, just like the Home Mortgage \\\\nDisclosure Act data, there will be certain analyses and data \\\\nthat will be made public, but that is years away.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I believe it is the intent of the CFPB right now \\\\nto potentially publicly shame a number of organizations, \\\\nincluding my bank, Union State Bank, in East Peru, Iowa. It has \\\\n15 employees, a population of 200 citizens, and they have a \\\\nvery different profile than what may be in a place like \\\\nPittsburgh. But East Peru, for them, if they don&#x27;t meet the \\\\nstandards that you have laid out here in your diversity and \\\\ninclusion, there is a real chance that they could be publicly \\\\nshamed.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No, that is not true, but the data that will be \\\\nused for the Community Reinvestment Act are not going to be \\\\nduplicative data. I am out of time, but I am happy to take that \\\\nquestion.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I want to----\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\\\\n    Mr. Nunn. I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Next, we will go to the gentlewoman from \\\\nTexas, Ms. De La Cruz.\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this \\\\nhearing today, and thank you, Director Chopra, for appearing \\\\nbefore us today.\\\\n    I serve a largely rural community, a Latino community in \\\\ndeep South Texas, south of San Antonio, and my constituents \\\\nrely heavily on smaller banks, community banks, and credit \\\\nunions. And this is really important for their livelihoods, and \\\\nfor the economic development of our communities. It worries me \\\\nincreasingly, as I hear from these community banks that your \\\\nagency remains insulated and unchecked by Congress while \\\\ncreating rules that directly impact constituents in my area.\\\\n    The rule that really concerns me is the 1071 rule. We have \\\\nheard over and over today how it is going to affect community \\\\nbanks, how it is going to affect small business owners like \\\\nmyself, and, ultimately, who is most important are the \\\\nconsumers, the entrepreneurs. So, I hope that today you are \\\\nhearing the message that the 1071 rule is just simply not \\\\nworking. It is not going to work for community banks, it is not \\\\ngoing to work for communities that want to thrive, and it is \\\\nnot going to work for small business owners.\\\\n    This seems to be an expensive endeavor for community banks \\\\nto implement, not only with training for staff, but \\\\nimplementation of new software. For the people listening right \\\\nnow on C-SPAN, we are talking about going from 15 data points \\\\nto 81 data points. That is an incredible increase, and what it \\\\nis really doing is profiling customers who have never been \\\\nprofiled before. Not only is it going to take a significant \\\\namount of time to profile these customers, asking questions \\\\nsuch as sexual orientation, which, remember, banking has been \\\\nbuilt on being able to look at a project, look at credit \\\\nscores, look at debt ratios, and to be able to make an analysis \\\\naway and apart from profiling customers. Now, because of the \\\\n1071 rule, they are actually going to have to start \\\\nimplementing and profiling customers. I am worried about the \\\\ncosts that it is going to take to comply with the 1071 rule.\\\\n    I want to know, do you recognize that this rule may result \\\\nin less availability of credit to small businesses that it \\\\ntargets, particularly if it leads to smaller banks having to \\\\npull back from lending due to the costs associated to the 1071 \\\\nrule?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Let me just share with you what we saw during \\\\nthe Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), that actually the small \\\\ncommunity institutions you mentioned really punched above their \\\\nweight class when it comes to serving small businesses. Many of \\\\nthem have those relationships, so we were under a court order \\\\nto complete the final rule by March of this year. The CFPB was \\\\nsued a few years ago for not doing the rule. We complied with \\\\nthe court order. We increased the loan threshold, which \\\\nexempted a large number. I don&#x27;t have the exact number of small \\\\nbanks, but, of course, I share with you that we want a robust \\\\nand really fair small business lending market. This is really \\\\nthe fabric----\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. I am going to reclaim my time quickly here. \\\\nWhen was the last time you actually spoke to a community bank \\\\nabout this rule?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I have conducted sessions with, I think, every \\\\nsingle bankers association represented in this committee and \\\\nmore. I think I have met now with thousands of community \\\\nbankers, and you are right, many of them, in fact, do mention \\\\nthis and other issues. I have done branch visits as well in \\\\nseveral places----\\\\n    Ms. De La Cruz. And I am going to reclaim my time again. I \\\\nthink it is more than just a couple of them or some of them. \\\\nEvery single community bank that I hear from says this is a \\\\nproblem, and this is going to create a lot of problems for not \\\\nonly the banks, but the consumers, the small businesses, and \\\\nfor the economic well-being and prosperity of our communities. \\\\nI yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentlewoman yields back. We now go to \\\\nthe gentlewoman from Indiana, Mrs. Houchin.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the \\\\nranking member. And thanks, Director Chopra, for your testimony \\\\nand for being here on this long day.\\\\n    Since you were last here a few months ago, the CFPB has \\\\ncontinued to put forward what I view as politically-motivated \\\\nrules that go beyond your statutory authority. Despite my \\\\ncolleagues and I making our concerns known to you at the last \\\\nhearing, I still frequently hear from constituents about the \\\\nlack of input on rulemaking, the failure to tailor regulations \\\\ntowards smaller institutions, and an almost impossible-to-\\\\nnavigate landscape that comes from the CFPB&#x27;s continued \\\\nregulation by press release. It is beyond concerning, and we \\\\nare going to continue to push on these issues.\\\\n    Director Chopra, my colleagues and I have previously made \\\\nour concerns known to you about the continued pattern of \\\\nregulation by press release, and when that fails, regulation by \\\\nenforcement. To one of my colleagues earlier in this hearing, \\\\nyou said that the Bureau has, ``tried to articulate guidance \\\\nthrough the various laws that we have enforced.&#x27;&#x27; How is a \\\\nbusiness supposed to know what guidance exists if they aren&#x27;t \\\\nmade aware of any wrongdoing until the CFPB alleges misconduct \\\\nhas occurred and forces a business to pay a fine?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I don&#x27;t think that is the case. I think that we \\\\ntry our best, and based on feedback from many industry groups, \\\\nincluding the Consumer Bankers Association (CBA), to be able to \\\\npublish information that answers questions about how to comply.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. I am glad you mentioned the Consumer Bankers \\\\nAssociation. They recently reached out to me on Dodd-Frank \\\\nSection 1034(c) and the advisory opinion that was recently \\\\npublished by the Bureau. They are concerned that it is \\\\ndifficult to understand, and it is vague in what is the scope \\\\nof it and what isn&#x27;t. It is a significant policy. Stakeholders \\\\nare required to comply with this within 2 months. And I \\\\nunderstand that the Consumer Bankers Association recently \\\\nreached out to request a meeting with CFPB staff, but the CFPB \\\\nrejected their meeting request. Why would your staff reject a \\\\nmeeting with an important stakeholder like the CBA, and will \\\\nyou ensure this is corrected so that industry stakeholders can \\\\nengage with you and get a deeper understanding of what is \\\\nrequired?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. You actually raised such a good example. \\\\nCongress passed that part of the statute. That is law. It is \\\\nthe law of the land.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. My question is, why would----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If I could finish.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. The question is----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Instead of just bringing----\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. I am reclaiming----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. ----an enforcement action----\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. You are not answering my question, \\\\nrespectfully. Why would your staff refuse a meeting with the \\\\nCBA, and will you ensure it is corrected so these stakeholders \\\\ncan engage with you to get an understanding----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I am happy to look into that and make sure \\\\nthat----\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Will you, yes, ensure that you will meet with \\\\nthe CBA?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think our staff meets with associations all \\\\nthe time, but I will check into that for you.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Will you commit that your staff will meet \\\\nwith the CBA?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Sure.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Okay.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We will have someone meet----\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. They have meetings with us regularly.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Perfect. I want to go back to this regulating \\\\nby press release. Under what authority does the CFPB govern by \\\\npress release, and why is it not clearly declaring rules and \\\\ngoing through the appropriate regulatory and administrative \\\\nprocesses, such as the APA?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We are complying with the APA, and if you want \\\\nto share more detail about, ``regulation by press release,&#x27;&#x27; I \\\\ndon&#x27;t even actually know what that term means. We put out \\\\nregulations through the regulatory process. We have received \\\\nfeedback that we should publish important developments, and \\\\nyes, we do post information on our website.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. So until a rule is made final, any \\\\nannouncements you have made to the fact are not enforceable?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No, the regulation and the statute is what \\\\ngoverns it.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Great.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The press releases are there to say we are \\\\ncollecting comments. We have published this guidance. We have \\\\nissued this report.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. So, you are not making enforcements based on \\\\nrules that have not been promulgated 100 percent?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We would not win those in court.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. But the question is not would you win them in \\\\ncourt, but are you making enforcement actions?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If you have a specific example of that, I am \\\\nhappy to discuss it with you, but we are often attempting to \\\\nissue the guidance in response to industry questions. This is a \\\\nprogram that Director Kraninger, my predecessor, started that \\\\nwe have continued. And I am happy to address real concerns \\\\nwherever they emerge.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. Do you agree with the well-established \\\\nprinciple that if an action is establishing a new obligation on \\\\ncovered entities, it must go through the notice-and-comment \\\\nrulemaking process in order to be enforceable?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. The statute often creates the obligations. We \\\\noften issue guidance to say this is really how we intend to \\\\nsupervise for it. It is for transparency. I am trying to also \\\\nreact to you are saying that there is regulation by \\\\nenforcement. We are doing all these things to help avoid that.\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. I just want to know if you are, and I would \\\\nbe happy to talk to you----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We are complying with the Administrative \\\\nProcedure Act (APA).\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentlewoman----\\\\n    Mrs. Houchin. ----further about this. I appreciate it.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentlewoman&#x27;s time has expired. We now \\\\ngo to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Lawler.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director, thanks for \\\\nbeing here today, and you are here today at a time of \\\\nsignificant economic concern, as concern continues over \\\\ninflation, rising interest rates, and families struggling with \\\\nexpenses. I know some of my colleagues have alluded to \\\\nsignificant concerns about the effects of regulations coming \\\\nout of your agency and the potential cost-benefit analysis. And \\\\nclearly, we have serious concerns about how you are ensuring \\\\nthe cost of regulations and other CFPB actions do not outweigh \\\\nany potential benefit, particularly since those costs will \\\\nlikely be passed on to consumers.\\\\n    The fintech sector has helped to provide credit access, \\\\nparticularly for low- and middle-income individuals, and many \\\\nof these providers are also pioneering strong consumer \\\\nprotection. I am concerned that overly-broad regulations \\\\nthreaten to kill innovative, law-abiding fintechs, registration \\\\nof nonbanks, for instance, or the 1071 small business lending \\\\nrule. What kind of cost-benefit analysis is the CFPB engaging \\\\nin to make sure that you are not harming vulnerable consumers \\\\nin the name of protecting consumers?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly, with respect to rulemaking, we are \\\\nunder certain obligations to publish a regulatory flexibility \\\\nanalysis, including to look at where the costs are. Sometimes, \\\\nwhen it comes to benefits, such as the benefits of getting a \\\\ncredit report corrected, or avoiding an illegal foreclosure, it \\\\ncan be hard to estimate, but we comply with all of that. And \\\\nlet me just share, I agree with you that we want all sorts of \\\\ncompanies, particularly small and new ones, to be able to \\\\ncompete against the big guys, and ideally, rules, including \\\\nlaws that you pass, can be clear and even bright line so that \\\\nthere is no ambiguity about it. And sometimes we strive for \\\\nthat, but often the laws that are passed, new situations come \\\\nup, and we are trying to figure out how to make sure that those \\\\nsmall and nascent players can really compete to the benefit of \\\\neveryone.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Are there instances where you could see low- \\\\nand middle-income consumers being harmed by an overly-\\\\naggressive CFPB regulatory regime?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Certainly, I have seen many instances. I used \\\\nto be a Commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, and that \\\\nagency, many years ago, used to have a history of targeting \\\\nsmall businesses who couldn&#x27;t defend themselves, and strong-\\\\narming them into settlements, and that kind of fear, obviously, \\\\ncould impact those entrepreneurs and those consumers.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Do you see that happening now at the CFPB?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. No. Actually, one of the things we have done is \\\\nwe really try to focus, especially on the enforcement side, on \\\\nrepeat offenders, large players, those who know they were \\\\nengaged in wrongdoing. We also make sure that in our \\\\nsupervision program, we are really tailoring it based on risk \\\\nand not overburdening. Again, I take the feedback seriously. We \\\\nalways need to push ourselves to make sure that the system is \\\\nserving everybody well, and there is fierce competition.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. Previously, the CFPB&#x27;s Office of Innovation was \\\\nfocused on encouraging consumer-friendly innovation by creating \\\\napproved safe harbors, removing barriers to entry, and \\\\nenhancing competition in the marketplace. In 2019, the CFPB \\\\nrolled out several policies, including the Compliance \\\\nAssistance Sandbox Policy and the No Action Letter Policy, to \\\\nfacilitate compliance and promote innovation. Just 3 years \\\\nlater, however, the CFPB rescinded these policies entirely. Why \\\\ndid the CFPB reverse its decision to help emerging fintech \\\\ncompanies enter the market, especially considering the Bureau&#x27;s \\\\nfocus on the importance of competition?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Pretty recently, we have made sure that some of \\\\nthose programs are still doing work. We approved an application \\\\nfor those representing small banks on construction loans to do \\\\nalternatives, and we are going through that process. Some of \\\\nthe programs you mentioned, we did a review of, and they \\\\nbasically did nothing to spur innovation or competition, and we \\\\nfound that the recipients of those letters were, in some cases, \\\\nmarketing themselves as endorsed or approved. So, I think what \\\\nwe are focused on is programs that affect lots of market \\\\nparticipants, but don&#x27;t crown one winner. Government shouldn&#x27;t \\\\nbe picking winners and losers like that.\\\\n    Mr. Lawler. My time is expiring, so I yield back.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. We now recognize \\\\nthe gentleman from Florida, Mr. Donalds, for 5 minutes.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. Director Chopra, how are you doing? It&#x27;s good \\\\nto see you again.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. It&#x27;s good to see you, too, sir.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. Okay. It has been a long day. Hey, listen, \\\\nfrom what I understand, the CFPB is considering significant \\\\nchanges to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including broadening \\\\nthe scope of what constitutes a consumer reporting agency to \\\\nbasically include any entity that compiles and makes available \\\\nconsumer financial information, whether or not it is used for \\\\neligibility decisions. The Bureau&#x27;s authority is limited to \\\\nregulations that are necessary and appropriate to carrying out \\\\nthe objectives of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The Small \\\\nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act outline includes a \\\\nbroad and novel definition of, ``data broker,&#x27;&#x27; which seems to \\\\ncontradict decades of regulatory guidance, case law, and \\\\ncongressional intent. In your view, where is the CFPB getting \\\\nthe authority, under its limited rulemaking provisions, to \\\\ncreate this new definition of a data broker?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I am happy to share more information with you \\\\nfrom the outline, but we have lots of data brokers assembling \\\\ndossiers on all of us that are being used for a whole set of \\\\npurposes, including sales to state and nonstate actors.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. I understand that, but----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. We are trying to----\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. Hold on.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Go ahead.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. But, Director, where does the CFPB get the \\\\nadditional authority to make a rule around this or to expand \\\\nthat definition, because that is a congressional provision? \\\\nThat is not for an agency to make that determination.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. If it is a consumer reporting agency, and I \\\\nshared this before, I think it is better for us to go through \\\\nthe process of explaining what are the indicia that would \\\\ntrigger these obligations. We can pursue it through an \\\\nenforcement-only process, but we are studying the market to see \\\\nhow these consumer reporting agencies have evolved over time. \\\\nWe have lots of background screening companies, tenant \\\\nscreening companies, and others. They all comply.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. I am well aware----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. That is what we are trying to do. We are only \\\\ngoing to use the statute as Congress has written it.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. I would say that sounds good, but looking at \\\\nthe history of agencies in Congress, when we are initially \\\\ntold, ``we will only use it for,&#x27;&#x27; it is always expanded at \\\\nsome point in the future. That is my concern. But I want to \\\\nswitch gears.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. You should amend the statute, then.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. Now, that is something that I think we \\\\nprobably would find agreement on----\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I totally support----\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. Congress should do its job and amend statutes \\\\nas necessary.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I totally support that, and it is easier for \\\\nthe agencies when you all agree on these privacy issues, \\\\nemerging issues. We are very happy to work with you on them. It \\\\nmakes things easier.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. I am going to reclaim my time.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Sorry.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. One thing I would say is that I think that if \\\\nCongress actually takes its article on power seriously, which I \\\\nthink we should, we should go through and review a whole host \\\\nof financial regulatory statutes to make sure that the credit \\\\nraising and capital disbursement mechanisms of our economy are \\\\nclear and not bogged down by red tape, which, unfortunately, \\\\nhas occurred over many decades, far before you and before me, \\\\nand we have to get that cleared up.\\\\n    One thing I want to discuss quickly is dealing with data \\\\nbreaches. It appears that the CFPB intends to include a strict \\\\nliability standard with respect to data breaches or \\\\nunauthorized accesses to credit report information by third \\\\nparties. Do you think the compliance costs are overly \\\\nburdensome on these institutions if, essentially, the \\\\ninstitutions are going to have a strict liability standard tied \\\\nto them?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Yes.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. It is not like the companies are begging to \\\\nget breached.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I think the question is often on unauthorized \\\\naccess. We have not proposed that. It is something that we are \\\\ntalking to the small entity representatives through the SBREFA \\\\nprocess about how a set of data might be used or shared. There \\\\nis sometimes an issue where they are sharing it, but then it \\\\nsays that it was unauthorized, so we are working through all of \\\\nthat before we propose----\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. Okay. The one thing I would vehemently stress \\\\nis we should not be assigning strict liability standards to any \\\\nof these institutions. Obviously, the regulatory burdens here \\\\nin the United States of America are large enough as is. \\\\nApplying strict liability over data breaches when it is clear \\\\nthat unless there is proof that the institutions actually \\\\ninvited the data breach on purpose, we should not be applying \\\\nthat level of liability to them. Nobody wants to see data \\\\nbreaches, I want to be clear on that, but we have to be careful \\\\nand mindful of the fact that our financial institutions don&#x27;t \\\\nwant that either.\\\\n    Quickly, the Section 1071 rule compilation of data for \\\\nminority- and women-owned businesses, and obviously \\\\nunderstanding that we want everybody to have full access to \\\\ncapital in our economy, do you feel that the level of data \\\\nbeing proposed in this rule is actually going to be more of a \\\\nhindrance and a burden as opposed to opening up flows of \\\\ncapital in the United States?\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. I am hopeful that, based on how we incorporated \\\\nthe comments, we complied with the statutory requirement, and \\\\nthere are lots of use cases for it, but we are doing exactly \\\\nwhat Congress asked us to do.\\\\n    Mr. Donalds. I would argue that what Congress asked for \\\\nunder the Dodd-Frank Act was ridiculous, but that was another \\\\ntime. I hope to change that as well. I yield back, Mr. \\\\nChairman.\\\\n    Mr. Chopra. Thank you.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. The gentleman yields back. I would like to \\\\nthank Director Chopra for his time today and his testimony.\\\\n    The Chair notes that some Members may have additional \\\\nquestions for this witness, which they may wish to submit in \\\\nwriting. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open \\\\nfor 5 legislative days for Members to submit written questions \\\\nto this witness and to place his responses in the record. Also, \\\\nwithout objection, Members will have 5 legislative days to \\\\nsubmit extraneous materials to the Chair for inclusion in the \\\\nrecord.\\\\n    I ask Director Chopra to please respond no later than \\\\nDecember 29, 2023.\\\\n    And with that, this hearing is adjourned.\\\\n    Voice. Good job, Mr. Chairman.\\\\n    Mr. Fitzgerald. Thank you.\\\\n    [Whereupon, at 2:53 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\\\\n\\\\n                            A P P E N D I X\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                           November 29, 2023\\\\n\\\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\\\n\\\\n                                 [all]\\\"}\""]
